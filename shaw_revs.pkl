V\u000aWhy do I want to write the 234th comment on The Shawshank Redemption? I\u000aam not sure - almost everything that could be possibly said about it\u000ahas been said. But like so many other people who wrote comments, I was\u000aand am profoundly moved by this simple and eloquent depiction of hope\u000aand friendship and redemption. The only other movie I have ever seen that effects me as strongly is To\u000aKill a Mockingbird. Both movies leave me feeling cleaner for having\u000awatched them.I didn't intend to see this movie at all: I do not like prison movies\u000aand I don't normally watch them. I work at a branch library and one day\u000aas I was checking The Shawshank Redemption out to one of our older\u000apatrons, she said to me, "Whenever I feel down or depressed, I check\u000aout this movie and watch it and it always makes me feel better." At the\u000atime, I thought that was very strange. One day there was nothing on TV\u000aexcept things I absolutely would not watch under any circumstance or\u000athings that I had seen too many times already. I remembered what she\u000asaid, so I watched it. I have watched it many many times since then and\u000ait gets better with every showing.No action, no special effects - just men in prison uniforms talking to\u000aeach other.The Shawshank Redemption and To Kill a Mockingbird are the best movies\u000aI have ever seen. I do not judge it by it's technical merits - I don't\u000areally care about that. I have read that Citizen Kane or The Godfather\u000aor this or that movie is the best movie ever made. They may have the\u000abest technique or be the most influential motion pictures ever made,\u000abut not the best. The best movies are ones that touch the soul. It\u000atakes a movie like The Shawshank Redemption to touch the soul.\u000a

V\u000a\u000aCan Hollywood, usually creating things for entertainment purposes only,\u000acreate art?  To create something of this nature, a director must approach\u000ait\u000ain a most meticulous manner, due to the delicacy of the process.  Such a\u000adaunting task requires an extremely capable artist with an undeniable\u000amanagerial capacity and an acutely developed awareness of each element of\u000aart in their films, the most prominent; music, visuals, script, and acting.\u000aThese elements, each equally important, must succeed independently, yet\u000astill form a harmonious union, because this mixture determines the fate of\u000athe artist's opus.  Though already well known amongst his colleagues for\u000ahis\u000anotable skills at writing and directing, Frank Darabont emerges with his\u000afeature film directorial debut, The Shawshank Redemption.  Proving himself\u000aalready a master of the craft, Darabont managed to create one of the most\u000arecognizable independent releases in the history of Hollywood.  The\u000aShawshank Redemption defines a genre, defies the odds, compels the\u000aemotions,\u000aand brings an era of artistically influential films back to\u000aHollywood.The story begins with the trial of a young banker, Andy Dufrense,\u000avictimized\u000aby circumstantial evidence, resulting in a conviction for the murder of his\u000awife and her lover.  After a quick conviction, Andy finds himself serving a\u000alife sentence at Shawshank prison, with no hope of parole.  He exists in\u000athis prison only in appearance, keeping his mind free from the drab walls\u000aaround him.  His ability to do this results in the gaining of respect from\u000ahis fellow inmates, but most of all from Ellis Redding.  Ellis, commonly\u000areferred to as Red, finds gainful use of his entrepreneurial spirit within\u000athe drab walls of Shawshank by dealing in contraband and commodities rare\u000ato\u000athe confines of prison.  Andy's demeanor and undeniable sense of hope\u000acauses\u000aRed to take a deeper look at himself, and the world around him.  Andy\u000aproves\u000ato Red and the other inmates that in the conventional walls of Shawshank\u000aprison convention will find no home in his lifestyle.By creating the film's firm foundation, the meticulously chiseled\u000ascreenplay\u000apaved the way for this film's success.  Frank Darabont outdoes himself with\u000athe phenomenal adaptation of Stephen King's equally noteworthy novella,\u000aRita\u000aHayworth and Shawshank Redemption.  In this novella, King demonstrates that\u000ahe can break free from the genre he dominates and still create a marvelous\u000apiece of modern literature.  Though the film mirrors the novella in many\u000aways, Darabont illustrates a focused objective of improving upon the areas\u000awhere the novella came up short, resulting in one of the best book to film\u000atransitions ever.While maintaining some of the poetic and moving dialogue of the novella,\u000aDarabont also proves that a film's score can generate a great deal of\u000aemotional response from its audience, as dialogue does.  He employs the\u000acunning Thomas Newman, son of the legendary Hollywood composer, Alfred\u000aNewman.  Darabont shows recognition for the film's needs by employing\u000aNewman, who makes the gentle piano chords whisper softly to the viewer, as\u000aif a part of the scripted dialogue.  Newman lends himself to individualism\u000aand tends to drive more towards the unique in the realm of score\u000acomposition.  His effort in Shawshank did not go unnoticed, as his score\u000areceived an Oscar nomination in 1995.  While unique and independent,\u000aNewman's score never once intrudes on your concentration or distracts from\u000athe film.With work from vast array of talented scene designers, costume designers,\u000acomposers, cinematographers, and various other Hollywood artists, the cast\u000aof The Shawshank Redemption had a strong foundation to work with.  The\u000amarvelous cast of this film will dazzle you with some of the most\u000aconvincing\u000aperformances you will witness in a film.  While both Tim Robbins and Morgan\u000aFreeman shine as Andy and Red, respectively, the true spectacle of acting\u000alies within the plethora of amazing supporting actors who easily disappear\u000ainto their roles.  Most noticeable of these, the veteran film star James\u000aWhitmore, who portrays the elderly Brooks Hatlen.  Brooks, a man\u000aincarcerated for an unmentioned crime for so long that he finds himself\u000aattached to the Shawshank and the daily life he has lead.  Each of these\u000aactors show a true dedication to their art, and a focused purpose in their\u000amotivations, creating a convincing setting that never once caters to\u000aanything unbelievable.With all of the aesthetic touches and attention to cinematic detail, the\u000amost beautiful part of the film lies within its thematic material, such as\u000aits focus on the human desires for the most abstract concepts, like hope\u000aand\u000afreedom.  These themes, which concern things the human spirit undoubtedly\u000ayearns for, seem so intricately woven into the plot that it easily draws\u000aits\u000aaudience in to its story.  Though full of hardened criminals, your heart\u000awill go out to these men as they display the most basic of human emotions,\u000aand deliver some of the most quotable lines in a film to date.  Like a\u000agreat\u000anovel, this film manages to succeed at greater things than simply\u000aentertaining an audience.  Darabont tells his story most masterfully,\u000aillustrating principles and inspiring his audience to think.  He leaves us\u000aa\u000apoignant film with a powerful message of hope, and redemption, something we\u000aall seek.This film manages to redeem Hollywood in the eyes of people who feared it\u000along lost in a dark sea of clichés and predictability.  Darabont shows us\u000athat artists still work in the Hollywood studios and production facilities.\u000aThese artists show their capability to produce art; real art that inspires\u000ayou to look at the deeper aspects of life and the world around you.  The\u000aShawshank Redemption delivers much-needed breath of fresh air for anyone\u000awho\u000arealizes the capability of film.  It proves that masters of the craft still\u000alive on this earth, and still bless us with timeless masterpieces that we\u000awill never forget.\u000a\u000a

V\u000a\u000aI have never seen such an amazing film since I saw The Shawshank Redemption.\u000aShawshank encompasses friendships, hardships, hopes, and dreams.  And what\u000ais so great about the movie is that it moves you, it gives you hope.  Even\u000athough the circumstances between the characters and the viewers are quite\u000adifferent, you don't feel that far removed from what the characters are\u000agoing through.It is a simple film, yet it has an everlasting message.  Frank Darabont\u000adidn't need to put any kind of outlandish special effects to get us to love\u000athis film, the narration and the acting does that for him.  Why this movie\u000adidn't win all seven Oscars is beyond me, but don't let that sway you to not\u000asee this film, let its ranking on the IMDb's top 250 list sway you, let your\u000afriends recommendation about the movie sway you.Set aside a little over two hours tonight and rent this movie.  You will\u000afinally understand what everyone is talking about and you will understand\u000awhy this is my all time favorite movie.\u000a

V\u000aThe reason I became a member of this database is because I finally \u000afound a movie ranking that recognized the true greatness of this movie. There \u000ais nary a word or scene out of place in the entire thing. Every element \u000acomes together to form an exquisite story for cinema. \u000a\u000aI believe that one reason that this movie is under-appreciated is that \u000apeople have not seen it multiple times. On first viewing it is the story of \u000aAndy Dufresne and his struggle to maintain hope despite his circumstances. \u000a\u000aHowever, this is really a movie about Red and his struggle to find \u000ameaning and purpose. The final segment of the movie testifies to the fact that the final resolution of the story comes about only when Red is faced with the same fearful situation as Brooks. Because of Andy, Red can find a\u000adifferent path-the path of freedom that is lit by hope.\u000a\u000aWho is your Andy Dufresne?\u000a

V\u000aIn its Oscar year, Shawshank Redemption (written and directed by Frank\u000aDarabont, after the novella Rita Hayworth and the Shawshank Redemption,\u000aby Stephen King) was nominated for seven Academy Awards, and walked\u000aaway with zero. Best Picture went to Forrest Gump, while Shawshank and\u000aPulp Fiction were "just happy to be nominated." Of course hindsight is\u000a20/20, but while history looks back on Gump as a good film, Pulp and\u000aRedemption are remembered as some of the all-time best. Pulp, however,\u000awas a success from the word "go," making a huge splash at Cannes and\u000amaking its writer-director an American master after only two films. For\u000aAndy Dufresne and Co., success didn't come easy. Fortunately, failure\u000awasn't a life sentence.After opening on 33 screens with take of $727,327, the $25M film fell\u000afast from theatres and finished with a mere $28.3M. The reasons for\u000afailure are many. Firstly, the title is a clunker. While iconic to fans\u000atoday, in 1994, people knew not and cared not what a 'Shawshank' was.\u000aOn the DVD, Tim Robbins laughs recounting fans congratulating him on\u000a"that 'Rickshaw' movie." Marketing-wise, the film's a nightmare, as\u000a'prison drama' is a tough sell to women, and the story of love between\u000atwo best friends doesn't spell winner to men. Worst of all, the movie\u000ais slow as molasses. As Desson Thomson writes for the Washington Post,\u000a"it wanders down subplots at every opportunity and ignores an abundance\u000aof narrative exit points before settling on its finale." But it is\u000athese same weaknesses that make the film so strong.Firstly, its setting. The opening aerial shots of the prison are a\u000atotal eye-opener. This is an amazing piece of architecture, strong and\u000aGothic in design. Immediately, the prison becomes a character. It casts\u000aits shadow over most of the film, its tall stone walls stretching above\u000aevery shot. It towers over the men it contains, blotting out all\u000amemories of the outside world. Only Andy (Robbins) holds onto hope.\u000aIt's in music, it's in the sandy beaches of Zihuatanejo; "In here's\u000awhere you need it most," he says. "You need it so you don't forget.\u000aForget that there are places in the world that aren't made out of\u000astone. That there's a - there's a - there's something inside that's\u000ayours, that they can't touch." Red (Morgan Freeman) doesn't think much\u000aof Andy at first, picking "that tall glass o' milk with the silver\u000aspoon up his ass" as the first new fish to crack. Andy says not a word,\u000aand losing his bet, Red resents him for it. But over time, as the two\u000aget to know each other, they quickly become the best of friends. This\u000aagain, is one of the film's major strengths. Many movies are about\u000alove, many flicks have a side-kick to the hero, but Shawshank is the\u000aonly one I can think of that looks honestly at the love between two\u000abest friends. It seems odd that Hollywood would skip this relationship\u000atime and again, when it's a feeling that weighs so much into everyone's\u000aday to day lives. Perhaps it's too sentimental to seem conventional,\u000abut Shawshank's core friendship hits all the right notes, and the film\u000ais much better for it.It's pacing is deliberate as well. As we spend the film watching the\u000asame actors, it is easy to forget that the movie's timeline spans well\u000aover 20 years. Such a huge measure of time would pass slowly in\u000areality, and would only be amplified in prison. And it's not as if the\u000afilm lacks interest in these moments. It still knows where it's going,\u000ait merely intends on taking its sweet time getting there. It pays off\u000aas well, as the tedium of prison life makes the climax that much more\u000aexhilarating. For anyone who sees it, it is a moment never to be\u000aforgotten.With themes of faith and hope, there is a definite religious subtext to\u000abe found here. Quiet, selfless and carefree, Andy is an obvious Christ\u000afigure. Warden Norton (Bob Gunton) is obviously modeled on Richard\u000aNixon, who, in his day, was as close to a personified Satan as they\u000acome. But if you aren't looking for subtexts, the movie speaks to\u000aanyone in search of hope. It is a compelling drama, and a very moving\u000afilm, perfectly written, acted and shot. They just don't come much\u000abetter than this.OVERALL SCORE: 9.8/10 = A+ The Shawshank Redemption served as a message\u000aof hope to Hollywood as well. More than any film in memory, it proved\u000athere is life after box office. Besting Forrest and Fiction, it ran\u000asolely on strong word of mouth and became the hottest rented film of\u000a1995. It currently sits at #2 in the IMDb's Top 250 Films, occasionally\u000aswapping spots with The Godfather as the top ranked film of all time --\u000aredemption indeed. If you haven't seen it yet, what the hell are you\u000awaiting for? As Andy says, "It comes down a simple choice, really.\u000aEither get busy living, or get busy dying."\u000a

V\u000a\u000aI believe that this film is the best story ever told on film, and I'm about\u000ato tell you why.Tim Robbins plays Andy Dufresne, a city banker, wrongfully convicted of\u000amurdering his wife and her lover. He is sent to Shawshank Prison in 1947\u000aand\u000areceives a double life sentence for the crime. Andy forms an unlikely\u000afriendship with "Red" (Morgan Freeman), the man who knows how to get\u000athings.\u000aAndy faces many trials in prison, but forms an alliance with the wardens\u000abecause he is able to use his banking experience to help the corrupt\u000aofficials amass personal fortunes. The story unfolds....I was so impressed with how every single subplot was given a great deal of\u000arespect and attention from the director. The acting was world-class. I have\u000anever seen Tim Robbins act as well since, Morgan Freeman maybe (e.g.\u000aSeven).\u000aThe twists were unexpected, an although this film had a familiar feel, it\u000awasn't even slightly pretentious or cliched, it was original. The\u000acinematography was grand and expressive. It gave a real impression of the\u000asheer magnitude of this daunting prison.But the one thing which makes THE SHAWSHANK REDEMPTION stand above all\u000aother\u000afilms, is the attention given to the story. The film depends on the story\u000aand the way in which it unravels. It's a powerful, poignant,\u000athought-provoking, challenging film like no other. If Andy were to comment\u000aon this film, I think he might say: "Get busy watching, or get busy dying."\u000aTake his advice.Thoroughly recommended.\u000a

V\u000a\u000aOne of the finest films made in recent years. It's a poignant story\u000aabout hope. Hope gets me. That's what makes a film like this more than a\u000amovie. It tells a lesson about life.\u000aThose are the films people talk about 50 or even 100 years from you. It's\u000aalso a story for freedom. Freedom from isolation, \u000afrom rule, from bigotry and hate. Freeman and Robbins are\u000amajestic in their performances. Each learns from the other.\u000aTheir relationship is strong and you feel that from the first\u000amoment they make contact with one another. There is also a\u000awonderful performance from legend James Whitmore as Brooks.He shines when it is his time to go back into the world,\u000aonly\u000ato find that the world grew up so fast he never even got\u000aa chance to blink. Stephen King's story is brought to the\u000ascreen with great elegance and excitement. It is an extraordinary motion\u000athat people "will" be talking about in \u000a50 or 100 years.  \u000a

V\u000a\u000aOne of my all time favorites. Shawshank Redemption is a very moving story\u000aabout hope and the power of friendship. The cast is first rate with\u000aeveryone\u000agiving a great performance. Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman carry the movie,\u000abut Bob Gunton and Clancy Brown are perfect as the Warden Norton and prison\u000aguard captain Hadley respectively. And James Whitmore's portrail of an\u000aelderly inmate Brooks is moving. The screenplay gives almost every actor at\u000aleast one or more memorable lines through out the film. As well as a very\u000asurprising "twist" near the end that almost knocked me out of my chair. If\u000ayou have not seen this movie rent it or better yet buy it. As I bet you'll\u000awant to see this one more than once.\u000a

V\u000aMisery and Stand By Me were the best adaptations up until this one, now\u000ayou can add Shawshank to that list.This is simply one of the best films ever made and I know I am not the\u000afirst to say that and I certainly won't be the last. The standing on\u000athe IMDb is a true barometer of that. #3 as of this date and I'm sure\u000ait could be number 1. So I'll just skip all the normal praise of the\u000afilm because we all know how great it is. But let me perhaps add that\u000awhat I find so fascinating about Shawshank is that Stephen King wrote\u000ait.King is one of the best writers in the world. Books like IT and the\u000aCastle Rock series are some of the greatest stories ever told. But his\u000abest adaptations are always done by the best directors. The Shining was\u000abrilliantly interpreted by Kubrick and of course the aforementioned\u000aMisery and Stand By Me are both by Rob Reiner. Now Frank Darabont comes\u000aonto the scene and makes arguably the best King film ever. He seems to\u000aunderstand what King wants to say and he conveys that beautifully. What makes this film one of the best ever made is the message it\u000aconveys. It is one of eternal hope. Andy Dufresne, played by Tim\u000aRobbins, has been sent to prison for a crime he did not commit. But he\u000anever loses hope. He never gives up his quest to become a free man\u000aagain. His years of tenacity, patience and wits keep him not only sane,\u000abut it gives his mind and a spirit a will to live. This film has a\u000adifferent feel to it. There has never been anything like it before and\u000aI don't know if there will again.I'm not going to say any more about this film, it has already been\u000asaid, but just suffice to say that I am glad that Forrest Gump won best\u000apicture in 94. I would have been equally glad if Pulp Fiction or\u000aShawshank would have won. It is that good of a movie and one that will\u000abe appreciated for years to come.\u000a

V\u000a\u000aThe Shawshank Redemption is without a doubt one of the most brilliant movies\u000aI have ever seen. Similar to The Green Mile in many respects (and better\u000athan it in almost all of them), these two movies have shown us that Stephen\u000aKing is a master not only of horror but also of prose that shakes the soul\u000aand moves the heart. The plot is average, but King did great things with it\u000ain his novella that are only furthered by the direction, and the acting is\u000aso top-rate it's almost scary.Tim Robbins plays Andy Dufrane, wrongly imprisoned for 20 years for the\u000amurder of his wife. The story focuses on Andy's relationship with "Red"\u000aRedding (Morgan Freeman, in probably his best role) and his attempts to\u000aescape from Shawshank. Bob Gunton is positively evil and frightening as\u000aWarden Norton, and there are great\u000aperformances and cameos all around; the most prominent one being Gil Bellows\u000a(late as Billy of Ally McBeal) as Tommy, a fellow inmate of Andy's who\u000asuffers under the iron will of Norton.If you haven't seen this movie, GO AND RENT IT NOW. You will not be\u000adisappointed. It is positively the best movie of the '90's, and one of my\u000aTop 3 of all time. This movie is a spectacle to move the mind, soul, and\u000aheart. 10/10\u000a

V\u000aThis movie is not your ordinary Hollywood flick. It has a great and\u000adeep message. This movie has a foundation and just kept on being built\u000aon from their and that foundation is hope.Other than just the message of this movie the acting was phenomenal.\u000aTim Robbins gave one of the greatest performances ever. He was\u000ainspiring, intelligent and most of all positive. His performance just\u000amade me smile. Robbins plays Andy Dufresne who was wrongfully convicted\u000aof murdering his wife and her lover. He is gets to life sentences but\u000ayet never gives up hope. In he becomes friends with Ellis Boyd "Red"\u000aRedding played by Morgan Freeman. Freeman who gives the finest\u000aperformance of his career has unlike Robbins lost hope. He is in deep\u000aregret of the crime that he committed. His way of deflecting the pain\u000aaway is by trying to not feel anything at all. With his friendship with\u000aAndy he learns that without our hopes and dreams we have nothing. Andy\u000aalso becomes friends with the rest of Red's group. James Whitmore also\u000agave a great performance as Brooks Halten who gets out of prison parole\u000abut in the words of Red he has been "institutionalized". The directing by Frank Darabont was just magnificent. He kept this\u000amovie at a great steady pace along with the writing and great\u000acinematography. He portrayed prison life in such a horrifying way, but\u000anot in terms of the physical pain but the stress and pain that wares\u000amentally on the inmates, some of which deserve a second chance. Whatever you do, don't listen to the people who say this movie is\u000aoverrated because this is one of the most inspiring and greatest movies\u000aever. It has everything you could possibly want.\u000a

V\u000a\u000aWhenever I talk about this movie with my friends, I do not even refer\u000ato it by title, but rather as "The Movie".  When I say "The Movie", my\u000afriends know exactly what I'm talking about.  In fact the main reason that\u000ame and my friends don't refer to it by title is because this movie is so\u000agreat, that we do not feel worthy enough to say it's name in\u000avain!\u000aI still remember the first time I saw The Shawshank Redemption.  Some\u000afriends of mine and I went to see it at one of those "Budget Theaters" over\u000athe summer of 1995.  None of us really knew anything about the movie, but we\u000ahad heard that it was pretty good.  So, not having any real expectations, we\u000asaw it.  When the final credits rolled and the lights came on in the\u000atheater, all of us just sat there with our jaws hanging down on the floor.\u000aI turned my head towards my friend Bob and said "That was the greatest movie\u000aI have ever seen in my entire life!"\u000aThere's really no other way I can put it in words.  Every moment of\u000athis movie captivated me and inspired me to believe in the one true thing\u000ain life...... "HOPE".  This movie is sad, uplifting, inspiring, harsh, cold,\u000afunny (at the right times), jaw-dropping, and heart-warming all at the same\u000atime.  I get chills every time I watch this film and this film contains the\u000agreatest ending (which takes place over the last 30 minutes or so)in movie\u000ahistory!  How it all just "comes together" is so incredible and uplifting.\u000aI should also mention the music in this movie is nearly flawless as well,\u000aand the soundtrack is a "must buy" for any music fan.\u000aThe only bad thing about this movie is the fact that I know I will\u000anever see a better movie, no matter how many I may see.  I've seen many\u000amovies over the past few years, many excellent films.  However, every time I\u000awalk out of the theater, I turn to my friend or family member that I saw it\u000awith and I say, "That was a great movie, but it wasn't nearly as good as\u000a'you know what'!"  There have been many movies over the past few years that\u000athought would really move me or that I might one day call my "favorite of\u000aall time", but they've all fallen far short of "The Shawshank\u000aRedemption".\u000aSo, if you have yet to see this movie, please run to the video store\u000aimmediately.  You're guaranteed to find it in the "employee picks" section.\u000aAnd if it isn't in that section, then you should tell the employees there\u000athat there is something seriously wrong with them.  If you have seen this\u000amovie, go see it again.  If you haven't bought your own copy yet, buy one.\u000aIn fact buy two, and put one in a fire-proof safe, just in case of an\u000aemergency. :o)\u000aSo, you want a 1-10 rating???  I give it a 13!!!!!!\u000a

V\u000aI'm trying to save you money; this is the last film title that you\u000ashould consider borrowing. Renting Shawshank will cost you five\u000abucks... just plunk down the $25 and own the title. You'll wind up\u000agoing back to this gem time and time again. This is one of few movies\u000athat are truly timeless. And it's entertaining and moving, no matter\u000ahow many times you view it.Forget about what others (including myself) might suggest you'll\u000adiscover in "The Shawshank Redemption;" when you watch it, you'll\u000aidentify something very personal in your own life with a scene, a\u000acharacter, or a moment in this uncomplicated movie. When you need hope,\u000ayou'll look for Shawshank. When you want to believe in the will of\u000aovercoming even the greatest obstacles, Shawshank will uplift you in\u000aways that you can't find in movies today. Some liken the film to some kind of spiritual awakening. Of course,\u000asome can go to a church or mosque to find enlightenment and Faith in\u000ahumanity, but most places of worship are open only certain days or\u000atimes. But when you need affirmation of the lasting bond of friendships\u000athat prevail over the most dire circumstances, Shawshank will give it\u000ato you. It makes grown men (like me) cry, still. I wonder whether\u000aShawshank was truly meant for viewing in the privacy of the home,\u000abecause it is a personal experience that really makes you look inward.\u000aNominated for seven, this is the best film that never one a single\u000aOscar. How ironic that an innocent man winds up being surrounded by the\u000acorruption of the legal system. Shawshank itself is similar to the\u000acharacter of Andy Dufresne. Prejudging this classic film, critics\u000acouldn't get past the title. The public followed suit, initially\u000adismissing Shawshank, which failed in the box office just like "It's a\u000aWonderful Life" and "Citizen Kane." It could have just whithered away\u000aon the store shelves, like Andy Dufresne could have in his own cell.\u000aBut the characters prevailed, because Andy -- And Shawshank -- stayed\u000atrue. Now, these movies are right up there as the most popular films of\u000aall time. Anyone who has yet to watch Shawshank may be so jaded of movies, or the\u000afilm's title, or how a 2-1/2- hour movie set inside the walls of a\u000aprison can manage to tap the soul of such a wide range of people.\u000aShawshank has not one explosion. I wonder if it even has a single\u000aspecial effect or digitally- enhanced frame. But every aspect of Shawshank fit together. The acting from the top to\u000athe bit part. The musical score. The editing. The photography. The\u000astory, from opening credits to final scene. All involved, including the\u000atown of Mansfield, Ohio (where Shawshank was actually filmed) played\u000atheir roles perfectly. Shawshank is a must- see, must- own title.\u000a

V\u000aAt the heart of this extraordinary movie is a brilliant and indelible\u000aperformance by Morgan Freeman as Red, the man who knows how to get\u000athings, the "only" guilty man at Shawshank prison. He was nominated by\u000athe Academy for Best Actor in 1995 but didn't win. (Tom Hanks won for\u000aForrest Gump.) What Freeman does so beautifully is to slightly\u000aunderplay the part so that the eternal boredom and cynicism of the\u000alifer comes through, and yet we can see how very much alive with the\u000awarmth of life the man is despite his confinement. Someday Morgan\u000aFreeman is going to win an Academy Award and it will be in belated\u000arecognition for this performance, which I think was a little too subtle\u000afor some Academy members to fully appreciate at the time.But Freeman is not alone. Tim Robbins plays the hero of the story,\u000abanker Andy Dufresne, who has been falsely convicted of murdering his\u000awife and her lover. Robbins has a unique quality as an actor in that he\u000alends ever so slightly a bemused irony to the characters he plays. It\u000ais as though part of him is amused at what he is doing. I believe this\u000ais the best performance of his career, but it might be compared with\u000ahis work in The Player (1992), another excellent movie, and in Mystic\u000aRiver (2003) for which he won an Oscar as Best Supporting Actor.It is said that every good story needs a villain, and in the\u000aBible-quoting, Bible-thumping, massively hypocritical, sadistic Warden\u000aSamuel Norton, played perfectly by Bob Gunton, we have a doozy. I want\u000ato tell you that Norton is so evil that fundamentalist Christians\u000aactually hate this movie because of how precisely his vile character is\u000arevealed. They also hate the movie because of its depiction of violent,\u000apredatory homosexual behavior (which is the reason the movie is rated\u000aR). On the wall of his office (hiding his safe with its ill-gotten\u000acontents and duplicitous accounts) is a framed plaque of the words "His\u000ajudgment cometh and that right soon." The irony of these words as they\u000aapply to the men in the prison and ultimately to the warden himself is\u000ajust perfect. You will take delight, I promise.Here is some other information about the movie that may interest you.\u000aAs most people know, it was adapted from a novella by Stephen King\u000aentitled "Rita Hayworth and the Shawshank Redemption." Rita Hayworth\u000afigures in the story because Red procures a poster of her for Andy that\u000ahe pins up on the wall of his cell. The poster is a still from the film\u000aGilda (1946) starring her and Glenn Ford. We see a clip from the black\u000aand white film as the prisoners watch, cheering and hollering when Rita\u000aHayworth appears. If you haven't seen her, check out that old movie.\u000aShe really is gorgeous and a forerunner of Marilyn Monroe, who next\u000aappears on Andy's wall in a still from The Seven Year Itch (1955). It's\u000athe famous shot of her in which her skirt is blown up to reveal her\u000ashapely legs. Following her on Andy's wall (and, by the way, these\u000apinups figure prominently in the plot) is Rachel Welsh from One Million\u000aYears B.C. (1966). In a simple and effective device these pinups show\u000aus graphically how long Andy and Red have been pining away.Frank Darabont's direction is full of similar devices that clearly and\u000anaturally tell the story. There is Brooks (James Whitmore) who gets out\u000aafter fifty years but is so institutionalized that he can't cope with\u000alife on the outside and hangs himself. Playing off of this is Red's\u000aperiodic appearance before the parole board where his parole is\u000asummarily REJECTED. Watch how this plays out at the end.The cinematography by Roger Deakins is excellent. The editing superb:\u000athere's not a single dead spot in the whole movie. The difference\u000abetween the good guys (Red, Andy, Brooks, etc.) and the bad guys (the\u000awarden, the guards, the "sisters," etc.) is perhaps too starkly drawn,\u000aand perhaps Andy is a bit too heroic and determined beyond what might\u000abe realistic, and perhaps the "redemption" is a bit too miraculous in\u000ahow beautifully it works out. But never mind. We love it.All in all this is a great story vividly told that will leave you with\u000aa true sense of redemption in your soul. It is not a chick flick, and\u000athat is an understatement. It is a male bonding movie about friendship\u000aand the strength of character, about going up against what is wrong and\u000aunfair and coming out on top through pure true grit and a little luck.Bottom line: one of the best ever made, currently rated #2 (behind The\u000aGodfather) at the IMDb. Don't miss it.(Note: Over 500 of my movie reviews are now available in my book "Cut\u000ato the Chaise Lounge or I Can't Believe I Swallowed the Remote!" Get it\u000aat Amazon!)\u000a

V\u000aThe Shawshank Redemption is written and directed by Frank Darabont. It\u000ais an adaptation of the Stephen King novella Rita Hayworth and\u000aShawshank Redemption. Starring Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman, the film\u000aportrays the story of Andy Dufresne (Robbins), a banker who is\u000asentenced to two life sentences at Shawshank State Prison for\u000aapparently murdering his wife and her lover. Andy finds it tough going\u000abut finds solace in the friendship he forms with fellow inmate, Ellis\u000a"Red" Redding (Freeman) . While things start to pick up when the warden\u000afinds Andy a prison job more befitting his talents as a banker.\u000aHowever, the arrival of another inmate is going to vastly change things\u000afor all of them.There was no fanfare or bunting put out for the release of the film\u000aback in 94, with a title that didn't give much inkling to anyone about\u000awhat it was about-and with Columbia Pictures unsure how to market it,\u000aShawshank Redemption barely registered at the box office. However, come\u000aAcademy Award time the film received several nominations, and although\u000ait won none, it stirred up interest in the film for its home\u000aentertainment release. The rest, as they say, is history. For the film\u000afinally found an audience that saw the film propelled to almost\u000amythical proportions as an endearing modern day classic. Something that\u000ahas delighted its fans, whilst simultaneously baffling its detractors.\u000aOne thing is for sure, tho, is that which ever side of the Shawshank\u000afence you sit on, the film continues to gather new fans and simply will\u000anever go away.It's possibly the simplicity of it all that sends some haters of the\u000afilm into cinematic spasms. The implausible plot and an apparent\u000asentimental edge that makes a nonsense of prison life, are but two\u000achief complaints from those that dislike the film with a passion. But\u000awhen characters are this richly drawn, and so movingly performed, it\u000astrikes me as churlish to do down a human drama that's dealing in hope,\u000afriendship and faith. The sentimental aspect is indeed there, but that\u000aacts as a counterpoint to the suffering, degradation and shattering of\u000athe soul involving our protagonist. Cosy prison life you say? No\u000achance. The need for human connection is never more needed than during\u000aincarceration, surely? And given the quite terrific performances of\u000aRobbins (never better) & Freeman (sublimely making it easy), it's the\u000aeasiest thing in the world to warm to Andy and Red.Those in support aren't faring too bad either. Bob Gunton is coiled\u000aspring smarm as Warden Norton, James Whitmore is heart achingly great\u000aas the "Birdman Of Shawshank," Clancy Brown is menacing as antagonist\u000aCapt. Byron Hadley, William Sadler amusing as Heywood & Mark Rolston is\u000aimpressively vile as Bogs Diamond. Then there's Roger Deakins' lush\u000acinematography as the camera gracefully glides in and out of the prison\u000aoffering almost ethereal hope to our characters (yes, they are ours).\u000aThe music pings in conjunction with the emotional flow of the movie\u000atoo. Thomas Newman's score is mostly piano based, dovetailing neatly\u000awith Andy's state of mind, while the excellently selected soundtrack\u000aranges from the likes of Hank Williams to the gorgeous Le Nozze di\u000aFigaro by Mozart.If you love Shawshank then it's a love that lasts a lifetime. Every\u000aviewing brings the same array of\u000aemotions-anger-revilement-happiness-sadness-inspiration and a warmth\u000athat can reduce the most hardened into misty eyed wonderment. Above all\u000aelse, tho, Shawshank offers hope; not just for characters in a movie,\u000abut for a better life and a better world for all of us. 10/10\u000a

V\u000a\u000a**Yes, there are SPOILERS here**This film has had such an emotional impact on me, I find it hard to write\u000acomments on it.  I've read a lot of the previous comments; all those that\u000agush and eulogise as well as those who think it's over-rated or cliched.\u000aMost have got good points to make, however the thing that I think everyone\u000ais struggling to both explain and come to terms with is just why this film\u000ais *so* loved.  Loved to the extent that for many it is an almost spiritual\u000aexperience or for those of a more secular nature like myself, loved as one\u000aof the most devastatingly uplifting things that can happen to you while\u000awatching a film.So I'm not going to review it, I'm just going to struggle in my own way to\u000aexplain this film.  It took me a few viewings to get why I connect with it\u000aso deeply, but here goes.Many people in this world are unhappy.  Most people in this world don't\u000awant\u000ato be unhappy.  Lots of people wish, pray and above all hope for that magic\u000awand to wave and wash them of their fears, losses, angers and pains once\u000aand\u000afor all.  They see lots of other people seemingly in this magical state,\u000awhile they suffer.  To borrow the words of another film, they're watching\u000athe bluebirds flying over the rainbow.Many unhappy people have learned that the magic wand doesn't exist.\u000aThey're\u000anot destined to join the bluebirds and fairytales don't come true.  It's\u000anot\u000athat no one lives happily ever after, it's just that they're not going to.\u000aThey're busy dying.In this film, or as some people have quite correctly said, this fairytale,\u000amagic wands exist.  And that magic wand is Andy Dufrense imitating Houdini.\u000aHowever this film is not about him.  Neither is it about the prison, the\u000agovernor, the guard, the plot, the acting, the cinematography, the script,\u000athe direction or the score.It's about Red.  He is the one who has become institutionally unhappy, he's\u000anot only trapped in a prison, not only has he given up on the idea of ever\u000aleaving, not only does he have no hope, he knows that if the miracle would\u000aever happen to him, he couldn't cope.  He's safe in his unhappiness and\u000athat\u000asecurity is what keeps him going.  Hope is, as Red say, dangerous.  The\u000ametaphor for a certain illness here is very clear to me and I know that a\u000arather large number of people suffer from it.  A large proportion of those\u000adon't understand what's wrong, but they certainly can recognise a fellow\u000asufferer.  Those who are mercifully untouched by this illness definitely\u000adon't understand what's going on in those who do.  They're too busy\u000aliving.The miracle in this film is not only that Red is redeemed but that the\u000aworld\u000aoutside the prison isn't all warm and sandy and sunny and with excellent\u000afishing.  Some of it is rocky and uncertain.  Fairytales don't get this\u000afar.\u000aThey'd end as Red left the gates of the prison and the credits would say\u000a'and he lived happily ever after'.  This is the only film I can currently\u000athink of where they show how to get to the living happily ever after bit\u000afrom your redemption via the rocky and uncertain ground of bagging\u000agroceries\u000aat the local store.  In other words, they're not going to cheat you and\u000atell\u000ayou everything's going to be alright.This is crucial.  For two and half hours, those of us who are quite content\u000ato mooch around our own personal prisons can see an escape route quite\u000adifferent to Andy's mapped out on the screen.  And it's a real way out.\u000aIt's hard and upsetting, but ultimately rewarding.  The high you get from\u000afinding out and knowing that is only comparable diamorphine.The trouble is, if you're already busy living, this film won't mean that\u000amuch and you'll see it a little more clearly than those busy dying.  To\u000athose fortunate individuals, watch this film and understand what the rest\u000aof\u000aus are going through.So, yes, this film is a cliched fairytale and maybe as a story it isn't\u000arealistic and at second on the IMDb all time list, it is a bit over-rated.\u000aHowever if you could have a chart of films listing the number of lives\u000asaved, altered and improved, the Shawshank Redemption would be way out in\u000afront at number one.\u000a

V\u000aProbably yes, acting was good, plot brilliant, I mean Stephen King\u000awrote the book, but it can't match the film. When I sow this movie I\u000athought "thats it, this is it, best movie ever". Sure you can find\u000apeople who didn't like it, and when I ask "why", and try to guess what\u000athen happened? They just confused themselves, they can say reason why\u000athey don't like this movie... When I try to read comments with 1/10\u000astar, I can't find comment with good reasons that could make me\u000arealize, that this movie is a bad movie, If there is no reason, then\u000athis means, that its the best movie ever made!The only reason people\u000aare giving 1 star is that they don't like ratio "9,2", they want to do\u000amore effect by pull this high ratio down, I really hate them :) Sorry\u000afor my bad English language, I live in EUrope, my English teacher is\u000abig cow with no knowledge...\u000a

V\u000a\u000aIn recent years the IMDB top 250 movies has had THE GODFATHER at number 1\u000awhile THE SHAWSHANK REDEMPTION has remained at number 2 . The only exception\u000awas early in 2002 when FELLOWSHIP OF THE RING topped the chart for a couple\u000aof months then dropped down to number 2 for a couple of more months . I`ll\u000aprobably make myself very unpopular for saying this but I don`t think\u000aSHAWSHANK REDEMPTION deserves to be so high !!!!!! SPOILERS !!!!!!What I don`t like about it is the amount of cliches . New prisoner arrives\u000aand finds a maggot in his food , prison cliche 37 . New prisoner gives\u000amaggot to old prisoner to feed his pet bird , prison cliche 43 . It`s\u000arevealed at the end that the prisoner who has spent so many years inside is\u000ainnocent after all , prison cliche numero uno . Did anyone believe during\u000aany part of this movie that Andy Dufresne was guilty ? Neither did I . Maybe\u000athat`s why I love the American prison series OZ because all the inmates\u000athere are totally guilty . There`s other things wrong with the movie . It`s\u000aabout half an hour overlong , and there`s rather unrealistic bits like the\u000awarder having someone killed after finding out Dufresne is probably innocent. Oh and how many prison friendships has there been between a black man and\u000aa white man ? Maybe that last point shouldn`t be taken as a criticism because the\u000aperformances of Morgan Freeman and Tim Robbins are very good and make the\u000amovie . Neither of them give a flashy performance ( Again not a criticism )\u000abut both are very subtle in their roles , can you imagine how different this\u000amovie would have been if we`d had Tom Cruise and Denzil Washington as the\u000astars ? Perhaps because Freeman`s character of Red does seem to have been\u000awritten as a white character he`s so good in the role . Am I alone in\u000athinking Freeman has been the best black actor in Hollywood for the last\u000adecade because he`s more interested in exploring the character instead of\u000aplaying someone who`s black ? There`s also some outstanding touches from director Frank Darabont . Witness\u000athe scene early in the film where Andy spends his first night in prison with\u000athe darkness falling upon the prisoners faces . It`s almost like the artwork\u000aof Andy Dogg as the prisoners look out onto the landing as they search for\u000afresh prey , and there is quite a touching sequence as Red leaves prison out\u000ainto the harsh outside world to the strains of Thomas Newman`s\u000ascoreI gave THE SHAWSHANK REDEMPTION eight out of ten . It is a classic feel good\u000amovie but unfortunately being a cynic I do think it`s slightly overrated by\u000aIMDB voters       \u000a

V\u000aThis touching and heart warming film is the most perfect celebration of the\u000ahuman spirit I have seen. Andy Dufresne, wrongly convicted of murdering his\u000awife and her lover, finds the strength not only to change himself, but to\u000abring hope to those around him in Shawshank Prison.  This inspiring story\u000ais interwoven with a soundtrack which invokes every emotion, from haunting\u000aand chilling, to stirring and beautiful. When you go to see a movie and it\u000atouches you with its poetry, music, and its atmosphere, and leaves you with\u000aa sense of victorious satisfaction, it is a triumph.  Field of Dreams was\u000athe first movie which invoked these emotions in me.  Shawshank Redemption\u000ais even more powerful for its simplicity.  It doesn't pretend to be clean,\u000anor could it be called a family movie.  It is brutal and violent at times,\u000ahorrifying and sickening at others. However the title says it all.\u000aRedemption is what this story is all about.  And it is not necessarily\u000aredemption for the actual crimes you might have committed, but it is\u000aredemption for the way you have lived your life.  What emerges can only be\u000acalled a maginificent piece of art.  This is what movies were meant to be.\u000a\u000a

V\u000aWe have all see movies, comedies, action and dramas. We all liked ones,\u000ahated others, got into some other even and felt like part of it. In\u000aShawshank Redemption; you start slowly, after a while you get attached,\u000aby the time you reach the middle of the movie you simply totally forget\u000aabout anything outside the screen and feel a mixed stream of emotions\u000agoing through you head before anything else! then comes a last 20\u000aminutes of heart storming that is surely enough to raise the adrenaline\u000ato extreme levels even in diabetics! I felt warm, strong, happy and all\u000aother emotions one can think of, I felt I was the one who won, who got\u000aout of prison, i was simply fully satisfied.This movie must be used as an Anti-depression by therapists! this movie\u000aproves that Oscars are either money bought gifts! or that who ever in\u000acharge of them are so smart that they couldn't give any Oscar to The\u000aShawshank Redemption knowing that the movie is on different - much\u000ahigher- rating scale than the Oscars.. it's simply over qualified!\u000a

V\u000a\u000aI reviewed this film recently with a specific question in mind. At this\u000awriting, this film is ranked by IMDB viewers as the second best film ever\u000amade. The SECOND BEST EVER MADE!Why? This was my question.The acting is good. Robbins and Freeman are quality craftsmen in the Caine\u000aand Hackman tradition. But these are not truly great actors and in any case,\u000athey are only asked to play appealing persons, deliberately less-dimensional\u000athan real (as opposed to believably hyper-real which is much\u000aharder).The director is a first-timer, and it shows. There is simple framing and\u000astaging here. In fact, there seems to be a deliberate strategy to be as\u000aplain as possible. And that is the core of where I think people find the\u000aappeal of this film.The story is very tight in the sense of narrative flow. All the chunks are\u000athe same size, with no fancy rhythm. There is no distracting backstory. No\u000aelement has irony, not writing, acting, shooting, even the\u000ascore.Now for me, I expect and demand art in my films -- that's why I register\u000athis as plain. But I think it is well liked because it is totally without\u000apretense. It is straight and honest; people seem hungry for honesty, and\u000athis has the appearance of what they need at just the right\u000atime.Is a film great because it merely fulfills? I hope many people think not,\u000aand dream that this film moves down the list to be replaced with more\u000aintelligent efforts.\u000a

V\u000aWhen I saw that the Shawshank Redemption was #1 on the top 250 movies\u000aof all time, I thought "Yea, I could understand that". I don't\u000anecessarily agree that it's absolutely the best, but it is so good that\u000ait makes sense that a forum of popular consensus for film rankings\u000awould rank it at the top.It is the story of Andy Dufresne, played by Tim Robbins and his time at\u000aShawshank Prison. It is a perspective of what it is to be human and to\u000ahave hope for the future even in the face of insurmountable adversity. It's funny, because I don't really think that any one particular thing\u000astands out as spectacular. The performances are very good, but nothing\u000areally noteworthy. The characters all serve the story beautifully, but\u000anone of them really stand out from the others. Frank Darabont is great,\u000athe shots are exactly what they should be. Almost the entire film is\u000ashot at the prison, adding to the feeling of isolation and routine.And yet, we are captivated from the outset. Morgan Freeman could read a\u000aSears catalogue and I'd pay to hear it, his narration breathes life\u000ainto every scene that it's spoken over. The real beauty of this film is\u000ait's story, mostly about Andy and Red (Robbins and Freeman), but it's\u000athe way that each character contributes symbiotically to the\u000adevelopment of the story that is the absolute mastery. Stephen King's novella "Rita Hayworth and the Shawshank Redemption" was\u000athe short story that was used as the basis for the film and it serves\u000aas evidence that King is not just a master of horror, but a true\u000aliterary genius. Sure, he doesn't use as many fifty cent words as\u000ahistories other great masters, but does anyone tell as good a story?\u000aKing always gives his writing such distinct atmosphere and energy that\u000ayou can't help but get swept away. The Shawshank Redemption is no\u000adifferent. If there is a film by which other films should be judged, this is as\u000agood as it can get. Powerful, engaging, visceral, despairing, a\u000amasterfully woven dialogue of what it means to be human. It's one of\u000athose journeys of the human spirit that just makes you feel happy to be\u000aalive.An amazing story translated beautifully to the screen. A masterpiece,\u000a10/10.\u000a

V\u000aA friend of mine listed "The Shawshank Redemption" as one her all time\u000afavorite movies and that brought on my curiosity what Shawshank\u000aRedemption was, I even thought it was a typo. The next day I went out\u000aand brought home the 10 years anniversary DVD without knowing I was\u000agoing to spend the most worthwhile 2 and a half hours of my life in\u000afront of the TV (a melodrama doesn't kill, right?)I don't know how to write a good movie review so I guess telling you\u000awhat I feel about it may do better. I remembered crying a few times,\u000abeing astounded by the plot twist for a moment or two and ending up\u000asitting alone, inert and all, just because of the once-in-a-lifetime\u000abeauty of Shawshank. Just recall the scene in which Andy locked himself\u000ain the room and turned the music on, all the cons stood paralyzed on\u000athe ground, listening to the magical tune like the song of hope they\u000ahad never heard before.Shawshank is more than a feel good movie, it's about life-changing\u000aexperiences, about the endless struggle against life's harshness and\u000aunfairness, about true friends who will stand by you forever... The\u000asimple yet hard to convey messages could not be handled more subtly\u000athan this.Shawshank should have won every Oscar for any categories it was\u000anominated, but it's all about struggling against unfairness, time's\u000aproved its monumental magnitude.Shawshank is a lesson of life that you have to learn in just 150\u000aminutes.\u000a

V\u000a  This is Tim Robbins best performance ever.

He\u000a meets a mentor in Red(Morgan Freeman) and they build a friendship that is\u000a stronger than the walls that surround them. Andy steadies a relationship\u000a with the warden that keeps him in the good eyes of the prison. Andy is\u000a full of surprises and uses his resourcefulness to not only win the\u000a friendships of his fellow prisoners, but also of the prison guards. Both\u000a Andy and Red both hold on to their dream of one day enjoying their freedom.\u000a  They turn their friendship and dreams of freedom into a bond that no\u000a prison could ever take away.\u000a

V\u000a\u000aTHE SHAWSHANK REDEMPTION is very enjoyable, features excellent performances,\u000aand has won a fanatical following among a lot of people.  I just saw it.  I\u000aliked it.  But as for becoming fanatically enthusiastic about it, all I can\u000asay is, folks, let's not get carried away...The story not only is incredibly *simple* (good man unjustly convicted for\u000ahorrible crime maintains hope in horrible confinement), but is also\u000aincredibly *simplistic* (the Warden and his men are evil goons, the convicts\u000aare good).  Complexity is something completely exiled from this\u000astory.The director, Frank Durabont, offers nothing new in his aesthetic choices --\u000aSHAWSHANK is stock Hollywood filmmaking, especially of the Spielbergian\u000avariety ala THE COLOR PURPLE and AMISTAD.  The soundtrack is overpowering in\u000aits efforts to imbue the story with "heartwrenching emotion."  The\u000acinematography is fine in a sort-of standard-issue, "seen it before"\u000away.Which begs the question:  Is there anything truly *exceptional* about THE\u000aSHAWSHANK REDEMPTION?  Heck yeah -- Morgan Freeman proves, once again, that\u000ahe is not only a wonderful actor but also one of the most endearing,\u000apowerful presences in cinema.  Tim Robbins is fine, along with all of the\u000aconvicts.But overall, I didn't mistake THE SHAWSHANK REDEMPTION for anything\u000aparticularly new, remarkable, exciting -- in other words, as anything worthy\u000aof fanatical enthusiasm.  It's a fine Hollywood film that looks, smells,\u000asounds and feels like your typical fine Hollywood film.  But nothing\u000amore.\u000a

V\u000aWell I guess I'm a little late to the party as far as writing down a\u000areview for this picture. I've seen it a couple of times, but that was\u000abefore I became a regular contributor to the IMDb. When I first\u000adiscovered this site a few years ago, "The Godfather" was in the Number\u000a#1 spot, and since then the films have traded places for first and\u000asecond, with Shawshank maintaining the top spot most of the time. That\u000apuzzled me a bit until I watched it again tonight, and I've come away\u000afrom the picture with a new found appreciation. My favorite movies tend\u000ato be the story of underdogs in some way, shape or form, and my\u000apersonal Top Ten list includes titles like "On The Waterfront", "To\u000aKill a Mockingbird" and "One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest". I may have\u000ato reconsider that list, an infrequent exercise but one I don't mind\u000adoing every now and then as situations warrant.Overall, the film is darn near perfect. I know it's pretty cliché to\u000astate it that way, but when you analyze the dialog, the characters, the\u000adirecting and the tone of the movie, the picture flows flawlessly, even\u000awhen it detours into side stories like Brooks Hatlen's release and new\u000aprisoner Tommy's introduction late in the picture. Every set-up, every\u000anuance has some importance that eventually converges to symbolize\u000aAndy's quest for escape and personal redemption. Remember Brooks\u000afeeding Jake for the first time and eventually setting him free when he\u000areceives his own pardon? How about Andy playing Mozart into the prison\u000ayard while settling back with a smile of contentment on his face. The\u000astory transcends one man's confinement for a crime he didn't commit,\u000aand focuses instead on his reaction to circumstances beyond his\u000acontrol. Paul Newman showed us a different way to react to those kinds\u000aof conditions in 1967's "Cool Hand Luke", but his method was self\u000adestructive. Andy Dufresne (Tim Robbins) never loses his ability to\u000akeep his eye on the prize, even if it takes him a couple of decades to\u000ado so.But even more so, you have here the story of Ellis Boyd Redding (Morgan\u000aFreeman), a convict who sees Andy as a person, and over time, an\u000ainspiration to himself and the rest of the prisoners who call him\u000afriend. From Andy, he comes to understand that even as a prisoner, a\u000aman can live life on his own terms if he can keep his mind uncluttered\u000aby thoughts of desperation and hopelessness. Not bad for a convict who\u000astarted out believing that 'hope can drive a man insane'.I really can't recommend this picture highly enough, both for it's\u000amasterful story telling and it's technical execution. The actors, even\u000athose portraying the most minor characters were seemingly born for\u000atheir roles. They deliver a seamless performance that's virtually\u000aunmatched by most modern films, in a picture that hits all the right\u000anotes with an inspiring message of discipline and perseverance.\u000a

V\u000aI first saw this film, like many others, by chance and on DVD. And like\u000aothers, I have since watched it over and over again. When I feel sad,\u000ait makes me feel happy, when I need hope, it gives me hope.When I want\u000ato reaffirm my very belief in life, and all it can offer, this film\u000agives me a new sense of purpose that no other film has ever come close\u000ato doing.It soars above anything any other movie has tried to achieve\u000ain the way it touches on the true virtues of life itself. The portrayal\u000aof friendship, the devastation of loss and the maintaining of hope.\u000aOutstanding performances from the two leads and the most beautiful of\u000anarratives are the tip of the iceberg of why this film is so great. The\u000acinematography from the very first shots of the prison are stunning and\u000athe accompanying soundtrack add to the haunting atmosphere when we\u000afirst venture inside the prison walls. Thank you Mr Darabont, Mr Robins\u000aand Mr Freeman. Thank you to every one else involved. You changed my\u000alife\u000a

V\u000aNone of the usual otherworld creatures that populate the works of\u000aStephen King are to be found in The Shawshank Redemption. But the real\u000aworld of that Maine prison has some bizarre rules of its own and\u000athere's a whole new reality within those walls.In the tradition of Cool Hand Luke and Birdman Of Alcatraz comes Tim\u000aRobbins who was a banker on the outside, but when he caught his wife\u000acheating on him with a golf pro from their country club, he's convicted\u000aof putting eight bullets in them, four apiece and tried and sentenced\u000ato two consecutive life terms in Shawshank prison. Like Luke and Bob\u000aStroud he works out his own rehabilitation and rebels against the\u000aprison system.He may be a con, but Robbins still has all his knowledge of finances\u000aand pretty soon he's made himself quite invaluable to the warden and\u000athe rest of the staff at the prison. At the same time he and the cell\u000ablock scrounger Morgan Freeman develop a close personal relationship.\u000aIn the end they beat the system in a most unique way.There have been some classic prison films made ever since The Big House\u000aat the dawn of the talkies. Two I've already mentioned. My favorite\u000aprison film is Robert Redford's Brubaker, but The Shawshank Redemption\u000acomes pretty close. As does The Green Mile which was also directed by\u000aFrank Darabont.Darabont got an Oscar nomination as did the film itself and as did\u000aMorgan Freeman for Best Actor. The Shawshank Redemption was in for a\u000aflock more Oscar nominations in 1994. A couple other good performances\u000aare that of James Whitmore the institutionalized con who is there for\u000a50 years and paroled and just can't make it on the outside. He will\u000abreak your heart as will Gil Bellows who plays a fresh, but rather\u000alikable young con who runs afoul of the warden.Speaking of which Bob Gunton as the warden will positively chill you\u000awith his corruption. You would have to go back all the way to the James\u000aCagney classic, The Mayor Of Hell where Dudley Digges was the warden of\u000aboys reformatory to find a warden that is as sanctimonious and as\u000acorrupt as Gunton. This is a man who gives Bibles out to each inmate\u000ahoping that the reading of the Good Book will improve the moral fiber\u000aof the convicts. At the same time he's raking in money every which way\u000ahe can and a rather special punishment is meted out to him by Robbins.The Shawshank Redemption may not have monsters and other worldly\u000acreatures that normally characterize a Stephen King story. But the\u000aworld of Shawshank prison is bizarre enough for any normal person if\u000ayou see this wonderfully crafted and acted film.\u000a

V\u000aFrom the director of 1990's "Buried Alive" comes perhaps the strongest\u000adrama of 1994. "The Shawshank Redemption" is emotionally fulfilling in\u000aevery way, uplifting its audience again and again. Darabont's\u000ascreenplay, adapted from (and expanded upon) Stephen King's short\u000anovella "Rita Hayworth and the Shawshank Redemption", is at once soul\u000astirring, heart-rending and disarmingly funny. As director, Frank\u000aDarabont brings this poignant and oft times surprising (largely\u000aunpredictable thank goodness) script to the screen with the kind of\u000aloving care that only a writer/director can, ensuring that all the\u000aright elements are brought to the surface.Startling performances from Tim Robbins, Morgan Freeman and the entire\u000asupport cast help make this picture a powerful production. As convicted\u000adouble murderer Andy Du Fresne, Robbins portrays innocence and\u000adetermination superbly. He's a man who not only strongly believes he\u000ahas a future, but that it's a good one. Freeman is spot on as the world\u000aweary "Red", the lifer who specialises in the supply of merchandise\u000a("whatever you want") to other inmates. He is gradually transformed,\u000aand always surprised, by Andy's optimism, geniality and brilliance. In\u000asupport of these two leads are some very strong turns which provide an\u000aover all feast of superlative acting talents.The cinematography is superb, capturing some spectacular images of the\u000aforeboding Shawshank prison, while Thomas Newman's music is awe\u000ainspiring and must be duly recognised as a truly moving composition."The Shawshank Redemption" is a long movie, though it would seem that\u000ato shorten it would mean to miss out on some powerful, if not crucial\u000ascenes. In this light, the editing team have done a marvellous job.What makes this film so effective is Darabont's brilliant script and\u000aastute direction, coupled with the strong acting and great support\u000aproduction. Darabont achieves all his objectives, making us laugh, cry,\u000alisten and think, he both surprises and inspires us many times. We're\u000aleft in the end with an uplifting and wholly satisfying movie, which is\u000aunexpectedly memorable and magnificently rewarding. A definite triumph\u000aof the human spirit.Perhaps the conclusion could be called simplistic, but certainly not\u000aexpected, and that's what makes this story so great. "The Shawshank\u000aRedemption" comes from nowhere to really hit you with its well written\u000acharacters and even its carefully researched history. Wonderfully\u000aemotionally telling and thankfully intellectually sharp, its a pleasure\u000athat you must treat yourself to! Look for two brilliantly played\u000acharacters in the form of the menacingly sinister Warden (Bob Gunton)\u000aand the despicable, ruthlessly violent Captain of the Guards (Clancy\u000aBrown).Thursday, July 27, 1995 - Waverley Pinewood Cinema"The Shawshank Redemption" was the surprise of 1994 from director Frank\u000aDarabont. Full of emotional highs both comic and poignant, it is by far\u000athe best prison film I've ever seen. Performances from Tim Robbins and\u000aMorgan Freeman are truly inspired, whilst a classy support cast lend\u000astrong backing. Cinematography is at times breathtaking and Thomas\u000aNewman's score is sweeping and melodic.For uplifting cinema that constantly comes form nowhere to move its\u000aaudience you can't go past "The Shawshank Redemption."Tuesday, April 30, 1996 - Astor Theatre\u000a

V\u000aLike I did a few years back, you might be hesitating about watching\u000athis film. The title didn't appeal to me, and neither did the subject\u000amatter, so it was only by chance that I started to watch it.I can only say that the film was a revelation for me and has stayed\u000awith me ever since. There are so many dark and hopeless films out there\u000awhich, whilst they leave an impression, leave the wrong one i.e that\u000athere is no hope in life. Watch this film and be uplifted and be\u000aencouraged by the message...that there is ALWAYS hope....in any\u000asituation.Please watch this film and the watch it again. It's a great answer to\u000aall the cynicism that is out there.\u000a

V\u000a\u000aAt first, before starting the movie, I thought "Sounds like a typical\u000aprison\u000ariot and break-out kind of movie". At the beginning of the movie, my\u000athoughts was even more convincing. A large prison (Which immediately\u000areminded me of the movie "The Last Castle" from 2001), housing people of\u000aall\u000asorts, having it's guards, warden and of course, the inmates. The typical\u000ainmate; Roughneck, hard on the outside, broken on the inside. And they all\u000aclaim their innocence, as an internal joke sort of speak.It gets to a point where I started comparing it with others. That proved\u000awrong in quite a short while, from the point where a prisoner, framed for\u000amurder of his wife and her lover, is being convicted and sentenced to life\u000ain prison. His name was Andy Dufresne. In short terms, a straight-up bank\u000aemployee, excellent with numbers and taxes, which he also uses to benefit\u000awithin the walls of the prison. His reputation as a numerological genius\u000aspreads out, and soon all kinds of people, inmates and guards, are coming\u000ato\u000ahim for financial advice. He builds up a library, he maintains a strict\u000asurface. He has his hobbies, to keep his mind busy (as said in the movie).\u000aHe carves chess pieces out of stone, using an axe as the tool. Seemingly,\u000athis is a nice and lucrative hobby, but underneath it all, he has a\u000asecret...The movie keeps the viewer thrilled and excited, because in every minute,\u000asomething could happen. The dialog is good, Tim Robbins and Morgan\u000aFreeman,\u000aboth great actors, shows and outstanding play. The crew really did good\u000awork\u000aon the set, the right camera angles, the light, sounds and so on...it was\u000aalmost like I could smell the prison!A brilliant movie. Not too short, not too long. It's worth every minute\u000awatching! My highest recommendation for those who like drama, action and\u000ahumor.\u000a

V\u000aThis is the best movie I have ever seen. In a way I feel I am in a\u000aprison of life myself. Restricted to doing certain things. Sometimes I\u000aget frustrated and feel as I should runaway to some place where I could\u000afeel free. I hope and dream for it sometime. This movie just reminds me\u000aof my feelings so much. I love Andy Dufresne most in this movie.\u000aAlthough critics say Tim Robbins didn't do enough to express the\u000acharacter but my personal opinion is that he was made for this role.I can go on and say more but I said the most important thing which I\u000afeel whenever I watch it.I am glad to visit IMDb. I never heard of it before. Some 7 years ago I\u000asaw it at no.2 in the rankings and decided to watch it immediately.\u000aOnly other movie which even comes close to this is Citizen Kane. But\u000athat is about past and this one is about hope and freedom.I give it 11/10.\u000a

V\u000aAs an omnivorous reader movies are always second to books to me. I\u000abelieve....movie can never defeat the book because while reading book\u000awe use our own imagination....and movie narrows down the\u000aimagination.....it only allows us to see how the director has imagined\u000athe book.But Believe me...this is not the case of The Shawshank\u000aRedemption...which I rate as the best movie I have ever seen.For the\u000afirst time in history the book(the Stephen King Novella) has been\u000adefeated by its movie version.After watching the movie I was crazy\u000aabout reading the book....I thought wow!the movie is so good...how will\u000abe the book!!To tell U frankly,the book is good, but the movie is\u000abest.There are some unforgettable scenes in the movie which were not in\u000athe book.Some examples are: The scene when Andy locks up the guard and\u000aplay the opera on the microphone.The narration goes on like.."I didn't\u000aunderstand a single word that Italian lady was singing...but I tell\u000aU..for that single second every soul in the Shawshank prison felt\u000afree..."The scene just fill my heart with Andy's yearn for freedom...I\u000awas kinda shocked when I didn't find it in the original book version.I can remember another scene.While Andy creates the prison library and\u000astarts listing books sent to prison from charity organizations...a\u000afellow inmate tries to read a name on the book...Alexandre Dumas as\u000a"Dumb-Ass". Andy says...."its not Dumb-ass...its Dumas..and U may like\u000athe book..The Count of Monty Cristo...its about a jailbreak.And the\u000acategory it falls is Fiction" Then Red says.."Why don't we put it on\u000aEducational category?"(Right before Andy listed an engineering handbook\u000aas "Educational" category).As Count of Monticristo is one of my\u000afavorite books, I was hysteric watching this sophisticated joke.This\u000awas also not in the book.This DVD is my favorite gift I give my friends. And after they watch\u000ait....they always thank me . Like many other IMDb friends commenting on\u000athis movie..I would also like to say.."Shawshank Redemption is the best\u000amovie I have ever seen in my life".Thanx to all.\u000a

Personally, I find it a bit too long and a little too sweet for my taste,\u000abut its far from a bad film. On the other end of the spectrum I have yet to understand why this film was\u000anominated for as many Oscars as it was and why so many people have fallen in\u000alove with it. To place it on the same level as The Godfather and several\u000ahundred other films has to be the result of different tastes.This is a film that should be seen because its a good movie, not because its\u000aa great one.\u000a

V\u000aI will never forget the first time I watched "The Shawshank\u000aRedemption", with my father. Both of us were fans of prison and\u000amale-bonding movies, and choose the film only expecting to watch a\u000asolid drama. Needless to say that, when the last line was delivered and\u000athe TV screen painted the walls with a beautiful blue, the feeling that\u000awe had just watched something exceptional instantly cut through our\u000ahearts, and before the second viewing, we would regularly mention how\u000agreat that film "with the poster" was.Then I would never miss it whenever I found it on TV, and after each\u000aviewing, it unveiled one unsuspected element of its unique appeal. I\u000aguess if it doesn't justify, at least it explains why this movie that\u000adidn't do well in the theaters, had a better success on VHS, TV and DVD\u000abefore it would ultimately dethrone "The Godfather" from the first\u000aplace on IMDb Top 250. And it's only justice if "The Shawshank\u000aRedemption", the least spectacular of the four Best Picture nominees in\u000athe glorious 1994, made by a relatively unknown director, a movie with\u000aan appeasing and appealing patience, took its time to grow on people\u000aand did it pretty well, as if it applied its own philosophy, patiently\u000abut determinedly. This is the strength of "The Shawshank Redemption", its ability to tell\u000aa story that spans a long period of time without trying to get to the\u000aso-called essential, the simplest things take their full meanings, the\u000asmallest details have their share of importance. And think about it, in\u000aa prison where everyone wears the same outfits, where the days are\u000aregulated by the same routine, all you can do is to make a life out of\u000athis routine, make a place, to get closer to your own definition of\u000a'having a life'. And as we penetrate the impressive walls of Shawshank,\u000afrom the first vertiginous panoramic shot, we're literally submerged by\u000athe solemn austerity of the location, conveying a very hostile feel.\u000aThese characteristics are perfectly incarnated by the figure of the\u000aWarden Samuel Norton, who's like the male alter-ego of Nurse Ratched\u000afrom "One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest". And the comparison with\u000aForman's film isn't fortuitous as Shawshank intends to domesticate its\u000aoccupants to the same limits of mechanical alienation, to the point\u000athat the only thing left to the inmates is to control their only\u000avaluable treasure: time, by getting busy, finding their own\u000areason-to-be, like the veteran Brooks (James Whitmore) was the man with\u000athe books, Red, remarkably played by Morgan Freeman, was the man who\u000acould get you things.In a very intelligent move from the script, the hero of the film, the\u000alaconic Andy Dufresne, an upper-class banker, played in all nuance by\u000aTim Robbins, is condemned to a life sentence at Shawshank, for the\u000amurder of his wife and her lover. And nothing indicates if he is\u000ainnocent or guilty and I wondered if any certitude would have\u000aconditioned my appreciation of the character. I think it was necessary\u000afor us to have a reasonable doubt about his innocence in order to let\u000ahis character progressively grow on us until we believe by ourselves\u000athat he was indeed the victim of unfortunate circumstances, the same\u000afeeling that grew in the heart of Red before becoming his best friend.\u000aMorgan Freeman is the pillar of the film while Tim Robbins is its free\u000aspirit, both allow us in a remarkable complementarity to dream of\u000aabstract notions like hope and freedom while being practical and 'busy'\u000ain the same time. And again, their friendship is a slow process that\u000atakes its time to progress and reaches a pivotal point when Andy was\u000aallowed to put his banker's casket again and feels that prison didn't\u000adeprive him from his 'social quality'. Shawshank is not slow but more a\u000apatience-demanding film with a sense of decency in the way it trusts\u000aour intelligence. And the film's motto, on which relies its philosophical core is "Get\u000abusy living or get busy dying". Now, two things occur to me while\u000awriting these lines, a heart-breaking sequence about the inmate Brooks\u000awho was freed after 50 years of detention, and who realized he was\u000ainstitutionalized. A notion explained by Red: when the infamous wall\u000athat scared you so much becomes your personal guiding light while\u000aoutside, it's all dark and your time is deconstructed. Brooks couldn't\u000alive outside Shawshank so there was no other way he could live. The\u000asecond thing is the sad passing of Steve Jobs today. And as I was\u000areading his famous Stanford speech, I couldn't help but make a\u000aconnection with the beautiful message of Darabont's film, an invitation\u000ato dream, to escape from any sort of walls or obstacles put in your\u000alife and heart with as many dreams as you can fulfill, a notion\u000aillustrated by the beautiful scene when Andy put some classical music\u000aon the microphone, so the prisoners could for once elevate themselves\u000aand having an ephemeral moment of pure freedom, this is the triumph of\u000ahuman spirit, this understanding of the value of life is "The Shawshank\u000aRedemption"In the same vein than "One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest", "Shawshank" is\u000aa constant encouragement to fight the system and use time for the best,\u000afor whatever constitutes our dreams, being men again, able to enjoy, to\u000afeel, to give a meaning to our lives. In other words, hope, hope that\u000athings can get better despite the adversity. To quote Steve Jobs :\u000a"Courage is the discovery that you may not win, and trying when you\u000aknow you can lose." This is the true intelligence of life, what makes\u000ait worth living."The Shawshank Redemption" a powerful adaptation of Stephen King's\u000anovel is one of the greatest American films: a powerful story of\u000acourage, perseverance, hope and ultimately, friendship and humanity.\u000a

V\u000aWhen I first saw the Shawshank Redemption, I was in a movie theater on\u000aa week night at around 11pm. I had gotten out of work from working the\u000aevening shift. I was tired and just wanted a little amusement. This was\u000aat a time after Shawshank had been released but got little attention. I\u000ahad heard some Oscar buzz so my curiosity got the better of me. I half\u000areluctantly chose to watch it. That night, I was not prepared to be\u000ablown away. I didn't see a movie, I was transported by a story. I was\u000ainstantly transcended into realizing why films should be made to begin\u000awith. I wasn't just entertained, I was emotionally moved and\u000aintellectually bamboozled in the most endearing manner. If this film\u000aremains on IMDb's number one spot for a long time to come, It's well\u000adeserves it. To me personally, the Shawshank Redemption is a testament\u000aas to why the 90's were an interesting decade but more than that, why a\u000afilm can become an experience and gain instant classic status. There\u000aare two simple rules you should follow prior to watching T S R: one, if\u000ayou haven't seen it, don't let any one who HAS seen it tell you\u000aanything about its plot, Don't listen to a word caus they might ruin it\u000afor you. Two, make arrangements not to be interrupted when watching the\u000afilm; no phone calls, no door bells, no other plans. Watch it from\u000abeginning to end. You can't over hype this film it's just that good.\u000aWhat i've written here is just a small fraction of what I can further\u000aexpress by way of praise for the film. Long live The Shawshank\u000aRedemption on IMDb !\u000a

V\u000aMaybe I'm writing a review too late for this movie, but I think I must\u000awrite something for this.Shawshank Redemption is a truly A Class movie that teaches us many\u000athings like friendship and never gave up your hope. Unlike other users,\u000aI think this movie deserves to be in IMDb Top 250 list. Today, IMDb's\u000aTop 250 List approved and considered by everyone. So, everybody must\u000asee that this movie is in top and must watch it to see why IMDb puts\u000athis movie on top and not Godfather.I really like the role of Red by Morgan Freeman. He really acts like a\u000aexperienced jail-mate. Andy Dufresne is okay too.What I really like is that, I really love the end. Maybe this is the\u000abest ending ever. I really like how Red laughs to Andy about pickaxe\u000aand Andy dig 19 years ( WOW !) to made a hole in the wall, how he\u000aescape and become a person he made it up for Warden's dirty job, how\u000ahis dreams come true and lastly after 5 years in jail after Andy\u000aescaped, how Red not decided to suicide, decided to follow Andy.Best Movie Ever...10/10\u000a

V\u000aAn outstanding film dealing with prisons as seen by several prisoners.\u000aMany social problems are discussed here. The picture earned a\u000awell-deserved best picture Oscar nomination. It certainly should have\u000atied with the winner, the equally good "Forrest Gump."Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman etched unforgettable performances as\u000aprisoners charged with murder. The film shows what prison life is all\u000aabout. Subjects dealing with prison survival, brutality, corruption and\u000aultimate redemption are well shown.As the corrupt, insane warden invoking religion to justify his actions,\u000aMr. Gunton gives a worthy performance.This is a film of rare power. James Whitmore was equally memorable as a\u000aprisoner who was unable to adjust to the outside after his parole\u000afollowing a 50 year stint. This shows that people who have been\u000aincarcerated for such a long period, need some sort of readjustment\u000atraining before they rejoin society. For Whitmore, freedom meant\u000aultimate doom.Politics is also depicted in a negative way in this gritty film. This\u000ais a memorable viewing experience for audiences.\u000a

V\u000aThere are few movies that capture and identify with the American male\u000aspirit. Shawshank is one of those movies. I don't care what anyone's\u000atake is on prison treatment or whether you are conservative or liberal,\u000athis movie is moving. There are three movies, in my opinion, that every\u000aman, or developing man, should watch: Shawshank Redemption, Dancing\u000aWith Wolves, and Brave Heart. Unless you are a total pansy, these are\u000athe movies that will confirm your heterosexuality. Andy Dufrane is the\u000aperson in us. Red is the person we want to be. Aside from the being in\u000aprison, the job they have is well apt to the people of this great\u000anation.\u000a

V\u000a\u000aOccasionally you go into a cinema and all the films you wanted to see were\u000afull. As you've come this far and you're a bit of a film fan you go to see\u000aa\u000afilm you've heard nothing about. I did this 6 years ago, with expectations\u000alow and a boredom threshold to match I sat and waited to be disappointed. 2\u000ahours later I walked out of the cinema a different person, before I had not\u000abeen moved by a film, I didn't care if : Indiana Jones made it, Sonny\u000aCorleone got wacked, Fred married Ginger, ET got home. Before, films were\u000aeither plot driven or character driven, they were action or comedy, sad or\u000ahappy, a few came along that combined a number of facets that I enjoyed,\u000arespected  or challenged how I viewed an issue or a person.Shawshank was different, there were characters I believed, not just one or\u000atwo but virtually all. Throughout the first hour I was gripped the full\u000arange of emotions were explored, the second hour building on the characters\u000awas even more powerful, some characters came and went but ultimately this\u000awas a story of 2 people: Red and Andy. I have never seen a film that so\u000aeloquently and beautifully illustrates friendship and hope.This has become the benchmark by which I judge all movies. I am pleased\u000athat\u000aI am not alone in feeling this way. I am glad that it did not win oscars as\u000aI feel individual endorsement is stronger than any vested interest award\u000aceremony, I relish telling everyone this is my favourite\u000afilm.\u000aI have seen it many times and will see it many more.\u000a

V\u000a\u000aThe Shawshank Redemption is one of the few movies adapted from books that\u000aturned out to be good .. or in, this case, brilliant.Although the movie supposedly takes place somewhen in the 1950's, I can\u000aeasily imagine it being transferred to today's time and standards. The thing\u000athat is most fascinating about is is that the directors [and writers, of\u000acourse] didn't use extreme clichés - there's no black and white painting,\u000ajust numerous shades of grey. Robbins and Freeman both are perfect for their\u000aroles, as are all of the supporting actors.Finally, I can understand why a certain movies gets a high\u000aranking.\u000a

V\u000a\u000aAll is perfect : the complexity of the characters, the suspense, the\u000aprincipals themes like friendship, loneliness, injustice, redemption,\u000avengeance, freedom... The most complete movie that i've ever seen. Tim\u000aRobbins is great, sensitive, brilliant: in one scene, he can feel a thousand\u000aof feelings. Freeman is very correct and seems to be really "Red". Gunton,\u000aSadler and all the others seemed to have fun playing in this master of\u000apeace. Titanic is pure entertainment and received 11 oscars. This movie\u000adeserves 30 oscars because it shows what is really important in life. No\u000aaction, more realistic, more useful than the other films. It was really a\u000aBIG BANG in my head the first time i saw it. When i see it again, I think\u000aand I realize the incredible power that the cinema's industry have. In a\u000adifferent way, only Star Wars, Saving Private Ryan and some others have the\u000asame impact.\u000a

V\u000aI made my account on IMDb Just to Rate this movie. :-) I had heard from\u000asomeone that Tim Robins has done a great job in this movie. but when i\u000astarted watching this movie, i could not move my ass for 142 Min.its not just about Tim Robins or Morgen Freeman.. its the whole\u000astoryline,dialogs and cinematography which insist you to watch this\u000awhenever you feel low in your life.Movie has some great lines. When Andy(Tim Robins) brake the Jail,\u000aMorgon Freeman says "I have to remind myself that some birds aren't\u000ameant to be caged. Their feathers are just too bright" This movie has\u000aentertainment, Feelings, Action, Drama a little comedy. In short\u000aeverything we want to see in a movie.I have seen this movie around 100 times and sure will watch more then\u000a10000 times before i die. 1 of the best movies i have ever seen in my\u000alife.. Wish i could see that sort of movie again in my life\u000a

The performances delivered by Robbins and Freeman are, to me, the\u000apinnacle of both their careers. This film cannot help but evoke tactile\u000aimagery to the fullest capacity. You feel what the main characters are going\u000athrough the sensation is uncanny. Robbins (Andy) and Freeman ("Red") are a\u000abalance of the human spirit. Andy is your freedom-seeking hope side and\u000a"Red" is your rational, pessimistic counterpart. Find your equilibrium in\u000a"The Shawshank Redemption."\u000a

V\u000aBefore watching Shawshank Redemption for the first time, I really\u000adidn't think much of it. I thought it had probably wrongfully earned\u000athe #1 spot here on IMDb, and couldn't be better than The Godfather for\u000aexample. A movie that was "cool" to like, if you will. I could imagine\u000afashion conscious movie-hipsters discussing movies over their glasses\u000aof Napa Valley Chardonnay, arguing who liked Shawshank Redemption the\u000amost, and which movie by Ingmar Bergman had the strongest metaphorical\u000amessages. You get the idea.I'm sure everything I have to say about the way the movie has been made\u000ahas been said better in one of the other comments. That said, the\u000areason I'm posting this review is because Shawshank Redemption isn't\u000aonly a hardcore movie freak's wet dream. While it's brilliantly\u000awritten, has some of the most fluent acting I have seen and shows the\u000afantastic directing skills of Frank Darabont, you really don't have to\u000abe an expert of film theory to appreciate it. It appeals to so many\u000adifferent groups of people, and so many different human feelings at the\u000asame time. The "weaknesses" it had as it came out (the idea of a jail\u000amovie not being compatible with the female population, and the idea of\u000aa movie about lifelong friendship between two men not being compatible\u000awith the male population) is actually the reason Shawshank Redemption\u000ais loved by nearly all: It offers something for everyone.In my opinion rating something 10/10 is a bit too absolute for\u000aanything, but since this is probably the best movie I remember seeing,\u000aand my first 10/10, I think I'll let it slide this time.\u000a

V\u000aShawshank Redemption is without doubt one of the best films ever made,\u000aand definitely the best film of 1994. Yes, it is better than Lion King,\u000aand I really like that too. It is not only enthralling but powerful and\u000amoving too. I will confess that I didn't understand it when I first saw\u000ait as a lot happens in the film, and I have now seen it three times. I\u000aseriously hope, that those who ignored the film when it was first\u000areleased now recognise it as a great film, as it really is. The\u000adialogue was extremely well-written, with lines that really stick in\u000ayour mind. The cinematography and music are both gorgeous, and the\u000aprison itself is like a character that dominates the film. In the\u000ascript, there are some true elements of Stephen King Now I admit I am\u000anot a huge king fan, and usually don't like coarse language in books.\u000aBut in his books like It, which is very good, I have accepted the\u000alanguage represents brutality and rebellion, shown perfectly in the\u000afilm with the battle of acceptance I suppose between the inmates and\u000athe superiors(like the scene with the warden yelling coarse language at\u000athe new inmates lined up in a row at the beginning.)The acting was\u000aexceptional. I am not hugely familiar with Tim Robbins, but he did a\u000agreat job in a very demanding role. The best performance however, comes\u000afrom Morgan Freeman as Red, who was seriously robbed of that Oscar,\u000athat he lost to Tom Hanks for Forrest Gump. Freeman reminds me very\u000astrongly, or his style of acting does, remind me of that of Sean\u000aConnery, suave yet very charismatic. Acting isn't just about your vocal\u000arange, it's about depth, which was what Freeman certainly had. In\u000ashort, Freeman was brilliant in what could be his best performance. The\u000ascene where the inmates are listening to the Mozart aria over the\u000aspeakers was a beautiful profound moment, and I actually cried in\u000aBrook's death scene. Very rarely do King adaptations translate-to\u000ascreen well, because of the large scale of the author's books, with the\u000aexception of this and the Shining. Some like It and Dreamcatcher are\u000agenuinely memorable but have a number of flaws that prevent them from\u000abeing classed as outstanding. And some, like Thinner and Tommyknockers\u000athat border on unwatchable. In conclusion Shawshank is a brilliant\u000afilm, that is worthy of the credit it has been denied for so-long.\u000a10/10 of course. Bethany Cox.\u000a

V\u000aThe Shawshank Redemption is a story of life itself. It is not about a\u000aperson in prison, it is about the soul and the battle it accepts and\u000acarries on to deserve the life it has been given by God. I watched the\u000amovie for the first time some months ago. That evening I was about to\u000ago out with some friends but out meeting was canceled and I had to stay\u000ahome. Being unhappy about that, I started watching the movie on the TV\u000ajust by chance, not knowing about its existence before that at all. At\u000afirst I was skeptic, I admit that. But oh God, at the end of it I was\u000ascreaming and jumping in my room at 1 AM! It gave me so much emotions\u000aand so much hope, I had never felt before that. I could hardly believe\u000athat a movie could make me feel that way - so excited, so happy about\u000amy life, leaving me believing so much in my own self. It is a great\u000astory of what the strength of your thoughts can make you do. In The\u000aShawshank Redemption desire does not make you weak, just the opposite -\u000agives you wings to fly away from fear, fly closer and closer to\u000afreedom. Morgan Freeman's voice is just another advantage that makes\u000athe movie even more impressive. Tim Robbins' act is just beyond\u000aperfection! I bought the DVD this summer and every time I feel weak or\u000ajust bad about something, I watch the movie. It has become my personal\u000ashrink, making me feel strong enough anytime I watch it. Can never\u000aimagine a better movie made anywhere in the world even after 1000\u000ayears!\u000a

V\u000aI still can't quite get the enormous reputation of this film. I saw it\u000aagain last night and instead of clearing up the mystery, the mystery\u000agot thicker. It is enjoyable film with very good performances by Tim\u000aRobbins, Morgan Freeman, James Whitmore etc, but...the most highly\u000arated film ever? I don't get it. The voice over alone seems to belong\u000ato a so so film. I love Morgan Freeman's voice but he's telling us what\u000awe're seeing. So, the sterling reputation damages the enjoyment of the\u000afilm because one is expecting something that never, really, arrives.\u000aThe most interesting aspect is Tim Robbins's psychological journey.\u000aCredible or incredible doesn't quite matter, I did go with him without\u000aasking too many questions. Morgan Freeman's humanity is contagious and\u000ainspiring, whether credible or not because I bought it. So, a\u000amasterpiece? No. Good, even very good? Yes.\u000a

V\u000aThere are only a handful of films that have shaken me to my core and\u000acontinued to resonate with me for very long after their first viewing.\u000aI can happily say that "The Shawshank Redemption" has stuck to me since\u000aI finished watching it for the first time, and instantly rocketed up my\u000aTop 10 Films list. Most great films have one or two obvious flaws that can be easily\u000apicked out - not so in "Shawshank", at least not to me. The hefty run\u000atime doesn't put me off because the story and characters are just so\u000awell rounded and so easy to return to time and time again. "Shawshank" is one of those films that I would love to experience for\u000athe first time all over again. The thrill of emotions and the highs and\u000alows I felt that first time are incomparable to much else. In my opinion, "Forrest Gump" was not as deserving of the Best Picture\u000aOscar as this. The timeless feel of a story of friendship in a hopeless\u000aplace will likely continue to capture generations of people for years\u000ato come.\u000a

V\u000aAnd I truly mean that. When I first saw this film, I was blown\u000aaway.With superb acting, superb story, perfect emotion and tone, and an\u000aincredible twist ending that still amazes me, this film is completely\u000aand utterly perfect. The film speaks of hope, and the film's two main\u000acharacters debate throughout the movie about it. One character believes\u000athat, in prison, hope is dangerous, and that it should not be used\u000abecause it will simply make life tougher. Another character believes\u000athat hope is needed, because it helps you to keep pushing for a better\u000atomorrow when one does not appear to be in sight. While very engaging and immensely entertaining, this film would not be\u000aheld to such high regards if not for the twist ending, which is one of\u000athe greatest movie endings of all time, in my opinion. If the ending is\u000amerely average, this film would simply be considered good, possibly\u000agreat, but not the masterpiece that it is today. And, watching it\u000arepeatedly makes the film even better, because experiencing the events\u000athat occur within the story makes the ending even greater. I can't speak for everybody, but this is a film that I can watch over\u000aand over again, and love it more each time I watch it. And, while I\u000asimply talked about the ending this entire review, that is not all that\u000amakes this film incredible. However, I will not waste any more of your\u000atime talking about how wonderful this film is. And please do not waste\u000aany of your own time. Find a way to see this movie as ASAP. It will be\u000atime well spent, and you will certainly see it multiple more times.\u000a

V\u000a'The Shawshank Redemption' is perhaps one of, if not the, perfect film.\u000aEvery other "great film", or any film for that matter has it's pros and\u000acons. Most motion pictures that are as well received as this have\u000aplenty going for it, very few against it. While I feel there are films\u000aout there with better pros; the pro to con ratio of 'The Shawshank\u000aRedemption' out-stands any other film film ever produced. I can't begin to describe every amazing element of this film. Obviously\u000athe performances are exquisite, the directing is exceptional and the\u000ascore is extraordinary. The cinematography, in particular, struck me.\u000aRoger Deakins is a master with light and framing. I will watch this film again and again and remember it as one of the\u000agreatest films ever made. This film truly lies within the sweet spot of\u000acinema.\u000a

V\u000aA very, very, very brilliant film. The acting is superb from Tim\u000aRobbins and Morgan Freeman, as always. The script was amazing, along\u000awith the directing. The film is one of the best films ever made due to\u000ahow original it is. And the reason it is original is because it is a\u000aprison film with heart. It makes you care about criminals. The score is\u000aalso very good.It's an enthralling piece of cinema and just... Amazing. I'd recommend\u000athis film to anyone due to everyone relating to it. People like films\u000awere you are sympathetic towards a criminal, just look at A Clockwork\u000aOrange.\u000a

V\u000aIt is really amazing movie i have ever seen in my lifetime. The cast\u000aand the story of the movie are really successful. Andy is a passionate\u000acharacter, and he is convicted of murdering his wife and her lover\u000adespite his claims of innocence. It is so touching to spend almost two\u000adecades in the prison. Old-fashioned prisons in the 90s are full of bad\u000aguy who don't expect anything from the life. And , they don't think how\u000awe escape here. However; Andy with his close friend in the prison , Red\u000a, tries redemption from this prison, by the time , Andy tries to do\u000abeneficial things for people in the prison not to attract attention. It\u000ais unbelievable that they escape from this prison. But , Andy\u000aapproaches to place of exit. It is actually amazing , it is really\u000aincredible. They go to their dreams to live a peaceful and quiet life.\u000aAlso; Andy prepares a trap for the chief of the jail. After the\u000aredemption , they become free anymore. It is really an amazing movie.\u000aEasily one of the best movies made during the 90s and definitely one of\u000athe top 'prison' movies of all-time. Pretty much everything about this\u000amovie works and works extremely well!\u000a

V\u000aDeservedly ranked at the top of IMDb's all-time best 250 films ever.The casting is superb: Morgan Freeman is "Red," a wise observer of\u000apeople and an entrepreneur inmate who's made "connections" so he can\u000aget contraband to other inmates for a price; he's under a life sentence\u000afor murder. Tim Robbins is "Andy," a smart banker and accounting whiz\u000awho was sentenced to 2 life terms for killing his wife and her lover\u000a(which he--like most other inmates, say they're not guilty of). And Bob\u000aGunton is "Warden Norton" who, when we first meet him, is touting the\u000avirtues of Bible reading and strict discipline. While, fortunately,\u000aI've had no first hand experience, "Shawshank" certainly gives the feel\u000aof authenticity of prison life and its society.A long movie, most of it takes place inside a semi-corrupt state\u000apenitentiary in the late 1940s. "Red," in talking his thoughts out loud\u000ato himself, becomes our narrator for many developments. As the story\u000aunfolds, increasingly we come to see Andy as a person with strong\u000apersonal values which he upholds in the most difficult situations. And\u000ain Andy's work for Warden Norton, we also increasingly find the warden\u000aas morally his opposite: selfish and fundamentally lacking decent moral\u000acharacter--all show and appearance and with no integrity, substance.In Roger Ebert's first review (of his two) of this movie, he said:\u000a"....the film is an allegory about holding onto a sense of personal\u000aworth, despite everything....the word redemption is in the title for a\u000areason...." Most viewers will agree.\u000a

V\u000aThe story begins with the trial of a young banker, Andy Dufrense,\u000avictimized by circumstantial evidence, resulting in a conviction for\u000athe murder of his wife and her lover. After a quick conviction, Andy\u000afinds himself serving a life sentence at Shawshank prison, with no hope\u000aof parole. He exists in this prison only in appearance, keeping his\u000amind free from the drab walls around him. His ability to do this\u000aresults in the gaining of respect from his fellow inmates, but most of\u000aall from Ellis Redding. Ellis, commonly referred to as Red, finds\u000againful use of his entrepreneurial spirit within the drab walls of\u000aShawshank by dealing in contraband and commodities rare to the confines\u000aof prison. Andy's demeanor and undeniable sense of hope causes Red to\u000atake a deeper look at himself, and the world around him. Andy proves to\u000aRed and the other inmates that in the conventional walls of Shawshank\u000aprison convention will find no home in his lifestyle.By creating the film's firm foundation, the meticulously chiseled\u000ascreenplay paved the way for this film's success. Frank Darabont\u000aoutdoes himself with the phenomenal adaptation of Stephen King's\u000aequally noteworthy novella, Rita Hayworth and Shawshank Redemption. In\u000athis novella, King demonstrates that he can break free from the genre\u000ahe dominates and still create a marvelous piece of modern literature.\u000aThough the film mirrors the novella in many ways, Darabont illustrates\u000aa focused objective of improving upon the areas where the novella came\u000aup short, resulting in one of the best book to film transitions ever.While maintaining some of the poetic and moving dialogue of the\u000anovella, Darabont also proves that a film's score can generate a great\u000adeal of emotional response from its audience, as dialogue does. He\u000aemploys the cunning Thomas Newman, son of the legendary Hollywood\u000acomposer, Alfred Newman. Darabont shows recognition for the film's\u000aneeds by employing Newman, who makes the gentle piano chords whisper\u000asoftly to the viewer, as if a part of the scripted dialogue. Newman\u000alends himself to individualism and tends to drive more towards the\u000aunique in the realm of score composition. His effort in Shawshank did\u000anot go unnoticed, as his score received an Oscar nomination in 1995.\u000aWhile unique and independent, Newman's score never once intrudes on\u000ayour concentration or distracts from the film.With work from vast array of talented scene designers, costume\u000adesigners, composers, cinematographers, and various other Hollywood\u000aartists, the cast of The Shawshank Redemption had a strong foundation\u000ato work with. The marvelous cast of this film will dazzle you with some\u000aof the most convincing performances you will witness in a film. While\u000aboth Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman shine as Andy and Red,\u000arespectively, the true spectacle of acting lies within the plethora of\u000aamazing supporting actors who easily disappear into their roles. Most\u000anoticeable of these, the veteran film star James Whitmore, who portrays\u000athe elderly Brooks Hatlen. Brooks, a man incarcerated for an\u000aunmentioned crime for so long that he finds himself attached to the\u000aShawshank and the daily life he has lead. Each of these actors show a\u000atrue dedication to their art, and a focused purpose in their\u000amotivations, creating a convincing setting that never once caters to\u000aanything unbelievable. http://howtogetridofacnequick.org\u000a

V\u000aThe Shawshank Redemption is an aesthetic adaptation of a much repeated\u000acliché 'where there's a will, there's a way'. It is a monumental piece\u000aof art that can chill, thrill, excite and rejoice any type of audience.\u000aIt renders a remarkable story of hope, trust, courage, determination\u000aand friendship while at the same time exploring the not-so-pleasant\u000athemes of corruption and police brutality.It tells a story of 'Andy Dufresne' (played by Tim Robbins), a banker\u000awho is falsely accused of murdering two people. It shows Andy's prison\u000alife as he tries to adopt to his harsh surroundings while at the same\u000atime developing a close bond with an aging but active inmate (played by\u000aMorgan Freeman) and his comrades. As the story develops, Andy rises in\u000apopularity as the warden himself starts using Andy for his private\u000abusiness.The film offers a commendable soundtrack, brilliant cinematography and\u000aan astounding storyline. Both Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman are\u000aexceptional in their performances, moreover, Bob Gunton also gives a\u000abrilliant performance of the villainous warden.On the whole, this film offers its viewers a kind of emotional\u000aenlightenment, a kind which forces every viewer to reevaluate his\u000astance on his life and goals. A must watch!10/10\u000a

V\u000aFrom the summary above which you will have seen, i stated the film to\u000abe a moving masterpiece. Right from the word go i was drawn into the\u000afilms twisting emotional plot. It caught my attention that Frank\u000aDarabont has placed a small amount of aspects into the film that get\u000athe audience emotionally involved in which we base ourselves into\u000asimply putting our feet in one of the convicts shoes. Tt especially\u000acaught my eyes with the montage of shots in which the character Brooks\u000a(James Whitmore) takes his own life, the non-diagetic sound adding to\u000athe other element of suspense of the scene and the devastation of the\u000atragic loss of the character in which we have been following through\u000athe course of the film. The cinematography throughout the film was\u000abasic and what i would term as standard, seen before basic film\u000acamera-work. If this was better it would have highly improved the films\u000aoverall watch. throughout the course of the film we see Andy Dufresne\u000a(Tim Robbins) supposedly framed for the murder of his wife and her\u000alover. We see how he progresses through the twenty years he spends at\u000aShawshank Prison. We see Robbins act brilliantly as the role of a\u000animble, lost and lonely convict turn into a reliant of the Head Warden.\u000aThis all becomes of the fact that in Dufresne's previous life he was a\u000acity banker, which is where he gets the nickname of 'wife murdering\u000abanker' around the dim lit prison. Morgan Freeman also shows that he is\u000aone of the worlds leading role- modelling actors as he pulls of another\u000asupreme unique perform. The way he acts during the duration of the film\u000ais entirely versatile proving the Freeman is an exceptional actor and\u000aperforms single handed an outstanding performance.The plot consists of many twists and turns with both leading characters\u000agetting into difficult situation and how they overcome them, or not.The final half an hour of the film is soul touching and what i would\u000aterm as an emotional rollacoaster with a large twist at the end. As\u000asuspense builds it creates a sensational climax tagging the film a must\u000awatch!I generally don't watch films more than once or twice but this is a\u000adifferent story. It still amazes me to this day and still gets me\u000amoving every time, it also influences me a lot.If you haven't watched this i highly recommend you do so!Joe Ferrari\u000a

V\u000aIm not going to sit here and go into a deep explanation of what this\u000afilm is about, because that has been thoroughly explained in many of\u000athe other reviews. What I will say is that The Shawshank Redemption is\u000awithout any doubt the most amazing film ever written. The acting is\u000atremendous, the story is original, and the movie itself has a deeper\u000ameaning to it. This movie is not about the hardships of prison, it is\u000aabout the importance of friendship and the realization that hope is\u000ayour greatest aspect. This piece does not focus as much on Andy and his\u000agreat escape from Shawshank, but more on Red finding that there is\u000aalways meaning and a purpose for everything. The story really unfolds\u000awhen Brooks, an old timer that Andy and Red had been close friends\u000awith, is put on parole and released from prison. After confronting the\u000aoutside world and knowing that he could not cope with it, Brooks finds\u000athat he has no purpose outside of life in jail and hangs himself. Later\u000ain the movie, after Andy makes his great escape from prison, Red is\u000afinally released from Shawshank himself, and is put in the same\u000asituation as Brooks. Only one reason marks the fact that Red himself\u000adidn't commit suicide. That reason is Andy. Red figures out that he\u000adoes have a purpose outside of prison which is to see his best friend\u000aagain and to "give him a handshake". And as the movie comes to a\u000amarvelous ending, that hope to see Andy becomes a reality.Overall the best movie I have ever watched and I am glad to say that I\u000awill continue to keep watching it again and again and again.\u000a

V\u000aThe 'Shawshank Redemption' undoubtedly deserves to be the highest rated\u000amovie. The movie depicts how a four lettered word 'Hope' brings wonders\u000ato our lives and makes something impossible to possible.Though the plot of the movie focuses on how Andy Dufrane, a falsely\u000aconvicted prisoner gets out of the prison, the beauty of the movie lies\u000ain the characterization of Andy Dufrane (just amazing) and how he\u000ainfluences his fellow prisoner 'Red'. The narration by Morgan Freeman\u000ain the role of 'Red' is perhaps one of the best narrations i have ever\u000acome across. This story proves that the king of horrors, Stephen King,\u000ais equally good at any other genre of 'Story Writing'(Hats off). The\u000adialogues towards the end of the movie about hope are truly inspiring.\u000aThe background score of the movie is excellent. Tom Robbins and Morgan\u000aFreeman at their best in the roles of Andy Dufrane and Red\u000arespectively.Didn't watch the movie??...go grab a DVD and watch it as soon as\u000apossible.

HOPE  One word that drives all of us and gives us\u000areason to live. We push ourselves through our mundane lives in the hope\u000aof achieving / finding something that we dream of. In the words of this\u000amovie's protagonist  "hope is a good thing, maybe the best of things,\u000aand no good thing ever dies"!!!

V\u000aThis movie I'm not going to call this film the IMDb #1 movie, but I\u000areally can't deny that this is fantastic. The cast, the score, the\u000awriting, and the power are all here in this film, and filled with\u000astrength. It's one of those movies that you will continue to think\u000aabout even after the film is over. It is about a friendship, a life, an\u000aevil, and a hope. A hope that is considered in many ways to be bridge\u000ato insanity inside the prison walls. We see these people as years of\u000atime goes by. We see friendships grow, and topics change. It really\u000aputs you in the prison, and makes you feel what's like to behind those\u000abars. You feel the friendship, the hope, the darkness, and the pure\u000ahorror of it all.4 stars out of 4\u000a

V\u000aI never saw this film on the silver screen. I didn't want to see it on\u000avideo either.The video store owner implored me to watch it and I remember my\u000aemphatic reply. "I'm not watching a 3 hour film about a prison con\u000adoing tax returns for the guards". Fortunately for me, this video store\u000aowner was a mightily persistent sort and I begrudgingly walked home not\u000aknowing that I had just rented the greatest film ever made.This film received no hype nor the mega-bucks publicity given to a lot\u000aof movie trash out there. Because they didn't need to - all they needed\u000ato do was to let people watch it because word of mouth is the best\u000amarketing ticket in town. And so it proved.The movie is long and relies on a storyline which has been covered many\u000atimes. Wrongful conviction, brutality in jail, justice in the end. But\u000ait is the way in which the story is told and acted out that defines it,\u000aquite rightly, as IMDb's top ranked film.I don't care for Stephen King as an author but his vivid imagination\u000acoupled with his skill at telling a story (a short story in this case)\u000ais top drawer. We have a man (Dufresne) who after being convicted\u000awrongfully for murder, uses his accounting skills in jail solely to\u000asurvive. Red (Freeman), the man who can "get things" befriends him. The\u000astory then slowly unravels with shocking scenes of brutality\u000aintertwined with flickers of how the human spirit can overcome the most\u000ahazardous odds. The Warden, Samuel Norton, is magnificent as a man\u000awhose corruption has spiralled out of control and will do almost\u000aanything to retain the status quo. Clancy Brown as the brutal guard\u000acompletes the double act.The story twists and turns leaving the audience not quite knowing\u000awhether we are in for a harrowing or euphoric ending. And when the\u000aending comes on that Mexican Beach you can almost hear the triumphant\u000acheers ringing around the cinema halls.This is film making at its very best and it is highly unlikely that\u000aRobbins and Freeman will ever better it. Its one of those few occasions\u000awhere 10 stars is not nearly high enough.So if you have been living under a rock or are as sceptical as I was in\u000athe early 90's, then it's time for me to adopt my friendly video store\u000aowners guise and say "Watch this - its the best film ever made".\u000a

V\u000aThe Shawshank Redemption is a simple but profoundly moving tale of\u000ahope, friendship & redemption that connects deeply with each & every\u000aone of us in some way. The film tells the story of Andy Dufresne, a\u000asuccessful banker, who is wrongfully convicted of murdering his wife &\u000aher illicit lover and is sentenced to two consecutive life terms in\u000aprison and covers his journey over the next two decades where he learns\u000ato adjust, makes new friends, finds himself useful to everyone in some\u000asort & cleverly hides his fierce determination for freedom.Just like the movie, its entire cast delivers a relatively simple but\u000avery sincere & touching performance. Tim Robbins delves deep into his\u000acharacter of Andy Dufresne amazingly well & evolves him beautifully as\u000athe movie progresses. But if Robbins was at his best, then Morgan\u000aFreeman is even better as Red, Andy's friend who is also serving a life\u000asentence & is notable amongst the inmates for smuggling goods into the\u000aprison. Freeman also narrates the story to us where he does an even\u000abetter job. Their presence did overshadow the inputs of the rest of the\u000acast but it's never so extreme that viewers start rejecting the other\u000acharacters' lives outright.The Shawshank Redemption is Frank Darabont's debut film as a director &\u000ahe just couldn't have asked for a better start. All this film has is\u000amen in either prison or police uniforms talking to each other\u000athroughout its runtime and yet it never looked dull or seemed to be\u000adragging for a single moment. Cinematography is fluid in capturing the\u000aspiritless & monotonous existence of life inside prison. Editing\u000asteadily paces the gradual progression of Andy's life, his friendship\u000awith Red, & his determination to not give in to the confines of the\u000aprison. And last but not the least, the score by Thomas Newman is pure\u000apoetry.On an overall scale, The Shawshank Redemption mainly stresses that\u000abased on the outlook of life, there are two types of people: one who\u000acan be free even in prison while others who find themselves imprisoned\u000aeven in freedom. The message that this film is trying to resonate is\u000aclear; Fear can hold you prisoner. Hope can set you free. And that\u000aeverything that has a beginning has an end, even sorrow & misery. Yes,\u000athe film seems all preachy n everything, but then if there has ever\u000abeen a cinema that has earned this kind of right, it's The Shawshank\u000aRedemption. Thoroughly Recommended.Full review at: cinemaclown.wordpress.com\u000a

V\u000aI haven't seen too many movies that I would rate a 10, but I had no\u000aproblems giving this one top score.Movie-making seems to be like golf; for a truly excellent game, ALL the\u000aelements must come together. Everyone involved must have perfect\u000a"form". Director, Darabont, must have been at the top of his game when\u000ahe put this gem together. Of course the actors were excellent; Morgan\u000aFreeman and Tim Robbins seldom disappoint. The thing that makes this\u000amovie exceptional is that Darabont coaxed the best performances out of\u000athe supporting actors also. Bob Gunton and Clancy Brown were utterly\u000abelievable (and bad guys don't come much worse than them).The other essential ingredient for a successful movie is simple: It\u000amust have a well thought out plot with a perfect beginning, middle and\u000aend. So many movies fall over by getting at least one of these aspects\u000awrong. Not so with Shawshank Redemption. Just like Goldilocks said,\u000a"This is just right!" Buy this one for your home collection because\u000ayou'll definitely want to see it again.\u000a

V\u000aI always define films as an artistic medium for a person to immerse\u000ahimself to a place full of positivity and hope in an unending hymn. And\u000afor generation after generation there's only one film that I will\u000aalways give praise for, finally giving a masterpiece that successfully\u000adelivers that thought. A film called The Shawshank Redemption.Never has been before the film came out, illustrates the triumph of\u000ahuman spirit behind any hardship in the most moving manner until this\u000ainspiring film. It's powerful in every way, that for me it brought back\u000athe real definition of an excellent film which is "a great story with\u000agreat characters".Mainly about Andy Duferne (Tim Robbins) a skilled banker who was\u000aconvicted for murdering his wife and her third party who's a pro\u000agolfer. Duferne, sentenced for double life imprisonment was sent to the\u000anotorious and sullen looking Shawshank prison to serve his sentence.\u000aWhile counting his days inside, several events happened to Andy.\u000aMeeting "the sisters " was one of his hardships he needed to go\u000athorough, as they sexually assault selected prisoners like him, which\u000amade his stay harder and longer than he thought. One day, he also met\u000aEllis Redding (Morgan Freeman) who was literally known to get things\u000aand run it through the walls of the prison, as Andy asked him for a\u000ahammer. Unknown to Andy, Redding had his bet on him earlier, as the\u000afirst one amongst the newest batch of inmates to break down. Subtlety,\u000athe two became prison buds as the days became months and the months\u000abecame years. The two almost stick together the whole time of their\u000astay. They conversed things about the realities of prison. Which at\u000atimes they contradicted at each other's opinion for Andy had always\u000abeen the "hopeful dreamer" and Redding with his face of realism.The story soon evolves into great circumstances in favor of Andy, in\u000aspite of being a workhorse inside the prison, exploited by several\u000apolice and the warden himself for his skill of handling money, Andy\u000athrough his skill, will, and hope proved that there were great things\u000awaiting to happen for those who hoped and wait. For he always believed\u000athat HOPE is a great thing, that everyone should always have.The Shawshank Redemtion is a film for the ages. Its beauty as a whole\u000awill never fade as it is one of those greatest films that show an\u000aalmost tangible message to fathom. It is substance over style at the\u000aend of the day. And what it evokes is what matters which leaves you\u000amoved and some even satisfied for every tear that they shed from an\u000aabundance of happiness gave by a magnificent piece of literature.It's the best film I've seen and it will always be carved to the bank\u000aof triumphant feeling.Truly excellent, 10/10.\u000a

V\u000aWell let me start off by saying I felt compelled to write this review\u000ato spite the numerous people who give it a 1 out of 10 "because they\u000afeel it should be lower then a 9.3" and go on to write what they really\u000athink, to you people I write this: you should vote it according to what\u000ayou think the movie should be, i.e. if you think the movie deserves an\u000a8 out of 10 then you should vote as such, I think this movie deserves a\u000a10 out of 10 and so I have given it as such.As for the movie, I can't tell you how incredible it is in my opinion,\u000ait is the only movie to date I could watch again and again, and not get\u000atired of watching it, the cast was spot on everything was perfect, the\u000asubjugation of the prisons by Captain Hadley, all of it was simply spot\u000aon, honestly speaking I don't know how people could watch this and fail\u000ato see how truly amazing it is, well deserving of its number 1 spot on\u000aIMDb.Also I read that people don't understand how Andy "pinned" the pictures\u000ato his wall, it could be either celotape or bluetac and as you see\u000aduring the movie, Andy works from under the poster when digging his\u000ahole so there is no plot hole of "how he put the poster back up after\u000aentering the hole" because the poster never gets taken down.\u000a

V\u000aThis suspense filled, dramatic movie rides high on the plain of self\u000adiscovery, self worth and self preservation; if an innocent man is\u000alocked up for two decades with criminals, nothing else will he learn\u000athan to be a criminal himself. There is no better movie that I can\u000arecommend you to see than this classic Jail Break that stared one of\u000athe best supporting actors you will love to have on your side if you\u000aare in the lead role of a movie, Morgan Freeman.Shawshank Redemption was adapted from a Stephen King novella named Rita\u000aHayworth and Shawshank Redemption. Frank Darabont secured the right to\u000amake the film from King in 1987, and he worked intensively on the\u000ascreenplay for a proper adaptation of the movie, Darabont's screenplay\u000awriting earned him an Academy Award nomination, in fact the movie had\u000aseven Academy Award nominations and won none.The film tells the story of Andy Dufresne (Tim Robbins) who is a banker\u000awho got convicted for murdering his wife and her lover; he got two\u000aconsecutive life sentences at Shawshank State Penitentiary. At\u000aShawshank Andy befriends a fellow inmate, Ellis Boyd "Red" Redding\u000a(Morgan Freeman) Red was a contraband smuggler.Andy also developed a nice rapport with the warden and the other guards\u000ahelping them with their taxes and also helping the warden in his money\u000alaundering operation.The movie boast of amazing scenery not to add an impressive\u000acinematography, the movie growth and inclusion and exit of characters\u000awill make you feel like you are reading a book, the movie has numerous\u000acast, and it is broken into segments each introducing new casts and\u000aeach building a parallel wall that guides us to the climatic end.It didn't do well in the box office at all barely making back its\u000aproduction cost, but due to critic's high rating and Academy Award\u000anomination, Golden Globe award nomination and other notable\u000anominations, the movie did well in rental and DVD sales, it is shown\u000aregularly on Cable TV, and it has a high following.Frank Darabont who is the director and screenplay writer also made more\u000aof King's books; He directed the 1999 Tom Hanks movie The Green Mile\u000awhich was a box office success compared to this. The Green Mile is\u000aanother of King's books that is about a prison, and Darabont also\u000adirected the 2007 movie The Mist which is also based on a Stephen King\u000abook.Here is a DVD every home should have.www.lagsreviews.com\u000a

V\u000a***WARNING: THIS REVIEW CONTAINS SPOILERS*** In 2007, the American Film\u000aInstitute released the 10th anniversary edition of their 100\u000aYears...100 Movies list. On this, "The Shawshank Redemption" was listed\u000aat #72. I find it insulting it was ranked so low."The Shawshank Redemption" is adapted by Frank Darabont from the\u000anovella "Rita Hayworth and Shawshank Redemption" by Stephen King. There\u000ahave been many adaptations of King's works (e.g., Stand By Me, Misery,\u000aThe Green Mile, etc.) but "The Shawshank Redemption" outshines them\u000aall. Why? Because it is nothing short of outstanding.For those of you who don't know what Shawshank is about, it concerns a\u000abanker named Andy Dufresne - played by Tim Robbins - who is wrongfully\u000aconvicted of murdering his philandering wife and her lover and\u000asentenced to life imprisonment at Shawshank State Penitentiary. He\u000abecomes close friends with Ellis Boyd "Red" Redding (Morgan Freeman),\u000athe film's narrator who has a reputation for being able to "get things"\u000afrom the outside world for the other prisoners. He and Andy become the\u000abest of friends as the years go by, during which time Andy's financial\u000aknowhow becomes an asset to the prison guards, particularly the corrupt\u000aWarden, who uses Andy as an accomplice in his money-laundering\u000aoperation.Shawshank explores themes of redemption and hope. Throughout his time\u000ain prison, Andy refuses to accept the hopelessness of his situation and\u000amaintains his integrity and self-worth, which ultimately pays off at\u000athe conclusion of the film. Likewise, Red finds redemption and solace\u000athrough his friendship with Andy, by performing acts of common decency\u000athat, in turn, build his own sense of integrity, self-worth and hope.It is these themes that do not make Shawshank a great film but an\u000aexcellent one. The visual style should be applauded, particularly Frank\u000aDarabont's direction and Roger Deakins' cinematography. While the\u000acharacters communicate and interact freely, they are nonetheless\u000atrapped within the confines of the prison, accurately captured by the\u000adark tone of the atmosphere that Deakins and Darabont create so well.The performances in this film are masterful. Tim Robbins' lead\u000aperformance as Andy Dufresne is skillful and nuanced. Each line is\u000adelivered flawlessly, his body language and subtle facial expressions\u000aare perfect in capturing the character's calm, laconic yet hopeful\u000ademeanour. His performance surely merited an Oscar nomination and\u000adeserved more recognition than it had from major award ceremonies.The performance of Morgan Freeman is also one to be noted. His\u000anarration is superb, and he never fails to connect with the audience.\u000aParticularly in the last quarter of the film, Freeman gives solid proof\u000aof why he is one of the finest actors alive.The Shawshank Redemption is arguably the best movie of all time and\u000adeserved more recognition than it had. Held in high regards by critics\u000aand viewers everywhere, it serves as a testament to Frank Darabont's\u000askill as a director and Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman's skills as\u000aactors. It is surely to go down as one of the modern classics of\u000afilmmaking and is up there with "The Godfather", "Citizen Kane",\u000a"Casablanca" and "Gone with the Wind." One of the greatest achievements\u000ain cinema in recent times.\u000a

V\u000aI'd never heard of "The Shawshank Redemption" when I tuned in to it\u000aabout 15 minutes in on one of my satellite channels, sometime around\u000a1997 or so.It mesmerized me, and the last 20 minutes astounded me. The twists, the\u000amusical score, the final scene. Amazing.I recall doing some searches (in those pre-Google days, probably with\u000aAlta Vista) to find out if anyone else had ever heard of this film. I\u000afound out that they had. It turns out a whole lot of people discovered\u000athis film as a "sleeper," on DVD or cable or satellite.My favorite movies of around that time, seen in theaters, had been\u000a"Pulp Fiction" and "Heat." I didn't see "Forrest Gump" until around\u000a2000 or so, and didn't care for it much. A good year for films.Given the comments in the past half year or so (that I've gone back\u000athrough), I suppose "Shawshank" will fall below some other films. There\u000aseems to be a a trend toward making "Hey, it's not all that!" (That is,\u000ait's not all that good, it's lousy, it's overrated, etc.)Whatever, it's a great film. And when I happened to see it late one\u000anight on my satellite system, I thought I was the first to realize how\u000agreat it was. It took several years for me to spot the high ratings on\u000aIMDb and to read that it had become a cult classic favorite.(Ditto for "The Big Lebowski," which for a while I thought I was the\u000aonly fan of. Now it's a subject of festivals and midnight watchings,\u000asort of like "Rocky Horror" once was. I saw "Rocky Horror" in 1976 at\u000athe World Science Fiction Convention in Kansas City and thought it was\u000anot very entertaining.)For me, the last 20-30 minutes is just the best. One twist after\u000aanother, all seamlessly done. And a compelling musical score.\u000aUnforgettable.\u000a

V\u000aThere are only a few movies that one will see in their lifetime that\u000aaffects the course of your life. I have loved The Shawshank Redemption\u000asince I first saw it, but only recently had its powerful effect shown\u000ato me. In short order I lost my father to illness, my wife to\u000aseparation, and my career to anger and dismay. Lost in depression,\u000amired in pain, and alone in a large house I watched it again. Between\u000aBrooks suffering, Red's hatred of hope, and Andy's response to his\u000afinal isolation, I stopped feeling alone. It is simple...get busy\u000aliving or get busy dying. This movie gave me the strength to start\u000aover. The movie is popular for many reasons, but it has a healing power\u000afor people trapped in their own Shawshank.\u000a

V\u000aLike a beautifully crafted French wine, this movie keeps getting better\u000aand better with every passing year. Every time I have viewed it over\u000athe past decade (and it must be at least more than 20 times by now), I\u000ahave found newer shades, subtler indications, and deeper meanings. And\u000ait has amazed me like very few have.* No overacting * Humour in the drab hopeless environs of Shawshank *\u000aMethod in the madness of running the scams from inside * The complete\u000asecrecy maintained for 20 years (not even Red knew!) * The best that a\u000ahighly-educated intellectual could do inside such a prison * What a\u000agreat actor the Warden turned out to be - totally despicable! * What a\u000abunch of speakable quotes.. what a bunch! * Totally recommended for any\u000ayoung person - students especially * HOPE TRULY IS THE BEST OF THINGS -\u000aa message that shines through\u000a

V\u000a2417th review!!!! Superb. Great. Masterpiece. Unforgettable. Excellent. Brilliant. No, no\u000a, no. I have been thinking for months to find a word that can describe\u000athe film. Nothing's found yet and , to be honest, I think nothing will\u000abe found forever. The movie can't be expressed by words. Words are\u000aunable to talk about it and I have nothing to say about this\u000amasterpiece. But I'm hopeful to be able one day to express my feelings\u000aabout it because "hope is a good thing, maybe the best of things, and\u000ano good thing ever dies" When it come to the Shawshank Redemption, I\u000aprefer to remain silent because "silence is full of unspoken words"\u000a

V\u000aI have grown up watching Bollywood movies, full of overacting by\u000aoverpaid, overfed 'heroes'. It was in college that i got to see some\u000afine Hollywood films and this one was probably the finest of the lot.\u000aThis film at first appears to be a story about life in prison. It fully\u000adescribes every small experience of a person serving a long prison\u000asentence. Life is not easy there for a lot of reasons. The screenplay\u000ais ably supported by Morgan Freeman's brilliant narration offering a\u000asecond-person view of life in shawshank. But Tim Robbins steals the\u000ashow by aptly underplaying the part of a wrongly sentenced, wealthy\u000abanker.The last forty minutes of this film, however, help raise it a\u000acouple of levels above other cinematic masterpieces. You don't need a\u000aweapon to fight. It is easy to take away a man's bread, even his\u000afreedom, but impossible to take away his hope.\u000a

V\u000aBelonging to the younger generation, I often wondered what all the fuss\u000aabout this movie was all about. I am a big fan of action movies, I\u000anormally do not watch movies that have a slow storyline. Inception , I\u000aalways thought, was my favourite. Then I one day decided to watch the\u000aShawshank Redemption. I was moved to the core of my heart. The movie\u000ainstantly became my all-time favourite. It proved to me that, no matter\u000ahow dark the tunnel may seem, there is always a light burning at the\u000aend of it. Its never too late to give up on hope. It keeps you burning\u000abright, in spite of the incessant and seemingly undeserved storms all\u000aaround you, till the time life may finally turn around for you. For if\u000ayour light is not burning till then, you will never make it to that\u000amoment. This is what this movie has taught me. If you are feeling down\u000aabout anything in your life, this is the movie you always wanted to\u000awatch.\u000a

V\u000aWhat to say about the "Shawshank Redemption"? I shouldn't really have\u000ato say anything because when most people hear about it, they already\u000ahave a pretty good idea of how incredible it is. This movie is freakin'\u000aimmaculate. Darabont and Co. have created not only the most inspiring\u000afilm in ages, but one of the most emotionally significant films to\u000adate. The movie teaches things to us that we need to know - messages on\u000ahope, perseverance, and friendship - and it does it with marvelous\u000aeloquency. All in all, "The Shawshank Redemption" remains one of the\u000amost spectacular films I have ever seen - a master piece of art.\u000aPerfect.\u000a

V\u000aDespair or determination; crying or fighting; obedience or inner\u000afreedom; resignation or patience; fear or hope...difficult choices in\u000alife make us all more powerful human beings. Experience makes us\u000aricher; hardship makes us stronger, friendship makes us better.\u000aAlthough we may be deprived of everything, only our own choices may\u000atruly deprive us of human dignity... These words ring the bell for the\u000amajority of people; yet, seldom do they appear so unique, so real and\u000aso concrete as in this wonderful film...Based on the novella by Stephen King RITA HAYWORTH AND SHAWSHANK\u000aREDEMPTION, the story appears to be unlike any other movie, unlike any\u000aother adaptation of Stephen King's stories onto screen, unlike most\u000aproductions of the world cinema. Why? I think that every viewer has to answer this question oneself. What I\u000aam going to do in this review is not look at why it is so powerful, why\u000ait is so unique but rather focus on a certain aspect that, in a way,\u000arefers to this question. What absorbed me to the very core of my\u000aemotions and feelings is the main plot of Andy (Tim Robbins), the\u000abanker wrongfully convicted of murdering his wife and her lover and\u000asentenced to Shawshank prison where brutality and wretchedness really\u000areign. At the spot where for many people, life actually ends, for Andy\u000aa new tedious struggle begins. Quickly befriended by "Red" (Morgan\u000aFreeman), actually the narrator of the story, both soon prove that even\u000ain the worst circumstances, within the "hell on earth" they can\u000amaintain human dignity and strive on their own way to freedom...Here, let me refer to Roger Ebert's words who nicely described the\u000acharacter of Andy: he says that "Andy turns out to be a surprise to\u000aeveryone in Shawshank, because within him is such a powerful reservoir\u000aof determination and strength that nothing seems to break him." Indeed,\u000asalvation lies within discipline for him...self-discipline...Except for some other plots, including the touching yet tragic story of\u000aTommy Williams (Gil Bellows) and of the sympathetic librarian Brooks\u000aHatlen (James Whitmore), it is Andy and Red who supply us with the most\u000aunforgettable moments in the movie. It is, as a matter of fact, the\u000astory of their friendship, their dreams expressed at the wall of\u000adespair. They maintain hope around themselves and within the viewers.\u000aHere, a very powerful aspect of Red is his narration...our thoughts are\u000adirected towards his thoughts, towards his reflections and his\u000aperception of the events, his - the prisoner's. Swear words take on\u000apower to convey meanings and harshness becomes reality. Here, it is\u000aimportant to mention the inevitable brutality in the film. Thanks to\u000athe fact it is perceived by Red, it never appears to be unendurable or\u000aharmful for the emotions of the viewer. We, as observers, truly know\u000awhat world we are led to...yet, there is no loss of hope!The unforgettable scenes seem to evoke the most powerful associations\u000aand expectations that lie within us concerning the visual and sensual\u000aexperience. With Thomas Newman's terrific music score consisting of\u000adark piano music, we are supplied with intense emotions and effective\u000athrill. Except for the symbolic and almost cult scene when Andy escapes\u000athe prison (mind you the almost claustrophobic effect), one cannot skip\u000a"The Letter Duet" scene when the excerpt of Mozart's "The Marriage of\u000aFigaro" is being played. The prison life stops for a while being\u000aawestruck by the glimpse of harmony, by the blissful moment of\u000amagnificence. At this moment, I was breathless and really second the\u000apowerful line: "Music makes you free!" The performances are awesome and the depiction of characters is\u000aexecuted in an extraordinary way. There are no clichés which is a great\u000amerit of the film and where many films of the genre fall into that\u000atrap. Although there were many actors who had been cast for the role of\u000aRed, I think that no one would have done the job as well as Morgan\u000aFreeman. He is perfect in the role combining a certain quality of\u000apatience and distance with the emotional struggle for personal rights.\u000aIronically, he portrays a re-socialized character...in fact, richer\u000ainside than any "corrupted decency." Tim Robbins also does a terrific\u000ajob as Andy with all his features mentioned before. And Bob Gunton as a\u000atrue villain, the boss of this hell of Shawshank will long remain in\u000amemory.To sum it up, I agree with short but meaningful words said by Roger\u000aEbert: "THE SHAWSHANK REDEMPTION is a movie about time, patience and\u000aharmony..." I would even add that it is the film about true life where\u000apeople are really themselves, to the most extent themselves. There,\u000awithin the harshest reality... Because only there, we truly behave\u000aaccording to our rules. There, we make choices even if everything that\u000asurrounds us seems to yell: "Salvation lies within blind discipline and\u000afundamental Bible!" A redemptive masterpiece, a masterful\u000aredemption...desperate Brooks was here...and so was Red...yet, he\u000abrought a new dawn for dreams, a new dawn for friendship... Will he\u000asucceed?\u000a

V\u000aI felt a sudden need to create an account on the web. Why? I do not\u000aknow. Having never written any movie review, I sometime wonder why I\u000afelt a need to use a regular Friday night doing so. But then I ask\u000amyself: Do there really have to be a purpose? Maybe not.The first time I watched The Shawshank Redemption were a couple of\u000ayears ago. I had looked up the evening's TV program and I stumbled\u000aacross the movie title. Not really expecting anything out from the\u000afilm's summary, I sat down on this evening and watched it. And did it\u000amove me. I was completely blown away by everything which the film\u000acontained: The acting, the environment, the music - and the story. The\u000aladder plays an important role in the movie. Why? Because in short, the\u000afilm is about a man who is wrongfully charged for murder, and the next\u000amany years in which he spends inside prison. But there is something\u000amore to it. The story is so well polished, constructed and so well\u000atold, that you wonder about what was done in the process of creating\u000athe movie, which could have made it so moving and so heart-touching.\u000aBecause really, it is all the details and the finesse of the movie,\u000awhich takes the film to a higher level than any other film which are\u000atold through storytelling.Throughout the 130 minutes of the film, you will be witness to\u000afantastic all around acting, particularly from Morgan Freeman who does\u000aa hell of a job working as the story teller. With the film starting out\u000aslowly, it smoothly starts to work towards the second half of the film,\u000awhere the film really starts to touch your soul. The ending of the\u000aShawshank Redemption is one of the best on film ever made, I dare say\u000athat.I could continue endlessly naming the goods of the film, but there is\u000asimply too much. In the end it is hard to point out what makes the\u000aShawshank Redemption so much better than everything else which you have\u000aever seen. My advice is: Buy the film and watch it - you will not be\u000adisappointed.I hope...\u000a

V\u000aTHE SHAWSHANK REDEMPTION is a kind of morality tale that is definitely\u000aone of Stephen King's more restrained kind of stories, dealing mostly\u000awith a character study of two individuals sharing imprisonment and the\u000aconsequences that await them when the tale ends.TIM ROBBINS is a man wrongly convicted of murder and serving a long\u000aprison term while MORGAN FREEMAN (who plays the narrator with great\u000adignity) describes himself as "the only guilty man in Shawshank." The\u000ahardships of prison life are captured in brief scenes that make the\u000aviewer wish that Robbins will find a way of escape. Along the way, he is gang raped by prisoners and treated harshly by a\u000abrutal warden and some of his spirit seems to vanish. But Robbins is\u000aquietly effective as a prisoner who makes a good adjustment when he\u000atakes charge of the prison library and sees to it that there's a wider\u000aselection of books than the kind of potboilers that King is noted for\u000awriting. A touch of irony here, no? The closing scenes are a bit of a\u000astretch and a reminder of just who wrote this prison tale--but still,\u000athey make an impact because of all that happens before.It's a bittersweet story, a sort of horrific fairy-tale of what might\u000ahave happened, but the viewer will be caught up in the story because of\u000athe tremendously skillful story-telling magic of Stephen King and\u000adirector Frank Darabont who also wrote the screenplay.\u000a

V\u000aThis film is a modern classic. Why? Because it simply includes\u000aeverything which builds a great story, and that is all films really\u000aare, storytelling.The concept of story telling can very easily be lost and forgotten in\u000aan industry that can sell cinema tickets by using special effects and\u000aemploying world super stars like Tom Cruise. That may well be the easy\u000aoption, but films that rely on pretty faces and big budgets will never\u000abe remembered. It is films like Shawshank that will lodge themselves\u000ainto people hearts, and will be passed down by many generations.This is because everyone that watches this film becomes a part of it.\u000aYou are there, in that prison, suffering when Andy does, smiling when\u000aAndy does. Tim Robbins plays this part so well it could be classed in\u000aone of the best lead parts in a film ever. He is simply superb. Plus,\u000aMorgan Freeman, well, would we expect anything less from a man with\u000asuch talent?It is this relationship, between Andy(Robbins) and Red(Freeman) which\u000areally strikes me as a breathe of fresh air, as if i had been hit in\u000athe face by a strong wind. We are trapped in a society where\u000arelationships only seem meaningful and deep when the two people\u000ainvolved are having sex. Hollywood have molded this preconception that\u000acharacters with a relationship must sleep together. Shawshank, for\u000aonce, tells the tale of two men, who by the end of the film have a very\u000astrong relationship, but have not gone down the Brokeback mountain road\u000aof madness. Their friendship is portrayed free of sex, yet is portrayed\u000aso powerfully that you are emotionally taken back by the ending.\u000aPersonally i nearly cried at a friendship so pure yet so meaningful.The plot is also perfectly timed. I am someone that is usually quite\u000acritical if the speed of a film moves too fast or if it drags on.\u000aShawshank gives you a mixture of paces, but also keeps the story\u000aturning and turning, as if it has a heart beat, pumping more and more\u000aof the story line, unwinding the plot before your open jaw.Another subject i would like to comment on is the swearing. Again, i am\u000anormally quite critical of films that have swearing in, just to look\u000acool, or higher the rating. Swearing in that context seems unnatural,\u000aand therefore disjointed. However the swearing in Shawshank seemed\u000atotally natural, and all part of the atmosphere of the prison.Finally, i think everyone should see this film. This is a pure, yet\u000athrilling tale of hope, friendship and belief. The story is executed\u000abrilliantly, with intense characteriztion from both sides of the\u000aspectrum- you become Andy, and go through his struggles with him, and\u000ayou hate the warden and his captain with a passion.I guarantee, by the time those credits gracefully slide up the screen,\u000ayou jaw will be open, your mind will be blown, and your heart will be\u000abroken into pieces. This is a truly unforgettable masterpiece.\u000a

V\u000aThe Shawshank Redemption is in a league with Casablanca as a movie you\u000acan watch over and over, catching different nuances each time and\u000abringing your own life experiences each time you watch it. Tim Robbins\u000agives the performance of his career and this is the movie for which\u000aMorgan Freeman should have won an Oscar (a shame he had to wait for\u000aMillion Dollar Baby.) There are many twists and turns and I defy anyone\u000ato watch the ending without tears running down their face. In fact, the\u000aentire last third of movie is filled with marvelous scenes. If there is\u000aany drawback to this movie, it is that it is a shade too long, meaning\u000ait's often butchered when it is shown with commercials on TV. Rent\u000athis, or better yet, buy it to get the full thrust of it. Definitely on\u000amy personal top 10.\u000a

V\u000a\u000aI use this movie in my Interpersonal Communication course.  The\u000arelationship\u000abetween Red and Andy provides rich examples for my students to look for as\u000athey write on important issues of Interpersonal Communication such as the\u000asymbolic nature of language, powerful and powerless speech, posture,\u000aintimate and social distances, territory, chronemics, various types of\u000alistening, and self disclosure.

V\u000a\u000aMy life is forever changed due to this movie.  It is a movie of hope,\u000a"redemption", and friendship.  It shows a deep growing friendship between\u000atwo prisoners, Andy and Red.  They each are shown growing through their\u000adistinct hardships at Shawshank prison.  As time passes, hope wanes but a\u000aflame burns bright in Andy.  His hope and unrelentless nature carry over to\u000ahis friend Red.As Red's long stay in prison comes to an end he sees the light at the\u000aend of the tunnel.  Andy has left it for him to see the way to freedom, and\u000ahe follows it.This film parallels my life and leaves me wondering if my advice will\u000ahelp somebody see the light.  For some of those people time will tell.  As\u000afor now I'll be patient to wait and see.  Don't end up like Brooks, there\u000awill always be someone to help you out.  There is someone out there that\u000acares for you.  Thank you Andy Dufresne, your hope is the flame of my life.\u000a\u000a

V\u000aAlong with Q and Pulp Fiction, Frank Darabont (The Walking Dead\u000aoriginal writer) and his debut film got screwed by the Hollywood\u000aPowerhouse that is Tom Hanks with this now can be considered an\u000aAmerican Classic. The fact that this film barely and I emphasize barely\u000amade it's money back in US theaters (which is usually a signal for a\u000afilm to turn into a DOA when released at home) and it made such a\u000asplash, that the film is exceeding what anyone thought a simple 18\u000ayears ago. This includes some of Hollywood's best critics including\u000aEW's Owen Gleiberman who originally gave the film a B- back in late\u000a'94. Yet over time, this story of redemption, like the rise of hope\u000athis film gives from beginning to end, grows on you to the point where\u000aat the very end, you have no choice but to clap (I clapped in my\u000abasement in front of my parents and I haven't looked the same since).\u000aDarabont found a formula that worked and it shows in his future films.\u000aHe made Robbins human, made Morgan Freeman's voice as American as a Big\u000aMac and made the late great Rita Hayworth relevant again. The only\u000aregret that one should have is the fact that if it was released two\u000ayears later it would've swept away the Oscars (Sorry Ralph Fiennes, The\u000aEnglish Patient won on a weak year.)\u000a

V\u000aI will always remember the night I watched this movie for the first\u000atime. I was 16-years-old and my dad and I were pretty bored late on a\u000aschool night. So naturally I say to my father, "Dad, I think it's time\u000ato watch Shawshank". I almost regret watching it. It is that good. It's\u000alike nothing I ever see in my lifetime can ever compare to the\u000aemotional roller coaster that 'The Shawshank Redemption' takes you on.First question I usually ask people when discussing films is, "So have\u000ayou seen Shawshank?". No matter what their reply is I am happy with the\u000aoutcome because if they say no, then they are yet to see the greatest\u000amovie of all time. If they say yes, I have something to talk to them\u000aabout for the next 27 minutes.You probably still won't believe me when I tell you that this is the\u000agreatest film you will ever see. It's that good that I actually told\u000aone of my friends not to watch it until she was on her deathbed. Then\u000ashe will see this movie without ever having to compare anything else to\u000ait. Now when I see a movie all I think is, I've already seen the best.Now actually getting onto maybe even reviewing this masterpiece (not\u000athat any summary of the plot could ever do it justice). So all I will\u000asay is this, I have never heard anyone give this movie a bad review. Do\u000ayourself a favour and don't even bother to finish reading this. Just go\u000aand watch it.\u000a

V\u000aTo tell the truth, I am speechless. I am a young movie fanatic, in\u000afact, this film came out the same year I was born, and therefore I am\u000amore used to films incredible special effects, edge-of-your-seat\u000aaction, et cetera. This film has none of that, and yet, it appeals so\u000aclosely to me. The way Frank Darabont uses the narration of Red to\u000adrive on the story, the beauty of the soundtrack used (note the\u000aharmonica used just before Red's finding of the letter close to the\u000aend). The entire film, from beginning to end, from actions to sound, is\u000aa beacon of hope, judgement, and redemption. The cast is perfect,\u000aMorgan Freeman(Red) actually brings about a refreshing feel to the\u000atale, and that is exactly what the movie is, what a movie should be.\u000aHighly recommended for every viewer, no matter your taste(or age-\u000a!judgement excludes use of language or violence!). I can't say it\u000adeserved its nO.1 position, i can't say any movie does, but if any\u000amovie should, this one might as well be it. *********\u000a

This is supposed to be a USER RATING , so if\u000ayou loved it , give it a 10 , if for you it is an average movie , give\u000ait a 5. I read some comments about this one , and heard someone saying : " ...\u000ait is a good movie, deserves 6 or 7 stars , but i gave it 1 star\u000abecause I think it is very overrated ...

V\u000aIt was the film that never seemed to have a break cut out for it.\u000aAdapted from a Steven King short story (usually a sure sign of\u000asuccess), yet a disappointment at the box office. Nominated for seven\u000aOscars, yet emerging with no wins. But, hope sprung eternal, and, as\u000alife began to imitate art, like its central characters, the film The\u000aShawshank Redemption overcame such initial adversity to become one of\u000athe most revered and cherished films of all time. Director/screenwriter Frank Darabont, working from Steven King's short\u000astory 'Rita Hayworth and the Shawshank Redemption' brings the tale to\u000alife in a superbly powerful and emotionally flooring fashion.\u000aDarabont's script executes the incredibly difficult task of speaking\u000adirectly to the human spirit, with its tale of passion and dedication\u000aovercoming captivity and adversity. Few modern films are bold enough to\u000atackle such shamelessly inspirational themes as Shawshank's without\u000acoming across as painfully clichéd, but Darabont's airtight script,\u000achock full of timeless lines, and steady, careful directing are enough\u000ato raise the film above such concerns, instead marking a film of which\u000athe emotional magnitude is seldom paralleled. From Roger Deakins'\u000asweeping, operatic cinematography, to Thomas Newman's truly beautiful\u000aand inspiring musical score, to the dank, gritty realism of Shawshank\u000aprison itself, the film's consistent quality on all fronts is truly\u000astunning. It is easy to see a story such as this easily falling flat with an\u000ainferior cast taking on the material, but Darabont's incredibly gifted\u000aand memorable cast is truly up to the challenge, taking a wonderful\u000astory and making it truly timeless. Tim Robbins truly brings\u000aunconventional convict Andy Dufresne to life, never without a\u000apassionate twinkle in his eye, even in his most beaten down and\u000ahopeless of scenes. Rather than typical leading man grandstanding,\u000aRobbins is wise enough to remain subtle and detached throughout, making\u000athe role all the more mysterious and endearing as a result. The\u000ainspired casting of Morgan Freeman as fellow inmate 'Red' resulted not\u000aonly in a series of sumptuous voiceovers by one of the most melodious\u000avoices in Hollywood, but also in a genuinely heartwarming supporting\u000acharacter, with Freeman building a career of playing similar 'wise\u000amentor figures' off his performance. The supporting cast being\u000acomprised mainly of relative unknowns strengthens the believability of\u000atheir characters, leading the audience to see them as their character\u000aand not as the star behind the role. Bob Gunton is chillingly effective\u000aas the hate-inspiring prison warden, infusing more menace into his\u000areedy voice and deadpan stare than any scenery chewing antagonist could\u000acapture. Character actor Clancy Brown also crafts another simple but\u000aeffective antagonistic role as the captain of the guards. Gil Bellows\u000ais a strong presence as a rebellious inmate, and James Whitmore is\u000acharming and lovable as aged prison librarian Brooks. Overall, The Shawshank Redemption is an astonishing accomplishment,\u000aaddressing shamelessly uplifting themes in a fashion which is\u000asentimental, but never sappy, larger than life, but never melodramatic.\u000aIn many ways the film feels like a throwback to the days of classic\u000acinema where directors strove to make films which made their audiences\u000ahappy, but Darabont easily dodges contemporary scorn by unabashedly and\u000ahonestly pitching the film towards the human spirit, and firmly\u000aestablishing it as a timeless classic with its impeccable package of\u000aflooring technical work, screen writing and acting. Far from being a\u000asimple "prison drama", the sheer emotional voyage of The Shawshank\u000aRedemption is enough to drain any viewer, both crushing their spirits\u000athen euphorically raising them in a truly peerless fashion. While Red\u000amay declare hope to be a dangerous thing, it's Darabont's fearless\u000atackling of the tricky subject which really sets Shawshank free. -10/10\u000a

V\u000ain my opinion ,it's better than the ordinary Monte Cristo story that we\u000aall know as the greatest escape tale , so this time the escape is\u000agreater! and the hero is an ordinary man , who is so patient and\u000ahopeful, while you watch the first few minutes of the film you may\u000athink that it's social or silly story, but minute by minute you will\u000arecognize that you were wrong, it's a Brilliant Story,a never seen\u000abefore , a very powerful drama .. the best thing in that movie was the\u000arelations between characters,like hating,and true friendship like the\u000aone which was between Tim Robins and Morgan Freeman,I like this movie and i advice every one on the planet to watch it as\u000asoon as possible....\u000a

V\u000aIn my opinion this is the one movie that is absolutely the greatest the\u000afirst time you watch it. It's probably my favorite movie. It may not\u000ahave the replay value of some of my other favorites but, the first time\u000ayou watch it when you don't know what is about to happen, is the\u000aprobably the greatest thing you can experience in terms of movies. I\u000aonly wish could I forget it so I could watch it again for the first\u000atime. As a matter of fact if I ever suffered complete amnesia there\u000awould be at least one definite benefit. I am not going to talk about\u000athe ending and for god's sake if anybody puts a spoiler warning on\u000atheir comments do not read them!\u000a

V\u000aI didn't see the film in the cinema, because I was too young at 14,\u000athough when I did rent it on video, and subsequently DVD, it was and is\u000astill to this day the best movie I have ever hired out, and Now I have\u000athe DVD with all the extras it makes a truly memorable film that much\u000acomplete. It's true what they say about this having an impact on\u000apeople's lives as it did me. From the moment it starts and you start to\u000ahear the narration of Morgan Freeman you know there is something\u000aspecial to this film.The films message of hope even in the most dark situations hope can be\u000aour salvation and it is so true. The film is put together perfectly\u000awhat brings the film together for me is Morgan Freemans voice it's so\u000apowerful, in his acting on screen in the film as well as his narration.There are two best scenes for me most powerful is Reds 3rd parole\u000ahearing it sums up total acceptance of what he's done and he can be\u000aopen to them about how he truly feels without a care or worry in the\u000aworld. The second is when Red finds the Box under the Oak Tree and the\u000awhole story seems to come together at that point. The way time\u000aprogresses is an essential aspect in this film and that's another\u000aexcellent example you see of Andy and the Warden almost becoming\u000apartners in crime and they develop this close bond. Prison Drama? No\u000athat description doesn't give this film justice it's a pure masterpiece\u000aand if you haven't seen it I would advise buy a copy now you won't be\u000adisappointed. Even after 50 or so viewings I still get a lump in\u000athroat.\u000a

V\u000aI knew about this movie for a long time.Heck, prison movies, don't turn me on so I have very negative\u000aimpression, hence not watching it. I watched it today (Oct 2005) as it\u000awas on TV, and I thought, it's got good rating, so I'll watch it, least\u000athis way I won't be watching it alone. Might as well get it over with.Well, any movie than can render a grown adult to tears and whirl up an\u000aemotional minefield, has to be respected. This movie has my utmost\u000arespect.This is truly a great film, even with all my negative baggage, and\u000aseeing clips, and reading people raving about it, I still avoided it.To render a grown man to cry even with all the baggage, has to be a\u000areally amazing film.This film transcends cinema, to what it's truly about - to move you. So\u000atechnically, it's pointless, you can go about actors, direction, shots,\u000amusic and so on, and to analyse this film purely on that level would be\u000aone very stupid mistake. A mistake many have used while writing\u000areviews.The book or film, is simply a mechanism to get a message across, it can\u000abe flawed and still work perfectly. That's not the point.The message here is clear and works perfectly, on many unconscious\u000alevels, it really would be stupid to try an figure it out.You can't as its so simple.We all have hope dreams and desires, and want freedom and a better\u000afuture. Every person does. It's actually why we exist.Not to have hope, dreams and desires and goals, is truly not to live.\u000aNot doing so, there is no meaning to life.No matter what happens, keep positive, have hopes dreams and desires,\u000athat is your purpose here on this planet this is what this film is\u000aabout, everything else is just mechanics to get this across?Are you Positive?Do you have hopes?Do you have dreams?Do you have goals?Have you helped your fellow man, just for the beauty and pleasure of\u000amaking someone happy, in a totally unselfish way, without any personal\u000again?If you haven't and don't have hopes, dreams, desires and goals, you are\u000anot alive, you have no meaning to your life.In conclusion, you can avoid this film as long as you want like I did,\u000abut when it does catch up with you... you better be ready, very ready.If you aren't or don't understand what you are watching, and what\u000areally is going on between the lines and mechanics of the imperfect\u000amechanism of cinema you are dead, truly dead, and you might as well end\u000ait now.So my advise to you?Don't Watch this film. If you've read this far, and not got what I've been going on about you\u000aare a lost cause already, and you might as well go into your miserable\u000alife, and causing misery to yourself and others. Heck, it'll take you\u000aseveral lifetimes probably to get it.So, remember DON'T WATCH THIS FILM, you don't deserve it.\u000a

V\u000a\u000aTo call The Shawshank Redemption a great film would be doing it no\u000ajustice\u000aat all. This is a film that when I watched it the first time I couldn't\u000abelieve how good it was.  I expected a film that would pass the time by,\u000aand\u000aI got a film that I could identify with.  If you are feeling sad, and\u000ayou\u000athink the world's a rubbish place, this fills you with hope.  I love the\u000aopening scene where the camera pans around the prison, and then the\u000amusic\u000akicks in, it makes you feel awe-inspired.  The acting was brilliant, you believed what everyone said (some films\u000athe\u000awords are delivered with such cheesiness and fake ness, that it makes\u000ayou\u000awant to throw up). I have watched Spiderman, and even the lines in that\u000amake\u000ayou feel that they mean nothing, they just sound good. The film and book reciprocated the message 'Hope Springs Eternal', which\u000ameans so much because we always live in hope that tomorrow it will be\u000abetter, things might change for us, and hope never dies. I think, when Tim Robbins speaks about music, how you can never take it\u000aaway, because it's in your head.  If I have a rubbish day at work, then\u000ait's\u000atrue that music just lifts you, which is re-emphasised with the scene\u000awhere\u000ahe plays the music full blast around the prison (this of example of\u000apiece of\u000ascript, which means, so much). The movie uses music to it's full\u000apotential\u000ato give more impact to the words and the characters.  This film cannot replicated, because the film is a piece of art, the\u000aDirector wanted to make money, but he also wanted to make a piece of\u000afilm\u000athat made you feel something, that had some effect on you after the\u000amovie\u000awas over. The movie has no bad points it's what a story should be about,\u000ait\u000atakes you somewhere that you nether been, and makes you feel you lived\u000athat\u000aexperience, and you can learn from that experience.  The lines\u000adelivered,\u000awill always be remembered 'Get busy living, or get busy dying' (this is\u000athe\u000adilemma we face in everyday live).  This will live in my memories\u000aforever,\u000anot like the sorry cash-ins of movies.  This is a brief synopsis of how great the movie is, but words just seem\u000aso\u000alittle to explain the brilliance of this film.\u000a

V\u000a\u000aMy favorite movie ever.  These are words that basically describe how I feel\u000a about this movie.  A prison drama does not sound like an entertaining movie,\u000a but this is very entertaining.  Tim Robbins (The Player, I.Q.) stars as\u000a Andy Dufresne a smart man convicted of killing his wife and her lover.  He\u000a arrives at Shawshank prison completely out of place, but adapts and becomes\u000a best friends with one of the prison's head convicts, wonderfully played by\u000a Morgan Freeman (Driving Miss Daisy, Seven).  Soon the warden, played by Bob\u000a Gunton (Midnight in the Garden of Good and Evil, Broken Arrow), enlists his\u000a help as a banker, to help with getting some extra (illegal) money and other\u000a things.  It doesn't sound like a great movie, but trust me this is the best\u000a movie I've ever seen, and everyone I know liked it.  Tim Robbins is great\u000a in the lead.  Bob Gunton is good as the twisted warden.  William Sadler \u000a(Solo, Die Hard 2) is solid as a fellow convict.  Clancy Brown (Starship\u000a Troopers, Highlander) is excellent as the sadistic head of the guards. \u000a Finally, James Whitmore (The Relic) and Gil Bellows (Snow White: A tale of\u000a terror) give the best supporting performances as fellow convicts.  A must\u000a see. \u000a

V\u000aI have seen The Shawshank Redemption twice now, the second time being\u000aabout a week ago. After the first time I saw it, I gave it a perfect 10\u000arating on IMDb, something I do very rarely (I've given out 20 ratings\u000aof 10 out of the 600+ movies I've rated). However, after just one\u000aviewing, I felt so impacted by this film that it immediately rocketed\u000anear the top of my favorite movie list. After a second viewing, I feel\u000aeven more amazed by it than I was the first time I saw it. The movie captures your interest in the first scene and unfolds new\u000aplot points and character developments slowly at first and then more\u000arapidly as the movie goes on. The movie runs about 130 minutes long,\u000abut it never gets boring. While it is admittedly slow paced, this only\u000aserves into its greatness. It allows the viewer to get to know the\u000acharacters of Andy and Red and sympathize with them; along the way, we\u000aalso get to know and grow attached to the other prisoners trapped\u000ainside Shawshank. The movie flows perfectly from one scene to the next,\u000anever feeling forced or losing your interest. The movie is mostly\u000adialogue driven, but there are some violent scenes which help convey\u000athe brutality of prison life.Finally, the final 30 minutes are perhaps the most satisfying in any\u000amovie. I do not want to spoil the ending for those who have never seen\u000ait, but suffice to say, the final act of the movie leaves you floored.\u000aBoth times that I saw it, I was rooted to my seat long after the\u000acredits rolled, just thinking about the brilliance of the ending and\u000athe entire movie as a whole. Forrest Gump and Pulp Fiction are both\u000agreat movies, highly entertaining. I particularly love Pulp Fiction;\u000ahowever, it is a travesty that The Shawshank Redemption did not win\u000aBest Picture. It was certainly the best film of the year in my opinion,\u000aarguably the best film of the decade, and perhaps one of the finest\u000amovies ever made. The even bigger tragedy, though, is that while Morgan\u000aFreeman earned an Oscar nomination for his great performance, Tim\u000aRobbins' turn as Andy Dufresne went without a nomination. Robbins\u000acarries the film, and his performance is truly one of the greatest I\u000ahave ever seen. The bottom line is that The Shawshank Redmption is a perfect movie. It\u000atakes you in from the opening scene and doesn't let you go until long\u000aafter it comes to a tremendous close. Along the way, it will make you\u000athink, fear, wonder, and feel a number of other emotions. If you have\u000anot seen this movie, waste no time; go rent it today and see why this\u000ais the highest ranked film on IMDb.\u000a

V\u000aThe Shawshank Redemption came out in 1994 and was an absolute flop but\u000afound its real audience in home video, peaking as the most rented video\u000aof 1995 in the USA. A wonderful film that takes you into the prison experience of\u000aRed(Morgan Freeman) and Andy (Tim Robbins). Andy being a banker\u000aconvicted of murder and Red a murderer already serving time, this movie\u000atakes you to the limits of human endurance, where the human spirit\u000aeventually prevails. The TSR takes you on an emotional journey that you will remember for a\u000along time, thanks to the superb crafting of the film and sincere\u000aperformances by the cast. The score is deep and haunting, this film is\u000afor the ages and will permenantly have a place in my heart. To me it is\u000athe best film of the 90's and quite possibly one of the best of all\u000atime.The fact that this film is sitting at No.2 is a testament to just how\u000amany people love this film, many viewers seem to have an emotional bond\u000awith the film, and I don't blame them. I only wish that I could view\u000athe film for the first time again, and experience that redeeming\u000afeeling Andy and Red experienced at the end.Ignore the hype surrounding the film and judge it on your own\u000aexperience, the last half hour are especially beautiful. Watch this if\u000ayou already haven't, and enjoy the masterpiece that Frank Darabont has\u000aso gracefully given us the privilege of viewing. 10/10\u000a

The film will keep you glued to your\u000aseat if you know what it means.It will bring tears to your eyes. It\u000awill make you think how you have lived your life so far...or in fact\u000ahow you have wasted it. It will teach you the value of freedom which we\u000aenjoy without giving a second thought. And it will leave you with a\u000asense of happiness which you will experience only rarely. The\u000aperformances are simply mind boggling, be it Tim Robbins or Morgan\u000aFreeman or countless others. And it is difficult to believe this was\u000athe debut of Frank Darabont as a director.If you haven't already seen\u000ait... please do, otherwise you are missing something.\u000a

V\u000aShawshank Redemption, The (1994) **** (out of 4) An innocent man (Tim Robbins) is sent to prison on murder charges and\u000aonce there he bonds with another man (Morgan Freeman) serving a life\u000asentence. I remember seeing this when it was first released to theaters\u000aand walking out thinking it was a masterpiece but apparently others\u000acouldn't be bothered to see it since the box office results were very\u000alow and it was out of theaters in no time. Over the years the\u000areputation of this film has grown and as I write this it's currently #1\u000aat IMDb. I certainly wouldn't call this the greatest film ever made but\u000ait's certainly one of them. I think it's an insult to call this a\u000aprison movie because it's so much more than that. This is a film about\u000afriendship and hope. Those are two things that have played major parts\u000ain many movies but I can't think of too many films where the payoff is\u000aas large. What makes the film work so well is that director Durabont\u000atakes his time telling a story that takes place over twenty years.\u000aAnother wonderful thing the director does is that he really makes the\u000atwenty years pass on a believable manor. Most films that jump time feel\u000acheap and rushed but that's not the case here because the wonderful\u000ascreenplay lets us get to know the two main character but also the\u000asupporting characters are very well written. What really brings this\u000amagic to life are the performances, which are downright brilliant and\u000aI'd argue that you can see some of the greatest ensemble acting right\u000ain this film. Robbins and Freeman are terrific together and really make\u000afor one of the most memorable friendships in movie history. The way\u000aRobbins walks and talks is perfectly done and I just love the way, as\u000aFreeman says in his narration, he walks around as if he didn't have a\u000acare in the world. Freeman gives another wonderful performance but\u000awhat's really great about him is the narration he adds as he tells us\u000athe story. James Whitmore is terrific as the elderly convict and Clancy\u000aBrown and Bob Gunton make for excellent villains. I won't spoil the\u000aending for anyone but the final twenty-minutes are at times\u000abreathtaking in their beauty and it's message of hope rings louder than\u000amost movies.\u000a

V\u000a\u000aA film about a Stephen King story? Directed by Frank Darabont.  .  .  Who? \u000a Starring Tim Robbins.  .  .  Wasn't he the guy from Howard the Duck?  I\u000a admit, only the sublime acting talents of Morgan Freeman took me along to\u000a see this movie.  Now the only questions I have to ask are:  Why didn't\u000a EVERYBODY go to see this movie?  and, Why didn't Morgan Freeman win the\u000a Oscar?  Tom Hanks is a fine actor but, he should never have beaten Morgan. \u000a Once again a Stephen King short story translates to film better than his\u000a horror opus'.  Tim Robbins pulls out his finest performance to date, and,\u000a Mr Darabont take a bow.  Very rarely are you left with a large smile and\u000a warm heart at the end of a movie but, I could have danced as the camera\u000a slowly panned back from the beach.  .  .  Perfect.\u000a

V\u000aIn this review I'm not going to give a plot synopsis of this film\u000abecause I'm sure everybody else who has commented on it has. However, I\u000awill express the positive effect it can have on the viewer if they let\u000ait.The acting is uncommonly magnificent. Morgan Freeman delivers the\u000agreatest performance of his brilliant career as the seasoned\u000alife-serving prisoner Ellis Boyd "Red" Redding, Tim Robbins holds his\u000aown against Freeman as Andy, the central character, James Whitmore's\u000aportrayal of the institutionalized Brooks provides the backbone of the\u000astory, Bob Gunton is wonderful as the corrupt Warden Norton, and Clancy\u000aBrown's commanding performance as Captain Hadley, the sadistic head\u000aprison guard, almost makes him steal the show from Freeman.Frank Darabont's restrained direction of the delicate story is critical\u000afor the film to not become sentimental or clichéd, and his beautiful\u000aadaptation of the Stephen King story on which the movie is based is a\u000areal breath of fresh air. On account of Darabont, the film shows that\u000aspecial effects are not needed to tell a great story in film. As a\u000a17-year-old male, I love special effects movies as much as the next\u000aperson, but they get boring after a while. Plus many people forget that\u000athere was a time in cinema when the blockbuster didn't exist, when they\u000amade movies that just told great stories and gave the audience a chance\u000ato be uplifted by those stories without the creators having to resort\u000ato special effects. I applaud you for having the guts to make a\u000anon-commercial film that reminds people of that in this day and age,\u000aMr. Darabont.SPOILER ALERT! As with all truly great films, 'The Shawshank Redemption' is full of\u000ascenes that have become entrenched in the public's collective\u000aconsciousness. There's the scene where Andy plays the opera record over\u000athe loudspeaker for all the inmates in the prison, Captain Hadley\u000abashing "Fat @$$" to death for crying during his first night in prison\u000a(a very powerful scene), Red giving his "Rehabilitated?" speech to the\u000aboard of parole officials, the Warden getting his final judgement, and\u000aof course, Andy crawling to freedom through what Red in his narration\u000acalls "500 yards of s**t-smelling foulness I can't even imagine,", the\u000ascene which for me is perhaps the greatest movie scene of the '90s.END OF SPOILERS! I thoroughly recommend this cinematic masterpiece, which has earned its\u000aplace in my humble top ten films of all time list, to anybody. Whatever\u000agender, age, religion, nationality etc. you are and whatever language\u000ayou speak, I guarantee it will change your life, or perhaps even save\u000ait. Movies like 'The Shawshank Redemption' only come along once every\u000adecade, if that. Unforgettable.10/10.\u000a

V\u000a\u000aDeliberately (some might even say slowly in places) paced, "The Shawshank\u000aRedemption" alternates between offering a grittily realistic portrayal of\u000alife in prison and flights of fancy that make the story too unbelievable to\u000areally be accepted. There is an interesting subplot (which doesn't take up\u000amuch of the movie but which does make the viewer ponder) about the\u000adifficulties of adjusting to life in the real world after extended periods\u000aof incarceration. The performances from the two leads are excellent. Morgan Freeman puts on\u000ahis usual outstanding performance as "Red" - the wise old con through whose\u000aeyes the story is told, and Tim Robbins as Andy Dufresnce, a young banker\u000awrongly convicted of murdering his wife and her lover who has to adjust to\u000athe nightmare of prison life. Among the supporting cast I was impressed with\u000aBob Gunton as the Bible-spouting but corrupt Warden Norton, who uses Andy's\u000afinancial expertise to enrich himself, and James Whitmore as Brooks,\u000aimprisoned for fifty years and terrified when he is finally granted parole\u000aand who, unable to adjust to life on the outside, yearns only to be back in\u000athe only home he ever knew - prison. It's an interesting twist - experience\u000aalso by Red later on in the movie - that freedom can seem to be like a\u000aprison for those so accustomed to the regimentation of life in an\u000ainstitution.While the movie is impressive and engrossing all the way through, though,\u000athere are some weaknesses to the story that bothered me a bit. (There are\u000asome spoilers ahead.)I found it difficult to imagine prison guards from all over the State of\u000aMaine bringing their tax returns to Andy. It just didn't seem to me like\u000asomething that would have happened. It also struck me as unlikely that a\u000aletter-writing campaign from one solitary prisoner (even one that lasted six\u000ayears, one letter a week) would have convinced the State to fund the\u000aimprovements Andy got for the prison library. I would rather expect that\u000aafter a while the letters would simply start to be discarded. Andy's escape\u000aalso bothered me. It was too "easy" - even though it took twenty years. And\u000ahow did he keep that suit so spotless and unwrinkled while crawling through\u000athat dirty sewer? Mind you, the moments leading up to the discovery of his\u000aescape were among the most dramatic in the movie. The very end of the story\u000awas also clearly telegraphed some time before.Frankly speaking, I think "The Shawshank Redemption" is a bit over-rated\u000ahere at IMDb, being ranked the second best movie of all time, but this is\u000astill a very, very good movie, and an excellent portrayal (through Andy) of\u000athe survival of the human spirit in even the toughest times. Personally, I\u000agive it a 7/10.\u000a

V\u000aTim Robbins plays Andy Dufresne, a man convicted of double murder who\u000ais sent to jail, eventually befriending other lifers including Morgan\u000aFreeman's Ellis Redding. Exceptionally handsome adaptation of Stephen\u000aKing's short story "Rita Hayworth and Shawshank Redemption" (in the\u000afilm version, it's really Raquel Welch, not Rita, who aids in the\u000aultimate twist). On the surface, it's another prison-genre picture with\u000athe usual stereotypes such as a rotten warden, a cruel guard, a few\u000ahomosexuals, and a quirky old-timer who doesn't want his parole.\u000aHowever, the film's emotions run surprisingly deep, justice is well\u000aserved by the conclusion, and several of the cast members carve out\u000aamazing, three-dimensional characterizations. The finale is pure\u000afantasy, however it does provide the audience with the release it\u000aneeds, and Robbins and Freeman are excellent. Long, involved, but\u000aengrossing and satisfying, "Shawshank" was not a big hit at the\u000abox-office but found a devoted following on video and cable. **1/2 from\u000a****\u000a

V\u000a\u000aAndy Defresne is a young banker who goes to pieces when he learns his wife\u000ais being unfaithful.  He gets drunk and wakes in his car, where he is\u000apicked\u000aup for the murder of his wife and her lover.  Despite his pleas of\u000ainnocence, Andy is sentenced to life in prison where he is immediately\u000aintroduced to the horrors of live inside.  Fellow lifer, Red, tells Andy's\u000astory of how he held hope and managed to use his banking skills to improve\u000athe conditions for himself and others.I saw this film in the cinema when it came out and, looking back, it is\u000asurprising how little fuss was made over it at the time - I was one of 15\u000aor\u000a20 people in the cinema when I saw it (on it's second week out!).  However\u000atime has brought it to the top of many popular lists of films and it is\u000amainly due to a story that is based around friendship and hope that\u000aengages\u000aand eventually uplifts.If you are going to adapt a Stephen King book, the lesson from this film\u000aand\u000aothers appears to be to adapt a short one.  Here the story is set up well\u000awith all the usual stuff that we expect from prison dramas, but with the\u000akey\u000adifference that these events are not the film - no the film is about Andy\u000aand Red's friendship.  These two men are great characters and I was very\u000aeasily drawn into their story.  It is witty, dark and yet enjoyable all at\u000athe same time.  It is impossible not to be affected by the ending and this\u000asimple uplifting sentiment is part of the reason it has been taken in by\u000aso\u000amany viewers as one of their favourites.Of course it is a little long at times and for my personal tastes it is a\u000alittle too sentimental at times although this is to be expected with any\u000aHollywood film.  The slightly sentimental view of the prison also goes so\u000afar to ignore the idea that there would be any homosexual relationship\u000athat\u000aaren't rape and even ruling out any suggestion of racism - there is no\u000atension or segregation in evidence here.  I won't do spoilers but the\u000aending\u000awas too clear for me where leaving us with more questions would have been\u000amore in holding with the idea of hope that the film had traded in prior to\u000athis.  The characters work well due to some great performances.  Robbins\u000ais\u000agreat as Andy and he ages and grows well - whether or not he is believable\u000ain his calm approach to the punishment he takes is another matter, but I\u000awas\u000acaught up in the film enough to get past that.  Freeman may not be the\u000aIrish\u000aguy from the book (hence the name Red) but he is excellent as the father\u000afigure - even if he appears to age very slowly in comparison to Andy.  The\u000achemistry between the two is the key and it really works.Of course having a support cast that includes a great number of fine\u000asupport\u000aactors probably helped.  People like Gunton, Sadler, Bellows and others\u000amay\u000anot always be great but here they fit the bill. Yes the characters tend to\u000abe very clichéd (the bird man, the rapists etc) but again that comes with\u000athe genre and I was able to get past these by focusing on the main\u000arelationship.  The surprise performance for me was from Clancy Brown - not\u000athe most subtle of actors (Highlander is his other famous role) but he is\u000avery good here indeed, albeit with little actual character depth.  As\u000adirector Darabont has done very well, framing some great shots (that crane\u000ashot as the bus arrives for the first time) as well as a shot that has\u000abecome almost iconic.  He is helped by a score that fits the sweeping\u000asense\u000aof hope that the film brings.Overall this is an imperfect film and it is flattered by it regular high\u000aappearance on the popular `best film' lists.  However it is also a great\u000alittle story that twists and turns as it is told, it has all the clichés\u000aof\u000athe genre but at it's heart it is based on friendship and a sense of hope\u000athat it is hard not to find uplifting.  For all it's faults it is a\u000apopular\u000aand moving story that seems to do the trick for the majority of those that\u000asee it.\u000a

V\u000aWhat can I possibly add to a review corpus of over 1.2 million ratings\u000aand three thousand reviews? This movie has been called "one of the best\u000amovies of all time", "a powerful story about friendship, hope and\u000afreedom" and a "latter-day retelling of the Gospel story". Many people\u000ahave seen this movie multiple times, and some claim it has changed\u000atheir lives and even saved their lives.At this point, I'm rather more interested in the phenomenon than the\u000amovie. My take on it: this movie appeals enormously to ordinary people\u000a(especially American men) who feel trapped by difficult situations in\u000atheir lives. Some may be looking to be rescued, like Red was; others\u000amay take comfort in the thought that their long-term pain, tedium and\u000aoppression will someday result in a spectacular liberating event. This\u000amovie satisfyingly scratches that annoying itch called "life is\u000aunfair".It's difficult to know what to think about all this. Whatever you think\u000aabout the phenomenon, "Shawshank Redemption" is also just a good movie\u000awith excellent writing, black and white characters, a simple but\u000asatisfying plot with a few surprising scenes, great acting, and a\u000acertain amount of tear jerking. It's not a movie to be missed.\u000a

V\u000aAn amazing movie. Easily one of the best movies made during the 90s and\u000adefinitely one of the top "prison" movies of all-time. Pretty much\u000aeverything about this movie works and works extremely well! The film\u000atouches upon many subjects, including the ideas of hope, redemption,\u000alove, loneliness, justice, life/death, friendship, endurance, fear,\u000apatience, inspiration and so much more. Watching this movie always makes me feel a million times better, and if\u000athat's not the greatest reason to watch a film, I don't know what is.\u000aGive it up to both Freeman and Robbins for completely engulfing their\u000acharacters with heart, soul and the spirit of humanity. I appreciated\u000athe message in this film, I absolutely loved the way it ended, I\u000asurrendered to its pace, I enjoyed all of its characters, I thought it\u000awas wonderfully photographed, I loved the score and I could seriously\u000awatch this movie 10 times a year and not bat an eyelash the whole way\u000athrough. Love it, watch it, get your own motivation from it and surrender to its\u000aspirit which gives anyone in the world hope to do whatever they dream\u000ato do in life...\u000a

V\u000aAnd one of the saddest in the world! Andy really had a hard time of it.\u000aThis is one of those films where I always wonder if I got stuck in jail\u000awhat would my life be like? What exactly would I do? How would I live\u000aand how exactly would I survive. The only current TV show that brings\u000aback those emotions is Orange is the New Black. Feeling isolated and\u000astuck.The breath of this film can be summed up in a few ways but most of the\u000ahuman spirit and the will to survive against all odds. Hope is the\u000aanswer and name of the game in this film. Trying to control your\u000asurroundings even though control is the least you have.\u000a

Morgan Freeman\u000aimposes a classic character that is recognizable in his other roles,\u000abut clearly deserves the most praise due to the immense hype over this\u000afilm.

V\u000aOne of the last places you would expect to see a movie about hope and\u000athe deep bonds of friendship takes place in a prison. This drama is a\u000aworthy top 100 film, and I believe that is where it will stay for many\u000ayears to come. There is a fair amount of explicit language throughout\u000athe movie, so for those that cannot tolerate language, this may ruin\u000athe redeeming qualities of the movie for you.One quality I look for in a good movie is to get lost in the film, to\u000athe point that I begin to feel the emotions of characters. Here you\u000awill find a bit of everything, hopelessness, hope, love, and anger. Put\u000ait this way, if I had only three movies to pick to watch the rest of my\u000alife, this would be one. If there was a reading rainbow list for\u000amovies, then I would highly suggest you pick up a copy and watch this\u000amovie. Hope you enjoy\u000a

V\u000aPrison is a gloomy and dark place that can contain beauty if worked on.\u000aFriendships can be formed, enjoyment can be experienced, and freedom\u000acan sometimes be felt. "The Shawshank Redemption" is a very popular\u000afilm that contains world class film-making and interesting life-lessons\u000athat can be applied from prison to the free world. Tim Robbins stars as\u000aAndy Dufresne, a banker who is convicted of murdering his wife, a crime\u000ahe didn't commit. After being sent to the Shawshank State Penitentiary\u000ain Maine, Andy encounters some tough people including a brutal prison\u000aguard and ruthless prisoners and lives in constant fear. Andy soon\u000ameets Red, a contraband smuggler with a life sentence played by Morgan\u000aFreeman in the greatest performance of his life. The two form a special\u000afriendship and find how to make the best of their situation. As the men\u000aget different jobs in the prison, attempt escape, and experience\u000adifferent feelings, the men try to redeem this depressing prison and\u000afind a better life. This story is an absolute cinematic icon and there\u000ais no questioning as to why this is a classic work of art. The\u000afriendship formed between Andy and Red is one of the most fascinating\u000athings to watch form in cinema, as we get elaborate character\u000adevelopment and watch the unfolding of a beautiful friendship come to\u000alife in a depressing location. The extra tad's such as the use of\u000aforeshadowing and flashbacks writer Frank Darabont uses creative detail\u000aand complexity to make this story special. Darabont also directs this\u000afilm and portrays a prison life in shockingly unique ways. He focuses\u000aon all the hardships that make prison seem nightmarish, but also shows\u000ahow prison can be the best place on earth when you have a friend and\u000aenjoyment in difficult situations. The themes of persistence and hope\u000athat are brought up in this film can relate to anyone's situation\u000awhether free or in prison. Darabont adapts Stephen King's story to show\u000aus how in order to live we need freedom, and without hope you will\u000anever achieve it. This is a classic example of pure 90's film-making\u000aand stands as one of the best classics of all time. "The Shawshank\u000aRedemption" is one of the greatest narrative stories ever told and\u000abrings so much up that can inspire the world on how to achieve meaning\u000ain life.\u000a

The story\u000abegins with the trial of a young banker, Andy Dufrense, victimized by\u000acircumstantial evidence, resulting in a conviction for the murder of\u000ahis wife and her lover. After a quick conviction, Andy finds himself\u000aserving a life sentence at Shawshank prison, with no hope of parole. He\u000aexists in this prison only in appearance, keeping his mind free from\u000athe drab walls around him. His ability to do this results in the\u000againing of respect from his fellow inmates, but most of all from Ellis\u000aRedding.

Andy got sentenced to prison for\u000asupposedly murdering his wife and her lover, but it is not true. So, he\u000agot sentenced to 2 life sentences in Shawshank prison and meets Red,\u000awho is also serving a life sentence. They grow to become pals and learn\u000aa lot from each other. Andy eventually breaks out and it is just a\u000afantastic moment in cinema. This is based on Stephen King's short\u000anovella "Rita Hayworth and The Shawshank Redemption" which I NEED to\u000aread now. I highly recommend this masterpiece to anyone who loves good\u000amovies!!\u000a

V\u000aI love this movie. It truly is one of the greatest movies I've ever\u000aseen. A timeless classic. It gets the full 10 from me. It sends us\u000anumerous messages and has hidden meanings. Its so beautifully laid out\u000aand filmed. It teaches us a lot about ex convicts also. Yes, they may\u000ahave did wrong to go to prison but some can't handle the outside world\u000athe way they used to. It has all the emotions embedded in it. Funny,\u000asad, happy, deep all of those emotions and more. I would definitely\u000arecommend this movie to everybody I meet. Its beautifully shot to\u000acapture the essences of every character and their feelings and\u000aemotions. The writing is spectacular. As a writer myself I like to look\u000aat the writing and acting. I'm also an actress so those are the two\u000aqualities I focus on. The story line is extremely important. If it\u000adoesn't make sense then it ruins the movie completely. The acting in\u000athis was sensational. The storyline was genius. Definitely worth the\u000afull 10 out of 10 rating that I am giving it.\u000a

V\u000aThe Shawshank Redemption is a movie that shows courage, patience, and\u000adetermination. We sometimes see some things as impossible, but with\u000apersistence and determination, we can achieve something. The story of\u000athe movie is really shocking. We may find it boring on the early part\u000abut you would just surprise on the turn of events as the movie plays\u000athrough. You will really would not believe that a certain person could\u000amake a hole so long that you can make a way out. I can't still imagine\u000ahow the main character made it. Well in life nothing is impossible as\u000along as we want it happen. We must only believe of what we can do so we\u000acan be productive and successful. This movie is really worth watching.\u000aYou may find it boring on the early part, don't be bothered, finish it,\u000asurely you will enjoy.\u000a

V\u000aDarabont constructs the film to observe the story, not to punch it up\u000aor upstage it. Upstaging, in fact, is unknown in this film; the actors\u000aare content to stay within their roles, the story moves in an orderly\u000away, and the film itself reflects the slow passage of the decades.\u000a"When they put you in that cell," Red says, "when those bars slam home,\u000athat's when you know it's for real. Old life blown away in the blink of\u000aan eye. Nothing left but all the time in the world to think about it."\u000aWatching the film again, I admired it even more than the first time I\u000asaw it. Affection for good films often grows with familiarity, as it\u000adoes with music. Some have said life is a prison, we are Red, Andy is\u000aour redeemer. All good art is about something deeper than it admits.\u000a

V\u000aAwesome movie. Loved loved loved it. I love everybody in the movie.\u000aThis is my all time favorite movie. I loved morgan freeman in it. It\u000areally showed how life can be when u get locked up. Then it also shows\u000awhat happens to the men who have been locked up for a long time. They\u000adon't know anything or anybody else besides the people and guards they\u000awas locked up with. I liked how they put a different spin and view on\u000ait.They let people see how things use to go on in the jail from a very\u000avery very long time ago and how men didn't want to leave because jail\u000awas all they knew. they didn't know much about the outside because it\u000ahad changed so much. If i was them i don't think i would want to leave\u000aeither. i loved the movie. i bought it and i watch it everyday.\u000a

V\u000aPain, death, love and hate have never been personified the beautifully\u000aon screen. Storyline, story-arc and character-arc are alive and well in\u000athe creative light of this picture. A welcomed reminder of good\u000atriumphing over not just evil, but the time good needs to find it's\u000afoundation, grow, live and learn under evils presences to survive.\u000aQuoting fellow IMDb member Tim Cox "One of the finest films made in\u000arecent years. It's a poignant story about hope. Hope gets me. That's\u000awhat makes a film like this more than a movie. It tells a lesson about\u000alife. Those are the films people talk about 50 or even 100 years from\u000ayou. It's also a story for freedom. Freedom from isolation, from rule,\u000afrom bigotry and hate. Freeman and Robbins are majestic in their\u000aperformances. Each learns from the other. Their relationship is strong\u000aand you feel that from the first moment they make contact with one\u000aanother. There is also a wonderful performance from legend James\u000aWhitmore as Brooks."\u000a

V\u000aThe film's been IMDb's #1 for as long as I can remember. That doesn't\u000areally raise my expectations, considering I don't agree with so many\u000ainclusions or exclusions. I thought this was absolutely fantastic. Yes,\u000ait's pretty sentimental in a big way, but unlike that year's Best\u000aPicture winner, it tells a captivating, simple yet intriguing story\u000athat manages to earn its emotion with some really heartfelt characters\u000aand superb writing. It's hard to hold anything against it (if you liked\u000ait, of course) when it's so unpretentious and gentle. Freeman is\u000afantastic, unsurprisingly, but Tim Robbins is so bloody brilliant in\u000athis. Watching Rectify now, Aiden Young seems to be playing in the same\u000aballpark in terms of the similarity in his portrayal.\u000a

V\u000a1994 was the year I was born. 20 years later I watched The Shawshank\u000aRedemption and do not regret it. It is truly one of the best movies of\u000aall time. I personally wouldn't put it as #1 in IMDb's top 250 list.\u000aThere are a ton of movies that are on the same level as The Shawshank\u000aRedemption.The story follows Andy Dufresne, a banker who is imprisoned for\u000amurdering his wife and her newfound lover. He claims he is innocent but\u000ais sentenced anyway. At Shawshank Prison, he meets and becomes friends\u000awith a man named Ellis Redding.This entire movie revolves around their relationship as friends and the\u000atype of bond they formed while in prison. Both come from different\u000abackgrounds: Andy as a successful banker who is wrongly convicted,\u000awhile Ellis is rightly convicted for murder. The movie has so much\u000adepth to these two characters and really fleshes them both out.The Shawshank Redemption is also a very powerful, moving film. Watching\u000athe movie, a person might think of Andy Dufresne as a modern "Jesus" as\u000ato how he is able to convince all of the guards to allow several\u000abenefits for each of his friends he meets in prison. He is able to do\u000aall of this with no fear as he confronts the main guard Captain Hadley\u000a(played in a stunning performance by Clancy Brown). Who knew Dr. Crabs\u000afrom Spongebob Squarepants could be this cruel.As time goes on at Shawshank, Andy gains the favor of eventually all\u000athe guards and has them for protection against a group called The\u000aSisters led by their leader Bogs. The warden even allows Andy to switch\u000ahis job to help out other inmates in another part of the prison.I must mention the other perfect performances of the other inmates.\u000aWilliam Sadler plays Heywood, who is one of Ellis's group of inmates.\u000aJames Whitmore plays the elderly Brooks Hatlen, who is the oldest\u000amember of Ellis's group. Honestly, these two actors have perfect\u000aperformances. Bob Gunton as Warden Samuel Norton is very sneaky and\u000aruthless. This movie will keep you guessing. Andy asks several times throughout\u000athe movie for different items. He gets them, but the viewer is clueless\u000atill the end of the movie. Andy does everything to make life at\u000aShawshank enjoyable by doing various deeds throughout the film (despite\u000athe protests from the guards and the warden). He doesn't seem to care\u000awhat others think and seems to do things for others.In the second half of the movie, a new prisoner named Tommy Williams\u000abecomes part of Ellis's group. With the arrival of Tommy, truths are\u000arevealed.I won't spoil anything about the ending, but Andy has one final\u000asurprise for everyone that will shock the viewers and everyone in\u000aShawshank Prison. Like I said earlier in the review, the whole movie\u000arevolves around Andy and Ellis's friendship.Stephen King created a novella called Rita Hayworth and Shawshank\u000aRedemption which Frank Darabont directed this in his first attempt as\u000adirector.Thank you Frank Darabont for creating this masterpiece. I also want to\u000athank Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman for portraying Andy Dufresne and\u000aEllis Redding respectively. Thank you Stephen King for writing the\u000abook. Thank you to everyone else who was involved in this.\u000a

V\u000aThis movie is a masterpiece. You may have seen some good movies but few\u000acan compare to this one. This is the plot. In 1947 a wrongly accused\u000abanker named Andy Dufrense (Tim Robbins) is sent to Shawshank Prison\u000afor murdering his wife. He meets the corrupt Warden, Samuel Norton (Bob\u000aGunton) and the brutal corrections officer, Captain Byron Hadley\u000a(Clancy Brown). He also meets the prison fixer Ellis "Red" Redding\u000a(Morgan Freeman) who was also incarcerated for murder. Andy and Red\u000asoon become good friends. Then one day while tarring the license plate\u000afactory roof, Andy helps Captain Hadley organize his money in a way\u000athat the government will be unable to take any taxes. Hadley tells the\u000aother officers about it, including Warden Norton and is soon doing tax\u000areturns for all the guards in Shawshank. Life is becoming better for\u000aAndy and his fellow inmates, when he pushes for more books for the\u000aprison library. Meanwhile the old prison librarian Brooks Hatlen (James\u000aWhitmore) is paroled from Shawshank. But Brooks can not adapt to life\u000aon the outside and hangs himself. Then things get worse when Norton\u000atries to get more money from illegal activities using Andy. In 1963 a\u000anew prisoner named Tommy Johnson (Gil Bellows) arrives at Shawshank and\u000areveals that he knows the man that killed Andy's wife. Andy tries to\u000abring this up to Norton, but Norton puts Andy in solitary and has\u000aHadley kill Tommy to keep him quiet. Now Andy has just about had\u000aenough. In 1947 Red got Andy a rock hammer, which he used to dig a\u000atunnel under his Rita Hayworth poster. When he was released from\u000asolitary years later he uses it and escapes Shawshank. He turns Norton\u000aand Hadley to the police, who arrest Hadley. Norton on the other hand\u000akills himself. In 1967 Red is paroled. He fears he will end up like\u000aBrooks but he made a promise to Andy to help him set up a hotel in\u000aMexico so Red travels there where the two friends are united. This film\u000ais great for a number of reasons. The friendship aspect between Andy\u000aand Red which grows over a long period of time. It also addresses the\u000aissue of rehabilitation and if prisoners who have been in there a large\u000aportion of their lives can ever be rehabilitated or if they just become\u000aadapted to prison life so much that they falter if sent to the outside\u000aworld. Overall it's just a great movie so I hugely recommend it.\u000a

V\u000aThis movie is simply amazing, no doubt about it. I found it moving yet\u000afunny in parts and it brought a tear to my eye. I would really\u000arecommend this movie to anyone because each person I have recommended\u000ait to has enjoyed it immensely and begs to watch it again. The ending\u000ais one that is very shocking but it all makes sense, making you want to\u000awatch it again to see how the ending could end in this way. Red was a\u000afavourite character of mine, not just because he was played brilliantly\u000aby Morgan Freeman, but also because this character brought humor to the\u000astory with a slight sad twist towards the end. I loved this movie and\u000ait will remain one of my favourites for a long time.\u000a

V\u000aThis isn't the type of movie that I would normally rave about. It's\u000aabout the triumph of hope over despair, and friendship over division -\u000ait's a feel good movie.But the truth is I think The Shawshank Redemption is absolutely\u000afantastic. When I try to put my finger on why I like this more than\u000aother feel good movies, I think it's largely because of the wonderful\u000acollision of brilliant characterisation and top-class performing that\u000ais Andy Dufresne played by Tim Robbins.The character of Andy - humble but steely, quiet but intelligent,\u000asimple but cunning - is just perfect for this movie. He's so different\u000ato almost any other prison break character you can imagine, and\u000aextremely engaging. And Tim Robbins is the perfect casting - he puts in\u000athe performance of a lifetime.Tim is very well supporting by Morgan Freeman as Red, and in fact the\u000aentire supporting cast does their job.The plot is interesting - it consists of a series of successes and\u000afalls for Andy. He keeps on picking himself and dusting himself down.\u000aYou end up assuming that it's all going to end tragically, which I\u000asuppose why his final, spectacular triumph is so uplifting. Yes, it's\u000aunrealistic, but it certainly won me over!\u000a

V\u000aIn 1946, a banker named Andy Dufresne (Tim Robbins) is convicted of a\u000adouble murder, even though he stubbornly proclaims his innocence. He's\u000asentenced to a life term at the Shawshank State Prison in Maine, where\u000aanother lifer, Ellis Red Redding (Morgan Freeman), picks him as the new\u000arecruit most likely to crack under the pressure. The ugly realities of\u000aprison life are quickly introduced to Andy: a corrupt warden (Bob\u000aGunton), sadistic guards led by Capt. Byron Hadley (Clancy Brown), and\u000ainmates who are little better than animals, willing to use rape or\u000abeatings to insure their dominance. But Andy does not crack: he has the\u000ahope of the truly innocent, which (together with his smarts) allow him\u000ato prevail behind bars. He uses his banking skills to win favor with\u000athe warden and the guards, doing the books for Norton's illegal\u000abusiness schemes and keeping an eye on the investments of most of the\u000aprison staff. In exchange, he is able to improve the prison library and\u000abring some dignity and respect back to many of the inmates, including\u000aRed. Based on a story by Stephen King,\u000a

V\u000aOne of, if not, the best movies I have ever come across. A very heart\u000awarming and inspirational film that never ceases to put a smile on my\u000aface no matter how many times I see it. Fill with memorable scenes and\u000adialog. Acting from Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman alone make this\u000amovie a great gem. The story is focused in a prison, but the focus of\u000athe film is hope, patience, redemption ( as in the title), and\u000afriendship. The movie contains a lot of symbolism, but it identifies\u000aitself quite clearly. I urge you if you call yourself a film fanatic to\u000ago watch this movie if you have never seen it. It has some the best\u000acharacters to it.\u000a

V\u000aWhat can I say about this movie that hasn't already been said? It's a\u000aprison movie, yes, but it is so much more than that. First, let me\u000adivvy out kudos to those who deserve it: Stephen King for writing this\u000amagnum opus, Frank Darabont for his stellar directing, Tim Robbins for\u000athe job he did and, of course, Morgan Freeman for knocking the ball out\u000aof the park one this movie.This was a movie that could be loved and felt by men and women alike.\u000aIt was about losses and gains, hope and despondence, injustice and\u000arectitude, and definitely about friendship. Prison just happened to be\u000athe backdrop of this film but it could have easily been anyplace. The\u000aprison setting played a critical role and was interwoven into the\u000aoverall story but it wasn't the story. The story was so much more and\u000athe movie did so well in pulling you in and making you care. You\u000acouldn't help but loathe the warden and his right-hand-man. You\u000acouldn't help but like Andy and Red. You couldn't help but want the\u000ahappy ending.Absolutely, Shawshank Redemption is a masterpiece. It didn't get the\u000aawards it deserved, but like the Utah Jazz in the late 90's playing the\u000aBulls, Shawshank Redemption faced tough competition. Although, it is\u000agetting its recognition here and it deserves the high praise.\u000a

V\u000aThe best thing about this movie is that it does not contain a single\u000aflaw. You can enjoy this movie throughout without getting bored for a\u000aminute. Excellent dialog delivery. The most important thing i liked in\u000athis movie is the casting.Each character in the movie makes a specific\u000aimpression on the viewer. You don't find any of the character as\u000aredundant. The at the start somewhat resembles to the Clint Eastwood\u000aStarred "Escape from Alcatraz" at start but then the movie takes you to\u000aaltogether different tour. Despite of absence of Eastwood's charisma\u000a"The Shawshank redemption" is leaps and bounds ahead of "Escape from\u000aAlcatraz". Morgan Freeman delivers again by his impeccable\u000anarration.The dialogs just wake up your soul, and if not then the solid\u000abackground music does the trick.Over the years this movie has been my\u000astandard to which i compare all other movies. Till now i have not found\u000aany movie which matches such perfection. I just "HOPE" that some day i\u000awill see a movie better than this one.A must watch movie for everyone.\u000aWatch this movie and you will be a better person with changed attitude\u000atowards life.\u000a

I gave "Shawshank" to many people I know and they still call me\u000ajust to say "Thank You". My friend's brother was once in hospital due\u000ato terrible accident and he said he wanted to watch "The Shawshank\u000aRedemption" before his death and I said how can a person love something\u000aso much and he got well and watched it and said-"I am not going to die\u000athis soon". I remember clearly my father once noticed me watching and I\u000asaid you should watch it (but he never watches any movie ever!!). He\u000arefused so much but I insisted and he watched it and cried and\u000arequested to buy him one another copy. He said "I'll give you money,\u000ajust I want all this director's films." I didn't know much about IMDb.\u000aI thought just critic review it. As soon as I found out, I just wanted\u000ato write to it.Also other Frank's movies like The Majestic (Best movie to watch with\u000aFamily) and The Mist (Heart-breaking end to watch ever.)Believe it this movie has a huge audience but they are not on IMDb.\u000aI've many many movies but nothing..not even Star Wars, Schindler's\u000aList, Forrest Gump, Casablanca, LOTR, Citizen Kane were and will be\u000aable to dethrone this KING (Stephen..I mean Frank Darabont).This will always be #1 (Along with "The Green Mile") to me until I die.\u000aBoth are my #1.

V\u000aWhen I watched this film at first time, I focused very much. Screenplay\u000ais very fluent and well-designed. The most significant point for this\u000afilm, in my opinion related to actors or characters as Andy Dufrense\u000aand Red. Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman played very convincing. I know\u000aleading role was offered Tom Hanks. But I am very satisfied Tim Robbins\u000aplayed this good role. On the other hand this film didn't have any\u000aawards as Academy and Golden Globe. This fact trouble me. I think the\u000amost splendid episode in this film: when guards call the roll in the\u000amorning everybody exits their rooms expect Andy and most of people\u000asuppose that (as me) he committed suicide but he left. All in all\u000anobody can deny that the biggest success was off the director of film\u000aFrank Darabont.\u000a

V\u000aThis is without a doubt one of the best movies I've ever seen. The\u000astory is not that original, I've seen other movies with a similar\u000astory. It's the way the movie is portrayed that makes this movie a\u000amasterpiece. The cast is great and you really feel with Andy the whole\u000atime.In the beginning Andy really had bad luck. To have your wife being\u000akilled at the moment you found out she had an affair. It's was also\u000areally unfortunate that he was near the crime scene with a gun. He\u000aseemed guilty. His first years in the prison were also very hard for\u000aAndy. At the moment he's doing better, I felt better. Then the story\u000acontinues to have an unexpected turn. The better Andy's life was going,\u000athe better I was feeling. I was very glad to see there was justice in\u000athe end.After you finish watching this movie, you feel really good. You feel\u000alike you've went through an incredible journey and it all ended well. I\u000awould recommend anyone I know to watch this movie as soon as possible.\u000a

V\u000aAn excellent film , from my point of view develops many aspects of life\u000asuch as freedom , fraternity , will, repentance ... embodied in all the\u000acharacters that make up the group of prisoners related to the\u000aprotagonist , and in contrast to these positive character issues , we\u000aalso show the abuse of power , selfishness , lack of ethics, lack of\u000aempathy ... sins embodied mainly in the 2 bad function : the warden and\u000athe head of the guards (the " Kurgan " from "Highlander" ) .The development of these human issues is completed by a classic story\u000aof survival in prison , seen in previous films and of course many post\u000a" The Shawshank Redemption " with a spectacular climax in the form of\u000ahappy ending , which will serve to please all those people who for one\u000areason or another are not interested in the "other issues " movie .How could it be otherwise , being a cinematic masterpiece , terrific\u000aperformances from the entire cast .Greetings friends !\u000a

V\u000aAndy Dufresne (Tim Robbins) is a banker convicted of murdering his wife\u000aand her lover. He always professes his innocence, but is thrown into\u000aShawshank Prison with other lifers like Red (Morgan Freeman).Director Frank Darabont has made a prison fable out of a Stephen King\u000ashort story. It is well acted by Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman.\u000aFreeman is especially important as he is the narrator and the POV of\u000athe story. It's his lyrical voice that makes this fable compelling. It\u000acould have easily been a simple prison movie that rang hollow. Freeman\u000agave the readings depth.If there is one complaint, it is Andy's claim of innocence. It needs to\u000abe shown early on during the trial. Instead, we derived mostly from\u000aAndy's demeanor. It needs to be a big declaration at the beginning.\u000aWhen Tommy (Gil Bellows) tells the story, he should include one detail\u000afrom the trial like the 8 bullets. That way, the audience can get an\u000aaha moment. It's a minor point, and overall this is a good prison\u000afable.\u000a

V\u000aA friend of mine who unbelievably loves movies, share an information\u000aabout this movie by the time i won a local short film award in\u000aIndonesia. He simply said that this is a must-see movie for a director\u000aor DP. So i tried hard to search for this film and finally found it.\u000aBefore seeing the movie, i read the credit title that impressed me\u000ainstantly. I thought "this is not gonna be bad at all". From the very\u000afirst scene to the last of it, I can only comment that this film really\u000ainspires me to write, produce and direct a neat story telling concept\u000awith a surprising ending. No wonder it gets the highest rated film here\u000abecause the moment i reached the ending, i can only WOW it. Genius!\u000a

V\u000aWhat a beautiful movie. I can watch this movie over and over. There is\u000anot one thing wrong with this picture. The beautiful settings. The\u000atalented cast. And I have to say Stephen King's greatest screenplay.\u000aTim Robbins plays the role of a life time. I love how he plays an\u000ainnocent criminal as he quietly escapes from a prison and returns to a\u000anormal life. Morgan Freeman was powerful. His wonderful sounding voice\u000aeases the audience through out the movie. A story of a friendship\u000abetween 2 convicted murderers over 30 years. I also love how elements\u000aof horror were added to this movie to have a true feel to a Stephen\u000aKing movie. The part where the guy gets dragged back into the cell is\u000amore haunting then any horror version of that same shot. This is a must\u000awatch for everyone. No matter where you catch this movie. Beginning,\u000amiddle, or, end, it is worth watching. <3\u000a

V\u000aThe Shawshank Redemption is without a doubt one of the most brilliant\u000amovies I have ever seen.What makes this film one of the best ever made\u000ais the message it conveys.It is one of eternal hope. Andy Dufresne, played by Tim Robbins, has\u000abeen sent to prison for a crime he did not commit. But he never loses\u000ahope. He never gives up his quest to become a free man again. His years\u000aof tenacity, patience and wits keep him not only sane, but it gives his\u000amind and a spirit a will to live. This film has a different feel to it.\u000aThere has never been anything like it before and I don't know if there\u000awill again.The best movies are ones that touch the soul. It takes a movie like The\u000aShawshank Redemption to touch the soul.\u000a

V\u000aTalk about your school of hard knocks. In The Shawshank Redemption\u000a(Columbia, R), Andy Dufresne (Tim Robbins), a tall, soft-spoken New\u000aEngland banker, is convicted-wrong- ly-of killing his adulterous wife\u000aand her lover. It's 1947, and Andy, having received a double life\u000asentence, is shipped off to Shawshank State Prison in Maine, a\u000amaximum-security fortress packed to the grimy gills with thieves,\u000arapists, and murderers. How bad is life at Shawshank? So bad that when\u000aAndy trudges off the bus along with a dozen other new inmates, the\u000aveteran prisoners make wagers on who'll be the first to cry. So bad\u000athat Andy finds a huge, wriggly yellow maggot buried in his lunch. So\u000abad that, over the next two years, he is systematically beaten and\u000araped by the Sisters, a crew of leering renegade inmates who take\u000aspecial delight in tormenting their fellow prisoners. Make no mistake:\u000aAndy gets worked over-and so does the audience.But then, good things have a way of happening to unfortunate movie\u000acharacters. Early in his stay, Andy makes the acquaintance of Red\u000a(Morgan Freeman), a sly survivor who is serving a life sentence for\u000amurder and who acts as Shawshank's one-man black market, smuggling the\u000aprisoners anything they want-cigarettes, reefer, cards with naked\u000aladies (''I'm a regular Sears and Roebuck,'' he deadpans). As soon as\u000aAndy bonds with Red, things start to ! look up. He gets hold of a rock\u000ahammer so that he can sculpt an elegant chess set. He does the guards'\u000atax returns in exchange for perks like beer on a sunbaked afternoon. He\u000aexpands the dusty, neglected book room into the most comprehensive\u000aprison library in New England. Set over a period of 20 years (the\u000apassing decades are marked by Andy's pinup posters of Rita Hayworth,\u000athen Marilyn, then Raquel), The Shawshank Redemption begins as a\u000anightmare, a postwar- New England Midnight Express, but it doesn't take\u000along to reveal its true, feel-good colors. The movie is about survival,\u000atriumph, and a thing called hope. It's about a hero who rises above the\u000asqualor because he's blessed-a saint in the muck. It's Midnight Express\u000aGoes Gump.You need a certain craftsmanship to traffic in twin brands of\u000amanipulation- the exploitative and the sentimental-and there's no\u000adenying that Frank Darabont, who wrote and directed The Shawshank\u000aRedemption (it's based on a short novel by Stephen King), knows just\u000awhat he's doing. The moss-dark, saturated images have a redolent\u000asensuality; you feel as if you could reach out and touch the prison\u000awalls. And Darabont is an accomplished button pusher. He coaches the\u000aactors so that you always know exactly who to root for and against.\u000aWhen it comes to a character like the warden (Bob Gunton), all Bible-\u000athumping righteousness, the movie has no compunction about turning up\u000athe hissability factor. He starts out mean, then turns meaner, then\u000ameaner still. When Andy blasts Mozart's The Marriage of Figaro over\u000aloudspeakers to the prison work field, it becomes a full-scale\u000aopera-soothes-the-savage-breast number, with the prisoners standing\u000aopen-mouthed at the sublime sounds. The scene is meant to fire our\u000arighteous liberal hearts. It helps, of course, that most of the\u000aprisoners don't actually behave like criminals. They never say a word\u000aabout their pasts-even Andy remains a downtrodden cipher-and this lends\u000athe proceedings a hollow, generic feel, as if Darabont had constructed\u000aa blueprint out of old prison melodramas.A movie like The Shawshank Redemption, with its brazenly mechanical\u000aplotting and its wish-fulfillment finale, requires a lead actor who can\u000acarry us on the wings of his good spirits. Tim Robbins is crafty and\u000alikable when Andy is hoodwinking the guards, and he makes you feel the\u000acharacter's mute anguish. Yet in shouldering what is essentially a\u000alaconic- good-guy, neo-Gary Cooper role, Robbins never quite makes\u000aemotional contact with the audience. His face, foggy and placid,\u000asuggests an overgrown baby's; there's something naggingly unformed\u000aabout him. Morgan Freeman, on the other hand, with his delicate\u000asmolder, his eyes that seem to peer directly into everyone's soul,\u000amakes Red feel genuine, lived-in. Speaking of the prison walls, he\u000asays, ''First you hate 'em. Then you get used to 'em.After long enough, you get so you depend on 'em. That's\u000ainstitutionalized.'' With his gift for rapt pauses, for caressing just\u000athe right syllable, Freeman can make a speech like that sound like one\u000aof the philosophical nuggets of the ages. Then again, isn't it time\u000aMorgan Freeman stopped playing the soulful sidekick? While we're on the\u000asubject of prison walls, an actor as great as he is shouldn't get too\u000aused to movies like this one. B-\u000a

It's a fantastic example of the\u000apower of hope and the true nature of the human spirit.

Without a doubt, one biennium film, the protagonist is a\u000acharacter you acutes very easily and that story is impossible that you\u000aare not put goosebumps. The cast Maimonides as the rest of the movie.\u000aNot die without seeing this masterpiece.

All people make mistakes and\u000asince the government is run by humans of course there are going to be\u000aflaws. I had watched this movie for the first time with my dad and I\u000aloved watching it since.

V\u000aThe Shawshank Redemption is a magnificent tale of friendship and hope.\u000aLed by great acting all around, it is a almost flawless movie. Morgan\u000aFreeman is at his best in this film. This has been my favorite movie\u000asince I was a teenager, and I think it's going to last a while. The\u000amovie as a whole is incredible, but the ending is what made the movie\u000amy favorite. After watching Shawshank, I was unable to think for\u000aseveral hours. The movie put me in a trance that consisted of me just\u000ataking in what I have watched. I have never witnessed such an\u000aincredible ending to anything in the movie industry. A must see for\u000aanyone who enjoys a good movie, I promise it will not disappoint.\u000a

V\u000aWell what can I say but, Freeman, who is simply a great actor, a man\u000awho has never struck a false note in his career, both narrates this\u000atale and anchors it with his authoritative playing. Powerful, poignant,\u000athought-provoking and finally irresistibly uplifting. The Shawshank\u000aRedemption works not only as an excellent prison drama, but as a\u000ametaphor for overcoming our own private prisons.An amazing movie.\u000aEasily one of the best movies made during the 90s and definitely one of\u000athe top 'prison' movies of all-time. Pretty much everything about this\u000amovie works and works extremely well! I have not read Stephen King's\u000anovella (his first non-horror), but some of the movie's deficiencies,\u000asuch as the old-fashioned morality tale and portentous message about\u000acamaraderie and redemption--must have been in the source material.\u000a

The end is great and\u000aafter the movie is over they just leaving you hanging on a "What's\u000anext" Like no other.

It makes me think of the essence of filmmaking and\u000astorytelling, and how much that aspect of our industry is really\u000ahonored. Every Director wants to tell a great story, but few let the\u000astory tell itself. This is an intelligent film because it gets so\u000ainvolved with our character driven plot lines that you forget you're\u000awatching a movie at all. As a young filmmaker, this film is a fantastic\u000amodel to build a foundation around. Let's just hope studio thoughts\u000adon't pick up and they try to make a sequel/prequel...\u000a

V\u000aIn 1947, banker Andy Dufresne (Tim Robbins) is convicted of murdering\u000ahis wife and her lover, based on circumstantial evidence, and is\u000asentenced to two consecutive life sentences at Shawshank State\u000aPenitentiary. Andy quickly befriends contraband smuggler Ellis "Red"\u000aRedding (Morgan Freeman), an inmate serving a life sentence. Red\u000aprocures a rock hammer for Andy, allowing him to create small stone\u000achess pieces. Red later gets him a large poster of Rita Hayworth,\u000afollowed in later years by images of Marilyn Monroe and Raquel Welch.\u000aAndy works in the prison laundry, but is regularly assaulted by the\u000a"bull queer" gang "the Sisters" and their leader Bogs (Mark Rolston).In 1949, Andy overhears the brutal chief guard Byron Hadley (Clancy\u000aBrown) complaining about taxes on a forthcoming inheritance and informs\u000ahim about a financial loophole. After another vicious assault by the\u000aSisters nearly kills Andy, Hadley severely beats Bogs resulting in Bogs\u000abeing sent to another prison. Andy is not attacked again. Warden Samuel\u000aNorton (Bob Gunton) meets with Andy and reassigns him to the prison\u000alibrary to assist elderly inmate Brooks Hatlen (James Whitmore), a\u000apretext for Andy to manage financial duties for the prison. His advice\u000aand expertise are soon sought by other guards at Shawshank and from\u000anearby prisons. Andy begins writing weekly letters to the state\u000agovernment for funds to improve the decrepit library.In 1954, Brooks is freed on parole, but unable to adjust to the outside\u000aworld after 50 years in prison, he hangs himself. Andy receives a\u000alibrary donation that includes a recording of The Marriage of Figaro.\u000aHe plays an excerpt over the public address system, resulting in his\u000areceiving solitary confinement. After his release, Andy explains that\u000ahe holds onto hope as something that the prison cannot take from him,\u000abut Red dismisses the idea. In 1963, Norton begins exploiting prison\u000alabor for public works, profiting by undercutting skilled labor costs\u000aand receiving kickbacks. He has Andy launder the money using the alias\u000a"Randall Stephens".In 1965, Tommy Williams (Gil Bellows) is incarcerated for burglary. He\u000ajoins Andy's and Red's circle of friends, and Andy helps him pass his\u000aGeneral Educational Development (G.E.D.) examinations. In 1966, after\u000ahearing the details of Andy's case, Tommy reveals that an inmate at\u000aanother prison claimed responsibility for an identical murder,\u000asuggesting Andy's innocence. Andy approaches Norton with this\u000ainformation, but the warden refuses to listen. Norton places Andy in\u000asolitary confinement and has Hadley murder Tommy, under the guise of an\u000aescape attempt. Andy refuses to continue with the scam, but Norton\u000athreatens to destroy the library and take away his protection and\u000apreferential treatment. After Andy is released from solitary\u000aconfinement, he tells Red of his dream of living in Zihuatanejo, a\u000aMexican Pacific coastal town. While Red shrugs it off as being\u000aunrealistic, Andy instructs him, should he ever be freed, to visit a\u000aspecific hayfield near Buxton to retrieve a package.The next day at roll call, upon finding Andy's cell empty, an irate\u000aNorton throws one of Andy's rocks at the poster of Raquel Welch hanging\u000aon the wall. The rock tears through the poster, revealing a tunnel that\u000aAndy had dug with his rock hammer over the previous two decades. The\u000aprevious night, Andy escaped through the tunnel and the prison's sewage\u000apipe with Norton's ledger, containing details of the money laundering.\u000aWhile guards search for him the following morning, Andy, posing as\u000aRandall Stephens, visits several banks to withdraw the laundered money.\u000aFinally, he sends the ledger and evidence of the corruption and murders\u000aat Shawshank to a local newspaper. The police arrive at Shawshank and\u000atake Hadley into custody, while Norton commits suicide to avoid arrest.After serving 40 years, Red receives parole. He struggles to adapt to\u000alife outside prison and fears he never will. Remembering his promise to\u000aAndy, he visits Buxton and finds a cache containing money and a letter\u000aasking him to come to Zihuatanejo. Red violates his parole and travels\u000ato Fort Hancock, Texas to cross the border to Mexico, admitting he\u000afinally feels hope. On a beach in Zihuatanejo, he finds Andy, and the\u000atwo friends are happily reunited.\u000a

V\u000aWithout doubt one of the most endearing stories to touch the human\u000asoul. Very rare a film succeeds in taking the mantle away from the\u000anovel. However this is one of those cases when it simply just does.This soul finding, awe inspiring against all the odds film is a great\u000aadaptation of Stephen King's 1982 Novella entitled 'Rita Hayworth and\u000aShawshank Redemption'.This is the film that will make you think that there is hope in the\u000aworld and that with great perseverance 'anything can be over come'. Set\u000ain the times of what looks like the depression and located within the\u000abackdrop of the sleepy south of America.A man sent to prison for life for a crime he did not commit, and how\u000athis alien world of the lower reaches of society seem at first that he\u000awill be broken and beaten and either die or go mad (as so many of the\u000ainmates succumb to). As Simon and Garfunkel had their books and poetry\u000a'to protect them (me)' so the lead character Andy Dufresne has his to\u000aprotect him from such failings. In Rita Hayworth he has a passage of\u000aphysical escape as opposed to the virtual world of books. He gains\u000arespect over time not through physical violence but by the craft of his\u000amind and sheer willpower. Like a chess master he is thinking several\u000amoves ahead of everyone. Even the old master lag played by Morgan\u000aFreeman can only watch this man from a distance. However he relays\u000athrough mainly past tense commentary how this man was as GB Shaw would\u000asay was 'Superman'. Eventually like a great master he exposes the\u000alies,hypocrisy and greed of the evil church going warden. This is not a\u000afilm but a journey to the very survival of the human soul and as the\u000alead character passes through leads a golden light on those condemned\u000aeven if only for a passing moment in time. Like a bird on a journey he\u000ais destined to be free. Enjoy this film because it may if only for a\u000amoment save your soul.\u000a

The\u000aold Brooks, former manager of the library outside is nothing and\u000acommits suicide.He has a special treatment to keep the accounts of the corrupt warden,\u000athat prisoners performing work with which anyone can compete, and\u000acompanies who want to work you must pay a hefty commission that Andy\u000abecomes white money, inventing a fictitious character where even get\u000alegal papers.Andy is also responsible for helping those who wish to study, including\u000aTommy, a boy who wants to change his life. Thanks to him, Tommy manages\u000ato get the graduate. And is the guy who tells him that in one of the\u000aprisons in which he was matched with a guy who told her he had killed a\u000agolfer and his mistress and the fact that her husband accused her. Andy\u000asees in confession a glimmer of hope, which is truncated by the warden,\u000athat does not help and ends with the only thread of hope, making kill\u000aTommy. Andy himself will spend two months in solitary confinement for\u000arefusing to follow accounting warden.The output will return to it, but that night disappears from his cell\u000awithout anyone knowing what happened to him, until they discover a\u000atunnel after a large poster of Raquel Welch. And once outside, the bank\u000awill draw up character warden $ 300,000, in addition to sending a\u000aletter with proof of corruption all the press. Norton commits suicide.Some time later, after 40 years in prison is released Network For him,\u000alife on the outside is as absurd as to Brooks, and think back to crime\u000ato return to their "home". It only holds a promise I made to Andy that\u000ahe would go to a field where there was something for him. He does and\u000afinds enough money to go to the place where Andy said that if one day\u000abe installed leaving a Mexican village by the Pacific where a hotel\u000aride. Red goes there to be his assistant.Great movie, you see them.\u000a

V\u000aAfter watching "The Shawshank Redemption" I realize that the comment I\u000asaw on the movie were not exaggerating, not a movie with light sabers,\u000anor with mafia phrases, much less killing to kill bill, but if you have\u000atwo men talking to each teaching us to value life. I've always been\u000alooking for the perfect movie for me perfect film is one that touches\u000athe soul, this movie, no effects, no fiction, I was succeeded, I found\u000athe perfect movie. Showing us a point of view that many perhaps have\u000anot known yet, one of the few movies that generates feeling.That's why\u000ait makes the best movie made \u200b\u200bso far "Keep busy living or get busy\u000adying"\u000a

V\u000aOne of the best and must watch movie which i ever enjoyed....Shawshank\u000aencompasses friendships, hardships, hopes, and dreams. And what is so\u000agreat about the movie is that it moves you, it gives you hope. Even\u000athough the circumstances between the characters and the viewers are\u000aquite different, you don't feel that far removed from what the\u000acharacters are going through.It is a simple film, yet it has an everlasting message. Frank Darabont\u000adidn't need to put any kind of outlandish special effects to get us to\u000alove this film, the narration and the acting does that for him. Why\u000athis movie didn't win all seven Oscars is beyond me, but don't let that\u000asway you to not see this film, let its ranking on the IMDb's top 250\u000alist sway you, let your friends recommendation about the movie sway\u000ayou.Set aside a little over two hours tonight and rent this movie. You will\u000afinally understand what everyone is talking about and you will\u000aunderstand why this is my all time favorite movie.\u000a

V\u000aThe more times you watch it, the more you love it, and the more you\u000alearn from it. An absolutely encouraging story to those who are\u000adesperate or sad or complaining about bad luck. If you never give up\u000aand try to figure out a way ahead, nothing can stop you to the\u000abrightness and freedom. Everything you have experienced will bring you\u000apositive influences if you take it positively. I have watched it for\u000amany times, at least ten times I guess. Now I hope I can download it\u000aand keep it and enjoy it once I have time.

V\u000a"Salvation lies within." -Warden Norton to Andy.I do not believe there is such a thing as a perfect movie. However,\u000athis, it is a masterpiece.I was not even alive when this movie was released. I didn't know of it\u000auntil maybe four years ago. Since then, I have seen this movie multiple\u000atimes and honestly, I don't get tired of it. This is among the most\u000apowerful stories ever told in a film. Ever. This movie is simply about\u000afriendship. The friendship that takes form over roughly 20 years in a\u000aMaine prison. One man, is in prison for murder. He is guilty. However,\u000ahis friend, is not guilty. An innocent man is placed in prison for two\u000alife sentences for a crime he did not commit.Red (played masterfully by Morgan Freeman)is the guilty man, while Andy\u000aDufresne (played wonderfully by Tim Robbins) is the innocent man.The two of them show remarkable chemistry. They pull this off simply by\u000atalking to each other throughout the movie. Usually when I see a\u000atrailer for a movie today, there's explosions, or a natural disaster or\u000agang wars or something. This movie consists almost 99.9999999% simple\u000atalking. And its done to perfection.With a well done script, terrific acting, and a very good ending, this\u000amovie will forever be among the greatest ever.There are countless moments in this movie where you feel moved,\u000ainspired, or you feel that you've learned something.I would recommend this film to anyone and everyone. A true masterpiece.\u000a

V\u000aThis film is really an amazing movie timeless. One of my all time favorites. About the long-can write something in a movie. Masters said everything I needed There is not yet aware of the movie\u000aand I watched it for people to watch I would like to invite.Than You.Shawshank Redemption is a very moving story about hope and the power of\u000afriendship. The cast is first rate with everyone giving a great\u000aperformance. Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman carry the movie, but Bob\u000aGunton and Clancy Brown are perfect as the Warden Norton and prison\u000aguard captain Hadley respectively. And James Whitmore's portrayal of an\u000aelderly inmate Brooks is moving. The screenplay gives almost every\u000aactor at least one or more memorable lines through out the film. As\u000awell as a very surprising "twist" near the end that almost knocked me\u000aout of my chair. If you have not seen this movie rent it or better yet\u000abuy it. As I bet you'll want to see this one more than once.\u000a

V\u000a"The Shawshank Redemption" is a timeless story of heartbreak, deception\u000aand ultimate growth under the most deplorable conditions. The acting is superior, some of Tim Robbins' and Morgan Freeman's best\u000awork as they allow me an intimate look inside the sometimes\u000acontradictory nature of a convict's existence, where I am torn\u000aemotionally between danger and safety, light and shadow, sanity and\u000asorrow, truth and lies, injustice and justice. In fact, I am lost in\u000aall the actors' poignant and memorable portrayals of young thugs, cruel\u000aguards, swindlers, thieves, rapists and murders, all standing in their\u000arespective spaces quietly listening together to an operatic aria over a\u000aloudspeaker on the prison yard.In this movie, I find almost no one to be all good or all bad. There\u000aare exceptions, though. Although there are those in charge of the\u000aprison I wish to be caught in a snare of their own making or worse,\u000athere are still others behind prison walls that turn out to be heroes I\u000acheer on to win in the end. Like people in real life, most of the\u000acharacters in "The Shawshank Redemption," both prisoners and guards\u000a(those that are not miserably rotten to the bone), represent many\u000ashades of gray.One of the most touching moments in "The Shawshank Redemption" is a\u000ascene in which an elderly convict, who has spent the better part of his\u000aadult life locked up, is brokenheartedly paroled into a modern world\u000athat is as alien to him as his outdated suit and boyhood memories. And\u000ahis fear of this new and unnatural terrain, crawling with shadier\u000acreatures than those he had known behind bars and the exhaust fumes of\u000aa thousand horseless carriages rushing past, engulfed him with no hope\u000aof ever escaping."Fear can hold you prisoner. Hope can set you free," from "The\u000aShawshank Redemption."As bonds form between people of different ethnic groups, economic\u000abackgrounds and intellectual levels, I rejoice in their discovery of\u000athe human dignity they share. As the story unfolds, my heart hurts so\u000ahard, I cry. Then, with tears still in my eyes, I laugh, the same way\u000amy family used to laugh together at dinner or a movie when I was a\u000alittle girl.Getting older. Times changing. People leaving. Dying. But at the core of the main character's spirit there shines upon all\u000athose who are within its range, including me, a contagious hope\u000aeternal. I am still astonished with the euphoria that fills my being\u000aeach time I view this incredible story about the invincible human\u000aspirit.\u000a

V\u000aThis movie is one of my all time favorites. Undoubtedly, one of the\u000amost brilliant movies I have ever seen. Story, cast, screenplay all are\u000agreat. The directing by Frank Darabont was just magnificent. The\u000aamazing casting of both Morgan Freeman and Tim Robbins is amazing, and\u000acouldn't be more accurate. It was narrated by Morgan Freeman, who is\u000athe best narrator in Hollywood, I believe. Actually the film depends on\u000athe story and the way in which it unravels. It will change the way u\u000athink about things around u. Surely, It will teach you one thing that\u000ait is easy to take away a man's bread, even his freedom, but impossible\u000ato take away his hope.I can say with confidence this is the best movie I have ever seen - or\u000aever will see.

V\u000aCould a movie be any more perfect? This movie is just absolutely\u000astunning in so many ways. Acting perfect, storyline perfect, soundtrack\u000aperfect, emotional drama perfect, everything about this movie is\u000aperfect.When this movie first came out it did not reach the expectations that\u000amany people expected it to. But as the years went one it was nominated\u000afor seven Academy Awards and as it was available for rent everywhere\u000amore people started appreciating it and it's popularity grew.\u000aEventually after many years in the top 5 of IMDb's top 250 movies of\u000aall time list, it hit number 1 with over one million votes.The story is about a well educated vice president of a large bank being\u000awrongly accused of murdering his wife and her lover and is sentenced to\u000aspend life at a large prison in new England called Shawshank prison. As\u000athe years go on in his new home he makes friends, enemys and a dramatic\u000atwist at the end which became one of the most legendary scenes in movie\u000ahistory.I love this movie. The acting is just so passionate and their\u000aperformances increases the drama and horror of life in prison. The\u000asoundtrack is one of the main reason behind the emotional drama this\u000amovie. Many scenes in this movie almost left me in tears mainly because\u000aof the soundtrack in the background which increases the emotion. The cast of this movie include Academy Awards winners Morgan Freeman\u000aand Tim Robbins. And also William Sadler, Bob Gunton and many other who\u000amade this movie what it is.Overall it is defiantly the Greatest movie ever made with passionate\u000aacting, great storyline and plenty of emotional drama about how hope\u000aovercomes fear in a beautifully crafted film about the strength of the\u000ahuman spirit.\u000a

V\u000a"The Shawshank Redemption" is a movie about time, patience and loyalty\u000a-- not sexy qualities, perhaps, but they grow on you during the\u000asubterranean progress of this story, which is about how two men serving\u000alife sentences in prison become friends and find a way to fight off\u000adespair.The shawshank redemption is a brilliant film that is\u000abeautifully acted with and insbiring and uplifting message message of\u000ahope. in my opinion the film should have at least one Oscar to show for\u000ait's brilliance. it is truly sad that know one could see how superior\u000ashawshank is to the wearisome Forest gump. i think that if shawshank\u000ahad been released more recently it would have hands down won best\u000apicture it is one of the few films that are worthy of being called\u000aperfect\u000a

V\u000aIt's very rare that you find such diversity in a movie now days. I like\u000athe story and it's concept.A thumping good ode to friendship, hope,\u000awit, wiles and wisdom, brimming with crackling characters and topped\u000awith the most twister of twists since "The Crying Game." The Shawshank\u000aRedemption is a powerful and uplifting, not to mention Oscar-worthy\u000afilm. In 2006, it was ranked as the greatest film ever by Empire, a\u000afilm magazine. The year it came out it was nominated for 7 academy\u000aawards but did not win a single one because of a movie you may all\u000aremember, Forrest Gump. It's the no-bull performances that hold back\u000athe flood of banalities. Robbins and Freeman connect with the bruised\u000asouls of Andy and Red to create something undeniably powerful and\u000amoving. Some of "The Shawshank Redemption'' comes across as\u000aoutrageously improbable. Yet the film keeps pulling you back with its\u000asense of striving humanity slowly turning the tables against evil.\u000a

Just think of these misfits as beyond redemption.I saw this film in 1995 and still vividly felt the euphoria of the\u000afinal half hour which stayed with me for a couple of weeks.I was convinced this was the best film I had ever seen in my life, even\u000abetter than Akira Kurosawa's Ran and One flew over the cuckoo's nest,\u000awhich was my all time favorite until TSR came along.I excitedly contacted my best friend who shared the same passion and he\u000aconfirmed my thoughts,"this must be the best film I've ever seen!" But\u000ait is sad though that I will probably never see a better film for the\u000arest of my life as I have seen the best.In music I have heard the best in Rush and Jackson Browne which made\u000aothers pale in comparison and in movies I have TSR.Hail Frank Darabont!\u000a

V\u000aThis is one of the most amazing movies I've ever watched.It is based on a Steven King book, which makes the plot not\u000apredictable. The story twists and turns, while during the movie it\u000aseems that it is heading on a straight path forward.It tells the story of a banker which is accused of murdering his wife\u000aand her lover. He is sentenced to life in prison, and placed in the\u000aShawshank prison, where he meets a group of inmates which become his\u000aclose friends during the decades he spends in prison. The movie tells\u000athe story of his life and struggles in the prison environment. Any\u000aaddition to the abstract will spoil the experience, and perhaps be a\u000aspoiler. The amazing casting of both Morgan Freeman and Tim Robbins is amazing,\u000aand couldn't be more accurate.I remember the first time I saw this movie (many more viewing after\u000athat, the movie just don't get old) I was engulfed in it for the whole\u000aduration.A must-see movie for anyone and everyone.\u000a

V\u000aIn 1947, banker Andy Dufresne (Tim Robbins) is convicted of murdering\u000ahis wife and her lover, based on circumstantial evidence, and is\u000asentenced to two consecutive life sentences at Shawshank State\u000aPenitentiary. Andy quickly befriends contraband smuggler Ellis "Red"\u000aRedding (Morgan Freeman), an inmate serving a life sentence. Red\u000aprocures a rock hammer for Andy, allowing him to create small stone\u000achess pieces. Red later gets him a large poster of Rita Hayworth,\u000afollowed in later years by images of Marilyn Monroe and Raquel Welch.\u000aAndy works in the prison laundry, but is regularly assaulted by the\u000a"bull queer" gang "the Sisters" and their leader Bogs (Mark Rolston).\u000aIn 1949, Andy overhears the brutal chief guard Byron Hadley (Clancy\u000aBrown) complaining about taxes on a forthcoming inheritance and informs\u000ahim about a financial loophole. After another vicious assault by the\u000aSisters nearly kills Andy, Hadley severely beats Bogs resulting in Bogs\u000abeing sent to another prison. Andy is not attacked again. Warden Samuel\u000aNorton (Bob Gunton) meets with Andy and reassigns him to the prison\u000alibrary to assist elderly inmate Brooks Hatlen (James Whitmore), a\u000apretext for Andy to manage financial duties for the prison. His advice\u000aand expertise are soon sought by other guards at Shawshank and from\u000anearby prisons. Andy begins writing weekly letters to the state\u000agovernment for funds to improve the decrepit library. In 1954, Brooks\u000ais freed on parole, but unable to adjust to the outside world after 50\u000ayears in prison, he hangs himself. Andy receives a library donation\u000athat includes a recording of The Marriage of Figaro. He plays an\u000aexcerpt over the public address system, resulting in his receiving\u000asolitary confinement. After his release, Andy explains that he holds\u000aonto hope as something that the prison cannot take from him, but Red\u000adismisses the idea. In 1963, Norton begins exploiting prison labor for\u000apublic works, profiting by undercutting skilled labor costs and\u000areceiving kickbacks. He has Andy launder the money using the alias\u000a"Randall Stephens". In 1965, Tommy Williams (Gil Bellows) is\u000aincarcerated for burglary. He joins Andy's and Red's circle of friends,\u000aand Andy helps him pass his General Educational Development (G.E.D.)\u000aexaminations. In 1966, after hearing the details of Andy's case, Tommy\u000areveals that an inmate at another prison claimed responsibility for an\u000aidentical murder, suggesting Andy's innocence. Andy approaches Norton\u000awith this information, but the warden refuses to listen. Norton places\u000aAndy in solitary confinement and has Hadley murder Tommy, under the\u000aguise of an escape attempt. Andy refuses to continue with the scam, but\u000aNorton threatens to destroy the library and take away his protection\u000aand preferential treatment. After Andy is released from solitary\u000aconfinement, he tells Red of his dream of living in Zihuatanejo, a\u000aMexican Pacific coastal town. While Red shrugs it off as being\u000aunrealistic, Andy instructs him, should he ever be freed, to visit a\u000aspecific hayfield near Buxton to retrieve a package. The next day at\u000aroll call, upon finding Andy's cell empty, an irate Norton throws one\u000aof Andy's rocks at the poster of Raquel Welch hanging on the wall. The\u000arock tears through the poster, revealing a tunnel that Andy had dug\u000awith his rock hammer over the previous two decades. The previous night,\u000aAndy escaped through the tunnel and the prison's sewage pipe with\u000aNorton's ledger, containing details of the money laundering. While\u000aguards search for him the following morning, Andy, posing as Randall\u000aStephens, visits several banks to withdraw the laundered money.\u000aFinally, he sends the ledger and evidence of the corruption and murders\u000aat Shawshank to a local newspaper.

V\u000aThis was a reflection of the 'count of Montecristo', especially the\u000ajailbreak scene. But still i find it fascinating enough to impress me\u000aand have a lot of ingredient included in it. This is probably the most\u000aamazing movies from the nineties apart from Forrestgump and back to the\u000afuture and all. It also reminded me of the series The Oz, Its cool and\u000aall, but there's this mainstream way of showing jail and high school as\u000athe same in Hollywood a lot. probably so but i'm afraid that not to be\u000atrue.And one more thing i noticed was that viewers seems to be confused\u000aa number of times as the story slips from one another scene and is\u000areally complicated. that is it started as a man who have been betrayed\u000aby his love to who've been framed then jailed bitched from there and\u000arules there becomes everyone's favorite and the warden becomes his\u000aworst enemy and teaches him a lesson while he was on the go.\u000a

V\u000aThis movie is not your ordinary Hollywood flick. It has a great and\u000adeep message. This movie has a foundation and just kept on being built\u000aon from their and that foundation is hope.Other than just the message of this movie the acting was phenomenal.\u000aTim Robbins gave one of the greatest performances ever. He was\u000ainspiring, intelligent and most of all positive. His performance just\u000amade me smile. Robbins plays Andy Dufresne who was wrongfully convicted\u000aof murdering his wife and her lover. He is gets to life sentences but\u000ayet never gives up hope. In he becomes friends with Ellis Boyd "Red"\u000aRedding played by Morgan Freeman. Freeman who gives the finest\u000aperformance of his career has unlike Robbins lost hope. He is in deep\u000aregret of the crime that he committed. His way of deflecting the pain\u000aaway is by trying to not feel anything at all. With his friendship with\u000aAndy he learns that without our hopes and dreams we have nothing. Andy\u000aalso becomes friends with the rest of Red's group. James Whitmore also\u000agave a great performance as Brooks Halten who gets out of prison parole\u000abut in the words of Red he has been "institutionalized".The directing by Frank Darabont was just magnificent. He kept this\u000amovie at a great steady pace along with the writing and great\u000acinematography. He portrayed prison life in such a horrifying way, but\u000anot in terms of the physical pain but the stress and pain that wares\u000amentally on the inmates, some of which deserve a second chance.Whatever you do, don't listen to the people who say this movie is\u000aoverrated because this is one of the most inspiring and greatest movies\u000aever. It has everything you could possibly want.\u000a

V\u000aThere is a reason the Shawshank Redemption has been at #1 of the IMDb\u000atop 250 for as long as I can remember. It is probably the best movie\u000athat has ever been made. Not because of the thrilling special effects\u000a(it hardly has any). Not because of the daring, experimental\u000ainnovations it has brought us (it is a quite straightforward movie).\u000aBut because of its simple, beautiful storyline and its great\u000acharacters."They send you here for life. That's exactly what they take." The\u000astrength of this movie is that Darabont is able to show what it means\u000ato completely lose are perspective and dreams for the future. To show\u000ahow the people inside shed off their old lives and get used to the\u000aterrible life in Shawshank prison. We can truly understand how a man\u000acan become 'institutionalized.' How people get used to living under a\u000arepressive regime and can't face changing it. We see how the old Brooks\u000acan't deal with the world around him and commits suicide. How Red faces\u000athe same challenges when he can't take a leak without asking\u000apermission. Inside the joint these men had a certain standing, they\u000awere important people. Being set free is not easy when your live has\u000abeen taken from you.- "Why did you do it? - I didn't, since you ask. - You gonna fit right\u000ain."Half of the movie we don't know for sure whether Andy is guilty or not.\u000aIt doesn't matter so much. What is important is not his past.\u000aRehabilitated? What does that word even mean? In prison you live a\u000awhole different life. With whole different rules. Without a past. Or a\u000afuture. Andy is the exemption. He shows us the remedy against becoming\u000ainstitutionalized. By never accepting our destiny. By never giving up.\u000aBy always keeping our dreams alive."- There are places in the world that aren't made out of stone. There\u000ais something inside that they can't touch. - What are you talking\u000aabout? -Hope. - Let me tell you something my friend, hope is a\u000adangerous thing. Hope can drive a man insane. You better get used to\u000athat idea."But Andy doesn't get used to that idea. He has received two things by\u000athe warden. "Discipline and the bible." And he uses these two things to\u000aget out and escape to the paradise called Zihujataneo. There are two\u000athings that make this movie so extremely good. The first thing is that\u000awe all can relate to Andy. "I must admit, I didn't think much of Andy first time I laid eyes on\u000ahim. He had a quit way about him. A walk and a talk that just wasn't\u000anormal around here."Andy is a normal guy. He is smart, he is doing good. But he is not\u000aextremely strong, or extremely smart, or extremely rich. In other\u000awords: he is us. He is elevated a little bit above the criminals in\u000aprison, but his two most important characteristics are characteristics\u000athat, deep down inside us, we all have: hope and determination. These\u000atwo emotion are so strong and so pure, that we all love to see the live\u000aof Andy. That is what makes this movie so appealing.And by living just your live as best as you can, by never giving up and\u000aby keeping your dignity at all times, we see that we can inspire\u000apeople. Brooks was here. So was Red. Red didn't choose that path of\u000aBrooks. Red hasn't become completely institutionalized. Because he\u000alived with Andy and dreamed a bit of his dreams.We, the normal movie-watchers, have never been to prison. And\u000acertainly, there is nobody who can play the role of an older brother as\u000athe great Morgan Freeman, and this might be his best performance of his\u000alive. Darabont shows a lot of skill in movie-directing and can let\u000ayears pass in his movie without one moment losing our attention. There\u000ais a great soundtrack, which breathes the smell of Southern America\u000ainto our living rooms. But I'm convinced that what makes this movie so\u000agreat is that it inspires us all.We are not stuck in a prison, but certainly we can be stuck in our\u000alives. Change is hard and also outside of prison it is possible to\u000abecome institutionalized. We can have a life that seems to have no past\u000aand not future. That seems to be unrelated to all the other things that\u000ahappen in the world. Andy learns us to never give up. To never lose\u000afaith. To always keep hoping and dreaming about paradise."I guess it comes down to a simple choice. Get busy living or get busy\u000adying."\u000a

V\u000a"I wish I could tell you that Andy fought the good fight, and the\u000aSisters let him be. I wish I could tell you that - but prison is no\u000afairy-tale world.". I think this line by Morgan Freeman pretty much\u000asums up the whole film! Amazing film written by one of the most\u000ainteresting writers of our time. Steven King, who is often known for\u000agiving us fantastical horror stories, brings to the table one of the\u000amost realistic terror tales imaginable. Andy, a banker, finds himself\u000aaccused of a crime, and is sent to prison. There, he is faced with the\u000achallenges of survival while maintaining hope, to one day find his\u000afreedom. In his journey he makes an unlikely bond with fellow inmates\u000aand is able to enlighten them with things they never dreamed possible.\u000aThis is a definite must see film.\u000a

V\u000aThe Shawshank Redemption is one of the greatest movies I have seen in\u000asometime. The first time I saw it was in my Film & Literature class and\u000aI loved it from start to finish. It keeps you thinking and even if you\u000aread the novella, there is changes to it. There are many foreshadowing\u000ain it that could help you figure out what's happening later in the\u000astory and overall. Many film fans should check it out and even later\u000abuy it if you want. The film also has many likable characters as well\u000aand you'll have some of those funny moments (but not a lot). It's a\u000amovie that you'll watch again and again.Stars: Tim Robbins, Morgan Freeman, Clancy Brown, William Sadler, Mark\u000aRolston. Year: 1994\u000a

V\u000aThe Shawshank Redemption is an uplifting, deeply satisfying prison\u000adrama with sensitive direction and fine performances.The screenplay was written by Frank Darabont, who based it on the\u000anovella "Rita Hayworth and the Shawshank Redemption" by Stephen King.\u000aHe adapts the material so well that he really transcends it, turning\u000athe film into a work of art. Many avid readers will claim the book is\u000aalways better than the movie, but that is simply not the case here.\u000aKing is a tremendous writer, but even he can't shade and color the\u000aprison the way that Darabont does, which sets the mood for the entire\u000afilm. The characters King created in the book are deeper and more well\u000adrawn in the film in large part because of Darabont's script. Many moviegoers turn their noses up at the thought of a movie about the\u000atriumph of the human spirit. However, even those jaded film fans will\u000alove "The Shawshank Redemption" because it sets a new standard for\u000afilms in this genre. It is an unapologetically emotional and sometimes\u000asentimental take on friendship and life, even when that life is spent\u000ain a cage, and will make viewers laugh, cry, and reflect on their own\u000alives in ways that very few movies can. It may not have won a single\u000aOscar, but it will win your heart, and perhaps that is more important.\u000a

V\u000aTruly a masterpiece. This is one of those movies which you can watch\u000aover and over again and still find it as moving as the first time you\u000awatched it. This film can not be replicated, because the film is\u000aspecial; the Director wanted to make a piece of art of his film. The\u000amovie has no bad points it's what a story should be about, it takes you\u000asomewhere that you never been, and makes you feel you lived that\u000aexperience, and you can learn from that experience. The lines\u000adelivered, will always be remembered 'Get busy living, or get busy\u000adying' (this is the dilemma we face in everyday live). For this I give\u000athis movie a 10/10 and strongly recommend you to see it.\u000a

V\u000aThis is a different one... at least from the kind of movie I'm used to\u000awatch in sync with friends. Because the 'action' in the plot is around\u000amystery and complex characters. The movie omits most of the stuff so\u000ayou do the work, including the emotional work, and that I value greatly\u000ain a movie. Movies that make you feel and think, that are not obvious\u000aand bogus are the ones you should watch. Directors that don't tell you\u000ain each scene exactly the actors are feeling and thinking... no. You\u000aneed adventures through each history, through realms of thought. Those\u000aare the ones you should watch. I don't want to go deep in the movie to\u000aavoid spoilers, since I write reviews for guys to decide if they are\u000agoing to watch. So here is the tip: If you are looking for fun this\u000amight not be you guy. You will cry and I don't like that when movie\u000asyncing with friends. But if you want to know a history well developed\u000aaround emotion, and some really funny nice characters, or even some of\u000aMorgan freeman then you should do this.\u000a

V\u000aThe Shaw shank redemption is a movie that you should see this movie is\u000aset in the 40s-50s and it's about a man (Tim Robbins) who goes to\u000aprison for something he did not do and along the way Tim meets another\u000aman during the film (Morgan Freeman). I think Morgan freeman is the\u000aperfect actor for this film he was just amazing and I love his voice\u000ait's so good. Anyway about the film it's about two hrs and a half long\u000aand that's a pretty long film. Through out the film Mr robbins does\u000asomethings to change the prison like one scene he makes a huge change\u000ato the library at the prison and he teaches one of the prisoners how to\u000aread and do math equations. Also he does taxes for the guards in the\u000aprison and he loses some good friends along the way and the ending was\u000ajust fantastic I just loved it and the ending goes something like this:\u000aMr robbins has just escaped and is on the beach cleaning up a boat and\u000athen he sees his mate from prison Mr freeman who was let free from\u000aprison and they both see each other on the beach and they run at each\u000aother and hug. Overall I just loved it even though the movie can be\u000aviolent and sad at times i would watch this film again lots of times.\u000aAnyone that has not here is the trailer :\u000ahttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6hB3S9bIaco.

V\u000aOne of the masterpieces of Stephen King that became another memorable\u000amasterpiece for movies (and one of the most underrated films by the\u000aAcademy)."Shawshank Redemption" is one of the most magnificent and beautiful\u000afilms ever made, is not the first time that another work of Stephen\u000aKing becomes a must see classic. Thanks to Frank Darabont, the film\u000abecame unforgettable and also thanks to the magnificent history. Andy\u000aDufresne (Tim Robbins) is a simple and shy bank worker, who after\u000aseeing his wife with her lover, he threats to kill her. His wife and\u000aher lover show up dead in the next day and Andy is sentenced to life\u000aimprisonment in Shawshank institute where begins his great life story\u000awhen he meets Red (Morgan Freeman) and a strong friendship starts\u000abetween this two during the long years of imprisonment. Andy manages to\u000abring many benefits to the prison and the prisoners, but only later\u000athat Andy discovers that his arrest was all a "misunderstanding."The strongest points of the film is the screenplay of Darabont writing\u000aand detailing the film with greater mastery possible by putting us in\u000athe place of Andy and get us feeling the tightness and claustrophobia\u000aof prison. But at the same time with a very well-constructed dialog\u000athat narrates the film without blemish and without leaving any loose\u000aend, leaving the story and his final message in greater perfection. A\u000astory that teaches the value of friendship and strong at the same time\u000aof hope, one of the beautiful things in life and that we can never\u000aabandon it or forget it.Not only the story is absolutely amazing and without any flaws, but the\u000aperformances of each of the cast stand out, Morgan Freeman being\u000aperfect as in all his roles. But who stands out is definitely Tim\u000aRobbins with a show of perfection while maintaining its character as it\u000ais, shy and who keeps to himself and does not try to be anything more\u000athan that.A film that is undoubtedly magnificent, a true masterpiece that should\u000abe watched over and over again to witness this spectacle emotionally\u000abreathtaking classic.\u000a

V\u000a"The true masterpiece" This movie has a quite way defining the life,\u000astruggles, deep happiness and sadness. The director has completely\u000aunderstood the movie and so all his efforts we can see here.Nothing less than a Divine Gift to the World. Once anyone sees\u000adefinitely he is going to repeat it a lot often.Andy Dufresne (Tim Robbins) and Red (Morgan Freeman) both have best\u000aperformances. The best ending scene of this movie I have ever scene\u000ashowing kind of Deja-Vu and Divine feeling to me. It is the movie about friendship and slow-redemption. You might not\u000ablink for a second to see what next it would lead to. Each character is\u000afitted to their roles perfectly and they have given a flawless\u000ajustification to that. A prison life is depicted in this movie which is\u000alooks vivid. I would say that this movie is aptly rated. This movie has a way to\u000atouch your heart by means of showing a true Hope.\u000a

V\u000aThe Shawshank Redemption is a cinematic masterpiece. Firstly, its\u000asetting. The opening aerial shots of the prison are a total eye-opener.\u000aThis is an amazing piece of architecture, strong and Gothic in design.\u000aImmediately, the prison becomes a character. It casts its shadow over\u000amost of the film, its tall stone walls stretching above every shot. It\u000atowers over the men it contains, blotting out all memories of the\u000aoutside world. Only Andy (Robbins) holds onto hope. Andy Defrain\u000aescapes from prison by digging a hole in the wall that is hidden under\u000athe poster of the model. Warden and Brookes commit suicide and Baron\u000agets sent to jail. Lastly, morgan freemans character is set free.\u000a

V\u000aI've seen this film on IMDb so many times before on so many people's\u000alists. But I just ignored it because I thought it was not what I was\u000alooking for. When I finally decided to see it, I immediately regretted\u000anot watching it any sooner. The film is heartbreaking and frustrating from the start, but in the\u000aend, you would truly feel redemption. You could feel the pain and\u000ainjustice brought upon Andy, the protagonist. As I watched the movie, I\u000afelt as if I was in prison with him; I felt as if I've gone through the\u000astruggles that he went through as well. You could see how time is\u000airrelevant in prison; you feel minutes go by when it's actually days,\u000aweeks, months, and years. And then you'll feel disappointed at all\u000athose years where you could have done something different in the world\u000aoutside.The film is also an eye-opener. You open your eyes to what its like in\u000aprison; although, the prison in the movie seems more ideal than real\u000alife prisons. You get a glimpse of brutality and rape inside prison.\u000aYou get to see how some prisoners become institutionalized and never\u000aseem to want to leave anymore. There is also a depiction of how rampant\u000acorruption is, and its sad to think that those involved are the ones\u000awho are supposed to be protecting and abiding by the law.The cast is great. I couldn't ask more from Tim Robbins and Morgan\u000aFreeman. Even the other prisoners are good too. Overall, I think that\u000athe main point of this movie is never to lose hope; that hope is always\u000aa good thing. This movie is as equally good as Forrest Gump and Pulp\u000aFiction (movies that were made in the same year as this), but I can't\u000aunderstand why only these two movies got most of the attention. All in\u000aall, this movie certainly is the kind of movie to watch before you die.\u000a

V\u000aNot really a lot you can you say about this film that hasn't already\u000abeen said. One of my all time favourite films. How Morgan Freeman didn't get a\u000abest supporting Oscar for this film, I'll never figure out.Wonderful, amazingly written film. The cast are superb (Tim Robins\u000aalways underrated as an actor). Pulls you through every emotion. If you haven't seen this film then you\u000ayou don't know what you've been missing. A must have for any movie\u000abuff.It didn't do so well at the box office, but this movies reputation has\u000agrown over the years through word of mouth, showings on television and\u000athen of course along came the video then DVD rentals.\u000a

V\u000aThis film is brilliant, just brilliant. I watched this film expecting\u000ajust a normal movie but when it ended I knew it would stay with me\u000aforever. Every decade has one or two groundbreaking movies, the 70's\u000ahad The Godfather and Apocalypse Now, the 80's had Platoon and Raging\u000aBull the 90's had The Shawshank Redemption and Pulp Fiction and the\u000a2000's had Gladiator and The Lord Of The Rings. There were a lot of\u000agood films in the 90's and this is up there with the best . The story\u000ais about a man called Andy Dufresne (Tim Robbins) who is wrongly\u000aconvicted and sent to the Shawshank Prison. When there he meets Red\u000a(Morgan Freeman) and then the story takes off. The acting is incredible\u000aand Freeman and Robbins deliver the performances of their career, the\u000ascript is incredible (another great collaboration between Steven King\u000aand Frank Darabont) and it didn't win one single Oscar! This could have\u000abeen good enough for three Oscars at the least, true, the competition\u000a(Forrest Gump and Pulp Fiction) were good films but, The Shawshank was\u000acertainly good enough to win a couple.So if you haven't seen The Shawshank Redemption, buy it, rent it and\u000awatch one of the most powerful and moving films ever, be prepared to be\u000ablown away.\u000a

V\u000aThis has got to be one of my favourite films of all time. I first saw\u000ait when it made it to British TV and have only just got round to buying\u000ait and i've watched it a few times since then.The characters have so much depth, you end up loving them the more you\u000awatch this film. The acting is first class. The cinematography is first\u000aclass. The sound is first class. The casting is first class. The\u000adialogue is fantastic. All these elements and more make this a riveting\u000awatch and you end up wishing the film could be longer.This is one of the few times i've seen a film after reading the book\u000athinking the film is an improvement. It seems to me it expands a little\u000aon Stephen King's novella.This film deserves the rating it has here on IMDb\u000a

V\u000aShawshank Redemption narrates a beautiful story of two prisoners\u000abonding over the number of years. Their experiences in the prison and\u000athe chemistry between two (Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman) have been\u000ashot with terrific care.Editing and Screenplay of this movie are among\u000athe best in any movie you will see. The credit goes to director on shaping the movie in such an interesting\u000away and the ending of the movie is arguably among one of the very\u000abests. One might feel the movie is a bit slow at times, but you are\u000aalways into the plot which brings on new surprises consistently. Overall, this is the sort of movie you will remember for long time and\u000aa benchmark among the "feel good" movies. MUST WATCH.\u000a

V\u000ait is the most great film in the history of American cinema. Robbins\u000aand freeman are fantastic. it implants hope in our soul. friendship\u000arelation between the Robbins and freeman in the film is very nice. i\u000aknow that movie is the first in the IMDb schedule , and its really\u000aworth it. When I watch any movie I always return to your appreciation\u000aof it and relied upon, but in this film I've seen just so, I said it\u000adeserved to be the best and when I returned to the evaluation have\u000areally found is also.But I do not know why did not achieve high income\u000awhile movie display, but perhaps it was due to have been introduced in\u000athe early nineties of the last century, and the film does not usually\u000aattracts young researcher substance or sexual violence.\u000a

V\u000aI have written a few reviews on IMDb and Shawshank is one of my\u000afavorite movies of all time. I don't necessarily think this movie was a\u000a10 but an easy 9 for me. I am giving it a 10 because of the negative\u000areviews that I read with saying they gave this movie a 1 just because\u000aothers had given it a 10. As far I'm concerned it's mine to give, if I\u000awant to to give every a movie a 10, (which by the way I don't). I am\u000ajust sick of people telling me that a movie can't be great because it\u000awas story driven and not character driven, maybe I like story driven\u000amovies, I certainly liked this one. So here's another 10 for you movie\u000asnobs will have to eradicate.\u000a

In order for Andy to help the young man cope with\u000aprison as Red is really used to it having lived there for years.Red is also a smuggling expert at contraband and gives people\u000acigarettes, posters of Rita Hayworth to Andy among other things. As\u000apeople at the prison look up to him. Red has also been denied parole so\u000amany times he looks at getting parole as useless along the way.Both must deal with the harsh reality of prison. As both need to lean\u000aon one another to survive.

In the process, Andy is moved from\u000athe laundry job.Andy works with the corrupt warden Sam Norton(played evilly by Bob\u000aGunton), and corrupt and sadistic guard Captain Hadley(Clancy Brown),\u000ain the prison library and fixes taxes and money laundering for them\u000apersonally.Andy is placed in solitary confinement a couple of times, once for\u000arefusing to not keep on money laundering for the warden.

V\u000a"Every mind has billions of ideas and each one of us do things that no\u000aone expects us to do, some of those things are visible, some not but\u000aone of those things that make our life worth living is FREEDOM"Tim Robbins stars as Andy Dufresne, a young man who faces a long, long\u000atime in prison after he is wrongfully found guilty of murdering his\u000awife and her lover. While inside he learns an awful lot about what a\u000aman can hold onto and let himself be put through if there is still an\u000aounce of hope in his soul. Bottles of cool drink on a hot rooftop, a\u000aslowly building library collection, the moment of musical joy that sees\u000aDufresne severely punished for his overstepping of the mark and many\u000aother scenes spring to mind as classic moments in a movie almost chock\u000afull of classic moments. Andy quickly gets befriended by "Red" (Morgan\u000aFreeman), actually the narrator of the story, both soon prove that even\u000ain the worst circumstances, within the "hell on earth" they can\u000amaintain human dignity and strive on their own way to freedom... Morgan\u000aFreeman is the film's secret strength, playing "the guy who can get it\u000afor you" with a note of welcome ambiguity. Watching him in an early\u000ascene, when a fat, new convict (fresh fish) is being beaten by cruel\u000ahead guard Captain Hadley (Clancy Brown), you don't know whether Red\u000alooks so crestfallen for the victim or for the packs of cigarettes he\u000ajust lost betting the guy wouldn't break before Dufresne James Whitmore\u000awas equally memorable as a prisoner who was unable to adjust to the\u000aoutside after his parole following a 50 year stint. This shows that\u000apeople who have been incarcerated for such a long period, need some\u000asort of readjustment training before they rejoin society. For Whitmore,\u000afreedom meant ultimate doom, making the scene one of my all-time\u000afavorite displaying the ultimate dark side and a certain fear in\u000afreedom. Tim Robbins, Morgan Freeman along with James Whitmore etched\u000aunforgettable performances as prisoners charged with crime. The film\u000ashows what prison life is all about. Subjects dealing with prison\u000asurvival, brutality, corruption and ultimate redemption are well shown.\u000aAn outstanding film dealing with prisons as seen by several prisoners.\u000aMany social problems are discussed here. The picture earned a\u000awell-deserved best picture Oscar nomination. It certainly should have\u000atied with the winner, the equally good "Forrest Gump."My Rating - 10/10\u000a

V\u000aThe story as a whole is incredibly done, everything from the camera\u000awork to the choice of words used. I also love how each character is so\u000aunique and well developed. So many small adjustments are made\u000athroughout the film, to the characters make up for example, which makes\u000athis such a well finished film. I highly recommend this to anyone who\u000awants a brilliant film. 10/10. (side note, this is my only 10/10 film)It is an emotional and thrilling film which has many plot twists. I\u000afeel like this is one of the greatest movies every made, and i have\u000amany good reasons to think this.-Sean\u000a

V\u000aReally, after all this time, why write about Shawshank now? Well,\u000asimply, it's still the best movie I've ever watched.... 10 times. This\u000ais a movie that from start to finish keeps you engaged like no other\u000afilm. When it concludes you wonder how a 2 hour plus movie can go by so\u000aquickly. No bathroom breaks or snack breaks during this movie, whether\u000ait's the first time watching it, or your tenth. Just sat down and\u000awatched it again 2 nights ago with my daughter (12). She too never\u000amoved from the couch and loved the film. This film will hold up to the\u000atest of time because it's simple: great writing, great acting, great\u000adirecting and watchable over and over.\u000a

V\u000aYes! it's absolutely true.Recently I had gone to a DVD shop. I found\u000athis movie and bought it. SHAWSANK REDEMPTION is a never before never\u000aagain movie. One man is accused by murder case that he did not do that.\u000aafter he becomes a prisoner. in that prison another man finds him and\u000athey becomes close friends. but that man never loses his hope to be a\u000afree man. he makes his all prison life to find a solution to live as\u000afree man in the world and he does some things to ensure this to come\u000atrue. then he finds and makes his life absolutely free. This amazing movie was directed by frank darabont with original story\u000aby stepen king. afterwards this movie was nominated for seven Oscars\u000aincluding best picture. but won nothing. I don't hesitate to say it's a\u000aevergreen movie all time in everyone's life.\u000a

V\u000aFinally I Watched "Shawshank Redemption." Well, Last night I watched a\u000amovie which has most un-believable rating on world's most trusted movie\u000arating site, IMDb with a rating of 9.3 by more than 800,000 votes\u000a(yes!). I's indeed very overwhelmed & enthusiastic about the movie.(you\u000aknow, that much publicity takes the excitement to the extreme level)\u000aNow, talking about the movie, it is a story of a man who gets life\u000aimprisonment sentence for a crime which he didn't commit. Here it\u000aremembers me about the classical Russian novella named 'The Kreutzer\u000aSonata' by "Leo Tolstoy". It seems to me a bit inspired from that.\u000aIndeed. The rest of the story line is different. It specifically a\u000astory of a man's struggle (in which he got succeed) to come out of the\u000aprison (by hook or crook, take it your own way) and proved himself\u000ainnocent after the hard sufferings of 19 years imprisonment. The whole\u000astory tells about the moral to heed i.e. "Hopes Never Die." I really\u000acan keep this movie on my All-time favorite movies list. It deserves\u000aso, Btw. This is some of among those movies in which I didn't check the\u000aduration even a single time. And, during the whole movie I was just\u000asitting on the edge of my chair with wide open my eyes & my mind (off\u000acourse). And, for now, with classiness of this movie in my brains & off\u000acourse terrible sleep in my eyes, I'm no more in situation to write\u000aanything else. But one thing I'd make sure that very soon I'm gonna\u000aread 'Stephen King'. And, At the last I'd like to halt my review by one\u000aof the dialogues of the movie, Which I liked a lot, "Get busy living or\u000aget busy dying." And, I'm really nowhere an obtuse to just review it\u000alike a blind-head Ass. Lol :) Remember Hope is a good thing.\u000a

V\u000aI absolutely love The Shawshank Redemption. When a movie gives me\u000agoosebumps, it has done its job. Where to start. The acting in this\u000amovie is sublime. I had never seen any movie starring Tim Robbins, but\u000aMorgan Freeman is one of my favorite actors. Tim Robbins portrays an\u000aintriguing man. He and Morgan Freeman work together extremely well.The story itself is brilliant. A banker, wrongfully put in prison would\u000anot seem that interesting, but with these people and their\u000aconversations and companionship it's certainly worth a watch. I was sad\u000awhen I thought the director killed off Andy Dufresne at the end, but\u000awhen I realised he had actually escaped I couldn't stop smiling until\u000athe movie was over. This movie certainly deserves the #1 spot in the\u000atop 250 movies, as it's a must see for everyone.\u000a

V\u000aWhat can i say, its shaw shank. I don't refer the film as the shaw\u000ashank redemption i call it shaw shank as everyone knows what I'm on\u000aabout when i say its my favourite (and i only seen it in April 2012).\u000aThe story is well known as Andy dufrense is wrongly accused of a double\u000amurder and sentenced to shaw shank prison where he meets red (played by\u000athe awesome Morgan freeman). Over time in the movie he adapts to life\u000ain prison and escapes and becomes a free man. How did a movie this so\u000asimple become beloved by so many. How? I don't know how and i don't\u000acare but this film is basically a beginner for any filmmaker and\u000aalready became a success years later. Although it did not great at the\u000abox office yet critics praised it well, years later people discovered\u000ait on VHS. I wished i seen this film earlier as a teenager as it would\u000ahave struck to me even more through a time i felt depressed and sad. A\u000adiscovered this movie in the local library and rented it as i heard of\u000athe film being very good and after seeing it, it is more than just\u000agood. I may be over-exaggerating this brilliance of the film but it\u000aunlike many other films (except the lion king of the return of the king\u000ahit me right in the soft spot). I didn't cry at the end, i smiled at\u000athe end. What a film.The good of the film, the acting from freeman. Although he lost to\u000ahanks in Forrest gump for best actor, i don;t care as hanks did as much\u000aas a good job as freeman did (if better). Tim Robbins was also amazing\u000aand likable with the supporting cast doing perfection to the highest\u000alevel. The score is beautiful, the mies en scene, the scripting writing\u000ais gold and genius making this a classic. This film is not complex and\u000ait is something that makes it just so darn good. The pacing is perfect\u000aand the narration from freeman is timeless. The iconic shots of Andy\u000araising is hands in the air after escape is timeless as and should be\u000aattempted when finishing school (as i have did).A film highly recommend by me and others as well, touched me to the\u000apoint of joy and laughter and will bloom your day as it always will\u000alive as cinemas most beloved classic ever. 5/5\u000a

V\u000aWhenever I see a prison or even think about it, the first thing that\u000acomes to my mind is this film. Maybe it's because I have watched this\u000amasterpiece so many times that it's actually made a place inside my\u000ahead and will never go away. I just cannot explain how well this film\u000ais made. The direction and screenplay by Frank Darabont and the fact\u000athat it is based upon "Rita Hayworth and Shawshank Redemption" by\u000aStephen King makes it highly likable. Moving on to the performances by\u000aTim Robbins as Andy Dufresne and Morgan Freeman as Ellis Boyd "Red"\u000aRedding, they shine just like a diamond, stupendous performances by\u000athem. I still can't believe that it never got any major accolade and\u000adidn't even make much money but still it has developed into something\u000asensational which can't be missed.\u000a

V\u000aI have three framed posters of my favourite films on my wall. On the\u000aleft is 'The Dark Knight' and on the right is 'The Lord of the Rings:\u000aThe Return of the King'. These are the best films of their outstanding\u000atrilogies and, in my opinion, are the greatest films of my generation.\u000aI have watched each countless times because they're filled with action,\u000asuspense and tension and also incorporate a sense of overcoming that\u000awhich seems impossible to overcome.Then, purely because it was rated highly, I watch a film not of my\u000ageneration, on a free DVD from the Sunday Times. Without special\u000aeffects or a large budget, The Shawshank Redemption became my third\u000aposter because it exceeds the qualities TDK and ROTK have in abundance. Each are excellent. Shawshank's better.\u000a

V\u000aI'll keep this short and sweet. I am not the type of person who reads\u000acritique reviews and determines whether that will make me watch a movie\u000aor not. However, I didn't think I would ever want to see this movie\u000aafter seeing the preview and a friend said it was a bit slow. I have to\u000ahonestly say that I was impressed by the directing, acting and overall\u000astory. This is a great move! You should defiantly take the time out of\u000ayour life to see a great movie that is not a superhero remake. This\u000astory has structure, purpose and meaning. Though, if you can't sit\u000astill then don't bother. However, I do think it's time we get some\u000aculture back in our lives.\u000a

V\u000aI can't figure out how a man could think such an outrageous concept\u000alike that!Its just beneath all the beautiful thing.Thanks to Frank\u000aDrabount,Morgan Freeman,Time Robbins.Excellency is sky high in this\u000afilm.Not a movie,its just a lifetime experience.Sometimes people felt\u000ato sad ,they curse themselves,regret for everything they have done in\u000alife.They crush for success,run after money.But,here is the thing that\u000achanges everything and it is indeed "The Hope".No matter how bad you\u000afeel,no matter how hard the path of the life is,the show is still goes\u000aon if you have just one thing and that is "The Hope".Life would\u000acertainly changes if peoples take the deep meaning of this wonderfully\u000aexecuted movie.Probably It will help many people to start their life\u000afor the second time!!Hats off to everyone who worked with the Shawshank\u000aRedemption Team..\u000a

V\u000aWhat can I add to all the other reviews here? Just my own feelings\u000aabout this. I now realise I watched the film in one of the hardest times,\u000aemotionally, I can remember in my life. Thoughts chasing themselves\u000aaround in my head, heartbroken, paranoid and not well physically. Total\u000amess.My dear female friend who got me through it all told me this was a film\u000ato watch. I initially resisted, thinking it was going to be\u000alightweight, PC fare. I don't know why I thought that.There's a lacklustre opening sequence -I think. Then you get to see\u000awhat kind of performance Morgan Freeman is going to turn out this time,\u000aand you start to be interested. Then this extraordinary scene flying\u000aover the prison, and I think by then you're hooked.This scene is deeply moving, not least because of the music. It's\u000adifficult to see how Thomas Newman's music for this film could possibly\u000abe bettered - perfectly listenable to in it's own right, but when you\u000ado you're reminded of the boys on the roof in the sun, enjoying their\u000afirst beer for so long. They've been touched by Andy's kindness. Sometimes a kindness is thrown\u000aback in one's face, but other times a gesture of gratitude is given\u000aback - like Haywood getting up and offering Andy one of his beers - and\u000aa powerful connection is made. The film is full of great hardships and unbearable sadness - surely\u000ascars that can never completely heal or be forgotten. But it is also\u000afull of joy and fun and hope. To capture all the above in a film is a\u000atriumph. I started watching the film fairly closed to feeling, but as I\u000awatched the end I could not contain my tears, unusually.So a moment when a film came along at the right time for me, and no\u000adoubt for many others\u000a

V\u000a"I have been thinking for a while to watch " Shawshank\u000aRedemption"(1993) the number one movie on IMDb list 9.2/10,finally did\u000ait, its a excellent example of good story telling ,one of the story\u000athat makes u think and touches your soul, this movie is all about hope\u000a,hope in bad times & not letting it go whatever is the situation ,hope\u000athat one day u will have your laugh,hope to be loved again,hope to\u000aachieve something big,hope to breath free. Andy Dufresne (Tim\u000aRobbins)not only was hopeful for himself in the his bad time but made\u000ahis prison mates hopeful by providing them feel of freedom through\u000abooks and music,he also gave his best prison mate Red (Morgan Freeman)\u000areason to live once he made it out from the prison. and as Tim Robbins\u000asays "hope is one of the good things and good things never dies".\u000a

V\u000aThe greatness of this film is in its excellent presentation and\u000aarticulation of what lies deep within a human being that makes him/her\u000apersevere against impossible odds, especially so when he/she is facing\u000aa terrible injustice. This reminds me of Viktor Frankl's book 'Man's\u000aSearch for Meaning' based on his experiences in prison under far worse\u000aconditions than depicted in this film. It is only under the harshest\u000aand most extreme of circumstances that a sensitive and just human being\u000awhose integrity is under attack will almost certainly face the question\u000aof the meaning of his/her life and in general the meaning of life and\u000athe meaning of freedom. The only real freedom that human beings have\u000alies in a creative response to the impossible but challenging\u000acircumstances that one faces, and in that creative expression one finds\u000ameaning. No one can give that freedom and no one can take away that\u000afreedom  its source is within, and completely independent of external\u000acircumstances and institutions. All institutions tend to inhibit this\u000afreedom and instead 'confine' individuals so that they become\u000a'institutionalized'. The prison is the toughest of all institutions.\u000aBut the tougher the conditions, the greater is the challenge and if\u000aunderstood that way, the greater the rewards in finding meaning. But\u000auntil that is accomplished, one must have something essential and\u000asubstantial to believe in  call it hope or faith or self esteem  in\u000aorder to survive, for nothing is accomplished in death. At the same\u000atime, the idea of death itself is the motivating force  a sense that\u000aone could die without having achieved anything in life is the most\u000apowerful life sustaining force itself  this is the most stupendous\u000aparadox of human existence, something that was hinted at in Joseph\u000aHeller's Catch 22. At the centre of this catch is the hope (a word much\u000aabused) that one will find meaning even in the most hopeless of\u000aconditions, that one will be able to forge something good out of the\u000aentire BS that surrounds us. And that which is good lasts forever. That\u000ais the true faith, not the false faith of the corrupt Warden, who in\u000athis case is not only the proverbial 'devil who is fond of quoting from\u000athe scriptures' but also gives the airs and appearances of one who is a\u000a'man of God' only because of his fanatical devotion to the Bible. The\u000airony of it all is brought out superbly near the end. The ending was\u000athe best part in a way because this story was no hopelessly fated\u000a'Greek Tragedy', as the central message of the film was that hope\u000awithin one man can light up the hope in another who otherwise would\u000ahave given up, and that this evocation is a very powerful bond between\u000ahumans, in this case between two very different kind of humans, both by\u000abackground as well as race, but who become the best of friends because\u000athey share something vital deep inside that makes them 'to get busy\u000aliving' rather than to 'get busy dying'. Finally, what makes this one\u000aof the greatest movies is that it also has drama, adventure and action\u000awhich makes it appealing to a wide audience. For the serious, it can\u000arevisited several times for the special kind of mood that it evokes  a\u000amood that is both uplifting as well as thought provoking.\u000a

V\u000aBest movie I ever saw. It's a pinnacle in humankind's endeavor in film\u000amaking and unbelievably without any special effects or fanfare. It's a\u000astory about normal human beings. Direction, screenplay and acting all\u000aare mind-boggling. Equally mind-boggling is how can this movie not get\u000aan Oscar even after considering that jury at Academy awards makes huge\u000amistakes sometimes(remember "Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon"). In my\u000amind I've no doubt that even if "Avatar", "Titanic", "Return of the\u000aKing" and "Ben Hur" were all released in same year as this movie, the\u000aOscars for best film, best direction, best actor and best supporting\u000aactor should all go to this movie. I've become a huge fan of Tim\u000aRobbins (he is brilliant in "The Mystic River" too) and Morgan Freeman.\u000aAlso, let's not classify it as a prison movie since it's in a class of\u000aits own. It exhausts all superlatives. If you haven't watched it, watch\u000ait now. Who knows the world may end tomorrow :-).\u000a

V\u000aThis title has to be one of the greatest films ever made. It is a\u000atouching story of a man who is sent to prison for life for the accused\u000amurdering of his wife and her lover. The story is so captivating and\u000acompletely differs from other prison films because of its heart.A defiant masterpiece which makes you enthralled within it from the\u000avery beginning. Brilliantly acted by Tim Robbins and, of course, Morgan\u000aFreeman as always. Brilliantly directed, scripted and the original\u000ascore was very, very good.I have watched it three times in the last year and I still can't get\u000aenough of it. A defiant worth wile watch.\u000a

V\u000aDecided to check out IMDb topper as a time pass and was i glad i\u000adid.One watch and "The Shawshank Redemption" has been added to my all\u000atime top movies...The golden year of '94 which gave the world some of\u000athe best films of all time didn't disappoint with this one...The cast\u000awas superb...Tim Robbins is amazing and Morgan freeman again shows why\u000ahe is at the top.The bond between the main characters is well developed\u000aand the climax is mind blowing.The movie gives genuine inspiration and\u000ais more than suitable for repeated viewing when one feels down.I give\u000ait full 10/10 as it gives u more than a regular film does.It shows the\u000aimportance of hope in life and why one should never loose it.The\u000aTagline tells it all - "FEAR CAN HOLD YOU PRISONER,HOPE CAN SET YOU\u000aFREE"...\u000a

V\u000aThe Shawshank Redemption is undoubtedly the best best movie ever. The\u000aOscar's biggest mistake was giving Forrest Gump the awards that\u000aShawshank deserved. Not to take credit from Forrest Gump which is also\u000aan amazing movie, but it just can't compare to Shawshank. Morgan\u000aFreeman arguably delivers his best performance and Tim Robbins gives a\u000aperformance that I feel is greatly underrated, and also deserved an\u000aOscar nomination. The films art direction adds to the story's beauty,\u000aand gives off a feeling that fills you with hope. I remember seeing The\u000aShawshank Redemption on sale for $5 at Wal-Mart and thinking "I heard\u000athis is good" so I bought it. Little did I know the film was worth more\u000athan gold. I bought the film and put off watching it for a couple\u000aweeks, not overly anticipating watching it, but finally decided to\u000awatch it when I was bored. I am a gigantic movie buff, and have so many\u000amovies it's almost pathetic, but The Shawshank Redemption changed my\u000aentire view of film. Now, every time I watch a movie I can't help but\u000athink "It can't beat Shawshank." Some people say that this movie is\u000aoverrated, but that's wrong. Shawshank is an actual work of art, to be\u000acompared with works of DaVinci and Picasso. When people say this movie\u000amakes them cry, they don't mean to say it's so sad, but that they\u000adidn't know that something of such beauty could be conveyed on screen.\u000aI believe that if everybody see's only one movie during their life, it\u000ashould be this one. See it now. After that, IMDb will seem like a whole\u000anew website because every film will seem like a different movie. It is,\u000aby the very definition of the word magnificent.\u000a

V\u000aAwesome movie, Based on the Stephen King novel, Shawshank Redemption is\u000aa delight from first scene to last. The opening is a brilliantly done\u000asequence with Andy's (Tim Robbins) trial inter cut with his actions on\u000athe night of his crime.Tim Robbins plays Andy Dufresne, a man convicted of double murder who\u000ais sent to jail, eventually befriending other lifers including Morgan\u000aFreeman's Ellis Redding. Exceptionally handsome adaptation of Stephen\u000aKing's short story "Rita Hayworth and Shawshank Redemption" (in the\u000afilm version, it's really Raquel Welch, not Rita, who aids in the\u000aultimate twist). On the surface, it's another prison-genre picture with\u000athe usual stereotypes such as a rotten warden, a cruel guard, a few\u000ahomosexuals, and a quirky old-timer who doesn't want his parole.\u000aHowever, the film's emotions run surprisingly deep, justice is well\u000aserved by the conclusion, and several of the cast members carve out\u000aamazing, three- dimensional characterizations.\u000a

V\u000aI'll always remember watching this film when i was younger, it was one\u000aof the first films that ever gave me that 'mind-blowing' experience you\u000asometimes get when you've seen a brilliant movie. Tim Robbins gives\u000awhat is undoubtedly for me his best performance as Andy, who is such an\u000ainspiring character that you find yourself truly rooting for even in\u000athe early stages of the film. Morgan Freeman gave a stellar\u000aperformance, arguably his best also, as Red, Andy's cell mate another\u000acharacter you grow to love during this wonderful piece of cinema. This is a film i will never tire of, if you haven't watched it for\u000awhatever reason, you should do! A solid 10/10 for me! enjoy.\u000a

V\u000athe Shawshank redemption should be played throughout the world in all\u000aschools to teach people the hard life of prison but the bond between\u000afriends and the idea of hope. Morgan freeman is a second to none actor\u000ahe lays the role perfectly and i could not think what the film would be\u000alike without him. all the other actors perform perfectly. this movie is\u000aa movie of inspiration and one of which will get people through harsh\u000atimes. this film always restores my faith in mankind i simply love it.\u000aI first saw this film sitting on my brothers desk and i was intrigued\u000aby the idea of a film set in prison where hope and other morale values\u000awere the storyline instead of violence and havoc, this is a amazing\u000afilm which brings pride to the actors and crew who produced it. the\u000asetting of the movie is one of perfection the Gothic grounds and the\u000astunning facilities astound me i'am finding it hard to put in to words\u000ahow much this film means to me i would say it is one of the greatest\u000afilm's ever made in my time and i love it.\u000a

V\u000aThis movie was released when I was all of 9 years old. Lucky for me, I\u000adidn't come across it until nearly 13 years after the fact. I have\u000aalways been a movie buff and, aside from that, a big fan of the\u000awritings of Stephen King. I had read the short story the film is based\u000aon and it led me to this film, which I was certainly aware of prior but\u000anever checked out. Afterwards, I had a new list of benchmarks for\u000acertain aspects of cinema.First and foremost was the story itself. The writing of this tale, in\u000ascreenplay form, is absolutely brilliant. The story is fleshed out\u000awithout lingering in certain areas it would have been easy to linger\u000ain, and the pacing of the film is steady and constantly building\u000aemotional atmosphere. From the early feelings of confusion and bitter\u000ajustice (as our main character is judged by his peers) to the dawning\u000arealization of what Shawshank Penitentiary has to offer for it's masses\u000aof convicted felons. It all flows fabulously, as the tale unwinds from\u000athe darkest despair of prison life into the slowly building and\u000apalpable hope Andy and Red seem to cultivate for the rest of the\u000aprisoners. It's this humanity in the face of inhumane conditions that\u000ais at the forefront of The Shawshank Redemption's impact.Second, but just as vital, was the casting. Tim Robbins has always\u000abeen, in my mind, a criminally underrated acting talent. He always\u000aseems to carry a sense of outward vulnerability that belies an inner\u000astrength, and in that conflict one always questions his motivation, his\u000areason for doing things. His skill set was married perfectly to the\u000acharacter of Andy Dufrense, who instantly seems in mortal danger within\u000athe walls of Shawshank but eventually rises above the concrete and\u000asteel. Indeed, it's safe to say that, mentally at least, Andy spent\u000avery little time in that prison.Morgan Freeman played the role of Red Redding in a manner that, I\u000athink, no other actor could have done. He was not only a veteran of\u000aShawshank, he radiated a sense of calm wisdom and strong sense of\u000abrotherhood amongst his fellow inmates that lend themselves very well\u000ato Freeman's on-stage abilities. As a "man who can get things", Red is\u000ainstrumental in many inmates' lives in Shawshank. Offering a variety of\u000acontraband items in return for the typical currency of incarcerated\u000apeoples (cigarettes, petty cash), Red is as important a character as\u000aAndy in terms of the film's overall message of hope despite\u000ahopelessness. And Morgan Freeman was the best man for that job.The excellent acting doesn't end there. Bob Gunton, who seems to find a\u000aniche in playing white-collar criminal types, portrays the warden of\u000aShawshank as a sinister, scheming man who hides his darker desires\u000abehind the Bible and an arrogant, holier-than-thou attitude. William\u000aSadler is another outstanding character actor, similar to Gunton, whose\u000aface is more popular than his name and who does a fine job as Heywood.\u000aOne of the more important supporting roles was that of the hard right\u000ahand of the warden, Guard Officer Hadley, who was portrayed by Clancy\u000aBrown, well known for his bad-ass-type roles. His no-nonsense,\u000ahard-edged persona fits well and leaves you hating his character but\u000aappreciating his ability to make you hate someone who doesn't exist.Beyond the writing and the acting, this movie was perfect in every\u000aother aspect. I've seen it many times over the years, often turning to\u000ait, perhaps subconsciously, during particularly rough or depressing\u000apatches. I've very rarely come across a film that not only meets my\u000aexpectations, but exceeds them in a way that leaves me constantly\u000acomparing future films to it. The Shawshank Redemption is one of those\u000afilms, where the outstanding story and the remarkable talents of\u000aeveryone involved combine to bring vivid fiction to life. A masterpiece\u000aof modern film-making that has lost none of it's impact or relativity\u000anearly 20 years later.\u000a

V\u000aWhat is there to say about this movie, except it is a triumph in film\u000amaking. First of all anything narrated by Morgan Freeman you know is\u000agoing to be a great movie. A story of a life behind bars with no end,\u000athis ordinary man turns Shawshank prison up side down. I think the fact\u000athat this movie is so simple is also the reason it is so great. There\u000ais no complicated cinematic techniques or special effects, just men\u000atalking to each other. Tim Robbins shows us that the good guys can win\u000aeven when their livelihood has been taken away. Its the kind of movie\u000athat just makes you smile on the inside and lets you appreciate the\u000asimple things even if just for that day. The Shawshank Redemption is\u000adefinitely a movie everyone should see, only if just to brighten your\u000aday. But I think in the future it will prove to be an important mark in\u000acinematic history.\u000a

V\u000aAs of March 2012, Frank Darabont's The Shawshank Redemption is sitting\u000apretty on the "IMDB Top 250" list with 731,886 ratings averaging at\u000aabout 9.2/10. That's astounding. On Rotten Tomatoes, a site much more\u000acritical where it is a rarity that new movies possess a "fresh" rating,\u000athe film has merited a 90%. Another commendable achievement. I bring\u000athese two facts up because I'm just amazed at how high the film is\u000aranked. Here's a film that holds the "IMDB Top 250" list by a long\u000ashot, yet doesn't immediately come to people's mind when thinking "the\u000abest movie of all time." Of course, being on the "IMDB Top 250" doesn't\u000aqualify as an official listing. Being featured on AFI's list is more\u000arespectable, but still, it is subjective. Just a bit more broader and\u000astronger, since a group of high intellectuals choose the films. If one\u000alooks further down the "Top 250" list, you'll see a number of\u000aquestionable entries such as The Dark Knight, Inception, and Toy Story\u000a3. Their presence doesn't necessarily mean they're the best - just the\u000ahighest rated by people.But I have no quibbles about Shawshank's placing on the list; it is a\u000awonderful, wholesome parable about redemption and reassurance of one's\u000aself worth while locked inside a penitentiary. We are met with\u000acharacters who are trying to escape the confines of a monotonous\u000alifestyle in prison, bot mentally and physically, and find a rare\u000aamount of comfort when with each other. The film is adapted from\u000aStephen King's short story, Rita Hayworth and Shawshank Redemption - a\u000anovella that isn't so much physical suspense and horror as it is\u000apsychological horror; a different route for King, an author who has\u000afocused so much on the supernatural and the victimized outcasts in his\u000along career.We are placed in Shawshank State Penitentiary, located in Maine in\u000a1947, where Andy Dufresne (Robbins) is convicted of murdering his\u000acheating wife and her lover and is given two life sentences. Andy\u000aassures he is innocent, but circumstances prove differently. He meets\u000aEllis Boyd "Red" Redding (Freeman), a man too serving life, who acts as\u000aa con man who can get you anything you want as long as you give him his\u000aasking price plus 20%. At first, Red doesn't think too much of Andy,\u000abetting ten cigarettes with his buddies that he'll cry the first night\u000ain prison.Andy doesn't cry. He seems rather content, despite the treatment and\u000ahell he has been through. As time passes, by time I mean years and\u000aeventually decades, Andy's relationship with Red grows. They become\u000aunderstanding of each others positions, and Red takes a rare liking to\u000athe man. So do many other prisoners. At first, Andy is a victim of\u000amistreatment and abuse from his villainous and heartless prisoners, but\u000ahe eventually keeps his head held high, and works out deals with Warden\u000aSamuel Norton, who is played by Bob Gutton in a scarcely recognized\u000aperformance that is equal parts frightening and breathtaking, to do\u000aodd-jobs around the prison to earn money, but more importantly,\u000arespect.Not only do the prisoners become smitten with him, but the guards,\u000apolicemen, and suits alike. They admire his persistency. There comes a\u000atime where Andy desperately wants more funding for Shawshank, not just\u000afor bars, guards, and walls, but for books and to assimilate growth for\u000athe feeble and decrepit library currently in the prison. The guard\u000atells him that he can write as many letters as he wants but the state\u000agovernment won't pay any mind. So, Andy patiently writes one letter\u000aevery week to try and convince them why extra funding is vital.Here's where the spoiler comes in. The film's main morals are optimism,\u000aself worth, and hope. The film's tagline perfectly spells out its\u000aidentity; "Fear can hold you prisoner. Hope can set you free." There is\u000aa character in the film named Brooks (Whitmore), who is the prison\u000atrustee. Upon being released from the penitentiary, Brooks commits\u000asuicide by hanging himself. The reason was because he never had any\u000asort of dreams or plans. Never any vision of hope or compassion for\u000aanyone. He was just a human being living in fear. Andy succeeds because\u000ahe has learned to carry optimism on his shoulders. He eventually\u000ateaches Red the same lesson.The spoiler's over. Moving on, the film illustrates the passing time,\u000awhich I mentioned was decades, beautifully and naturally. The film will\u000aseem long to some, but it shows how slowly the prison life plods along.\u000aHow mundane and redundant it must get to get up, confined to small\u000arooms, and work for very low wages every day. And you thought your\u000acorporation job was miserably insufferable.But where Shawshank really excels is in its humanism. It evokes\u000aprisoners as people, with morals and livelihood. Not as monsters. It is\u000atrue, many, many people in prison deserve to be there, but we never\u000alook past the caricature of a psychopath or a deviant when we think\u000aabout what kinds of people are really in there. They're not all bad\u000apeople. People who question me on that should contemplate long and hard\u000aon this question; is Red a bad person? Or even a monster? The Shawshank\u000aRedemption is a marvelous journey through parts rarely explored. It is\u000aimmersing in not only its characters and story, but in its touching,\u000alight cinematography which projects a wide range of dispositions\u000athroughout the entire excursion. Rarely does a film rub us this way,\u000aand rarely does one seem to rub everyone the same way. All the more\u000areason, its placement on the "Top 250" really isn't an exaggeration.Starring: Tim Robbins, Morgan Freeman, and Bob Gutton. Directed by:\u000aFrank Darabont.\u000a

V\u000aIt has a formula that gives you this kick; Darn what a good movie! But\u000aI need to say this, sometimes it happens.. So WHY do people love this\u000amovie and rate it high, when, or WHY isn't the "smart" people declare\u000ait like a a peace of art? Or do they?! Still I think it's darn\u000agood...but I bet the producer(s) didn't expect that!Like when we vote, for anything, we need to follow our heart. This is a\u000atypical movie that is worth every penny, every letter... and it's a\u000atypical 90' movie! Oh.. there we have it! Between gone with the wind\u000aand now, we NEED this!

V\u000aI saw this movie for the first time 8 years ago. I just happened to see\u000ait by chance on cable because I never heard about "The Shawshank\u000aRedemption" before. After watching the movie I was immensely impressed\u000aand positively surprised. Definitely this is the best movie I've ever\u000aseen. The story, the direction and the cast (Specially Tim, Morgan and\u000aGil Bellows) are perfect! The Shawshank Redemption really deserves that\u000aspot in the rankings. This movie is a "must see"! The movie not only offers a great viewing experience but also a lesson\u000ato take home. Wish more movies are made in this fashion instead of the\u000ablood and gore that people seem to appreciate nowadays.Thanks for reading this review.\u000a

V\u000aShawshank redemption is probably one of the greatest movies out there\u000ahands down. Its a story about a banker named Andy Dufresne who is\u000asentenced to life in prison for killing his wife and her secret\u000alover.At first for Andy it seems that life has taken a toll for the\u000aworst while he goes through the first initial weeks in\u000aShawshank.Fortunately he befriends a group of the inmates over the\u000acourse of his time there. Mainly a character named Red who has some\u000apush on things that go down in the prison. Red and Andy learn a lot of\u000alessons from each other and become really great friends over their\u000acourse of time at Shawshank. The dialogue in this movie is not only\u000aenticing, but also has a bit of comic relief here and there. To me this\u000amovie mainly revolves not only the character development of Andy as a\u000aman sent to jail for life, but mainly about the human condition and\u000awhat it is like to no longer be a free man. Andy's' most important\u000alesson that he learns in Shawshank is that while they can take\u000avirtually everything away from you including your pride and your\u000adignity, they can never take your Hope.\u000a

V\u000aIf there was such a thing as a perfect movie, this is it. Of course,\u000afor practical reasons, one cannot award a film ten stars out of ten,\u000abecause of the endless stream of new work demanding scrutiny. I'd like\u000aalso to start by quoting another well known film, which sums up my\u000aopinion nicely. 'In many ways, the work of a critic is easy- we risk\u000avery little, and thrive on negative criticism, which is amusing to\u000awrite and to read. But the harsh truth of the matter is that the\u000aaverage piece of junk is probably more valuable than our criticism\u000adesignating it so'. This could not be closer to the truth. When it\u000acomes down to the wire, critics risk everything in dishing out praise,\u000afor fear of being ridiculed themselves.There can be no such danger with The Shawshank Redemption. It is an\u000aeternal masterpiece, timeless and inspiring. I avoid being clichéd,\u000awhen it is at all possible to do so, but The Shawshank Redemption is\u000abeautiful, masterfully acted, with just that right amount of\u000atenderness. This is a tale of moral courage, and the everlasting fight\u000afor justice. As with other films of the genre, one can tell what will\u000ahappen, of course, but when you watch this film, you will time and\u000aagain be genuinely surprised, and maybe even shed a tear for the\u000apersistence and unquenchable thirst of the human spirit. One leaps for\u000ajoy after watching this incredible film, at the knowledge that evil, in\u000aall senses of the word, can, and will never triumph.Turning an eye to the technical side of things, just for a moment, I\u000acan discern not one single badly executed shot. The Shawshank\u000aRedemption is well written, and, as I have said before, brilliantly\u000aacted. Characters that could be flat are all allowed to develop and\u000aflourish, and the film is even better for it. The film grabs our\u000aattention, right from the word go, with agitated shots of Andy looking\u000alike he IS going to kill his wife. And the soundtrack. Well, there\u000aisn't much to say; except that most of the music in this film is some\u000aof the most beautiful I have ever heard.This is a deeply satisfying, wonderful, brilliant, fantastic, soulful\u000acinematic work. Watch it, if you haven't seen it, and if you have, you\u000amust agree that this excellent film will be an eternal classic. There\u000aare, of course, films that people will prefer, I myself am strongly\u000aattracted to Subway, a 1985 film by Luc Besson, but for pure facial and\u000aobjective value, cinema does not get much better than this.\u000a

V\u000aIf you want to see hope in its most poetic and dramatic sense, choose\u000aThe Shawshank Redemption. I commend it to everyone who thinks movies\u000aare more than source of 'entertainment',that they are mirrors of life\u000aand its moral lessons. I cannot find any other movie with such\u000acompelling touch of hope, faith and love. You will understand what\u000aredemption is, you will understand what a Fountain of Hope can do, if\u000awe let it reign inside of us.From the production, to the timing, to the script, and the acting of\u000aeach character, The Shawshank Redemption gave justice to its box-office\u000atitle. It may have not won Best Picture but for me, it is the Best\u000aPicture by far.\u000a

V\u000aLet me start out by saying that this is one of my personal all time\u000afavorites and as such I may be a bit bias whole reviewing it. On the\u000aother hand, there's a reason it's a personal favorite. The movie revolves around the wrongly imprisonment of Andy Dufrane\u000a(played by Tim Robbins) for the murder of his wife. The story focuses\u000aon Andy's life in prison, relationships with other inmates\u000a(particularly with "Red" played perfectly by Morgan Freeman) and\u000apassion for life and freedom. I recently had an argument with one of them regarding this movie. He\u000aclaimed it was "too plain" to be considered so great; my view was (and\u000ais) that it maybe be plain, but it's superb. The movie touched me when\u000aI saw it, Brooks' long life in prison (amazing acting by James\u000aWhitmore), Red's pragmatic persona and Andy's unyielding will and hope,\u000aall combines to an amazing movie.In my opinion this isn't some regular "feel good movie", it's much\u000amore. It may be plain as my friend said, low on visual effects or\u000aoutstanding camera work  but it's plainly superb. The texts send\u000ashivers down your spine, Frank Darabont's screenplay adaption to\u000aStephan King's short story are brilliantly executed by the amazing cast\u000aand in the end that's what really matters.I was moved when the movie ended, viewed it and prison differently, I\u000aexpect it'll remain as a cult favorite despite the "no impressive\u000aeffects and mediocre camera work" as my friend put it.Go watch it if you haven't already, it's in my opinion one of the best\u000amovies of all time.\u000a

V\u000a94 was such a great year for movies, we had cult classic's like Forrest\u000aGump, Pulp Fiction & Speed, But I always thought out of all those..\u000aShawshank was a movie which didn't get the recognition it deserved from\u000acritics and viewers alike. Call me a snob I don't think you cannot call\u000ayourself a movie buff, unless you've seen this movie.The plot revolves around an innocent banker sent to prison charged of\u000amurder of his wife and befriends an old friendly character portrayed\u000aperfectly by Morgan Freeman. Andy Dufriene is a eccentric prisoner and\u000awhen you live his life (visually of cource) it defines what solace\u000areally is. Happiness and sorrow.This movie is definitely worth a buy without question, so do yourself a\u000afavour and purchase it ASAP!\u000a

V\u000aPlot: Andy Dufresne (Tim Robbins) is a banker, convicted of a murder he\u000adid not commit and sent to Shawshank prison. After two months of being\u000athere, he meets Red (Morgan Freeman) 'a man who knows how to get\u000athings'. The warden (Bob Gunton) uses Andy's banking skills for his\u000ascams and turns out to be more ruthless than he thought. Andy spends\u000atwenty years in prison before his legendary escape.This is said to be the best film ever made. I can see why. It is\u000adefiantly my favourite film of all time. Some say it is too over rated\u000aand that might be true but there's no doubt it is a fantastic and well\u000aexecuted film. The acting is good. Morgan Freeman is an excellent\u000anarrator. William Sadler is also good. You can't help but laugh with\u000aHaywood.The Shawshank Redemption is a brilliant story of, hope, friendship and\u000aobviously redemption. It also has a way of connecting with the viewer's\u000aexperiences. People relate their own life to the film and it helps\u000apeople deal with bad moments it their lives. This is not a film to\u000amiss.\u000a

V\u000aI avoided seeing this film for years because I thought it was a grim\u000aprison uprising tale from Stephen King. Well, I was one third right, it\u000ais set in a prison but it is a very good story about friendship,\u000ahonesty, forgiveness/redemption, patience and loyalty. I'm going to\u000areally try and not give away too much of the film because if you\u000ahaven't seen it yet, you are missing out on a great story. It's set in\u000aa prison in the late 40's. Some of the inmates have been there since\u000athe early part of the 20th century and with repeated parole denials and\u000ano rehabilitation in sight, many have been institutionalized and have\u000alost hope and even lost sight of their own identity. When one such\u000ainmate is released, he walks into a world that he barely recognizes. He\u000atries but in the end, fails to make it in the real world and succumbs\u000ato desperation and hopelessness. We see some of the guards greedily\u000ataking part in violence that is so vicious that it is difficult to\u000adiscern the prisoners from the prison staff. But, ultimately it is a\u000atale of redemption and the story unfolds with hardship, humor and\u000agrace. This is a film that I will see again and again.\u000a

V\u000awhat a narration..???,One of my all time favorites. Shawshank\u000aRedemption is a very moving story about hope and the power of\u000afriendship. The cast is first rate with everyone giving a great\u000aperformance. Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman carry the movie, but Bob\u000aGunton and Clancy Brown are perfect as the Warden Norton and prison\u000aguard captain Hadley respectively. And James Whitmore's portrayal of an\u000aelderly inmate Brooks is moving. The screenplay gives almost every\u000aactor at least one or more memorable lines through out the film. As\u000awell as a very surprising "twist" near the end that almost knocked me\u000aout of my chair.\u000a

V\u000aEDITEDIn 1946, a banker named Andy Dufresne (Tim Robbins) is convicted of a\u000adouble murder, even though he stubbornly proclaims his innocence. He's\u000asentenced to a life term at the Shawshank State Prison in Maine, where\u000aanother lifer, Ellis "Red" Redding (Morgan Freeman), picks him as the\u000anew recruit most likely to crack under the pressure. The ugly realities\u000aof prison life are quickly introduced to Andy: a corrupt warden (Bob\u000aGunton), sadistic guards led by Capt. Byron Hadley (Clancy Brown), and\u000ainmates who are little better than animals, willing to use rape or\u000abeatings to insure their dominance. But Andy does not crack: he has the\u000ahope of the truly innocent, which (together with his smarts) allow him\u000ato prevail behind bars. He uses his banking skills to win favor with\u000athe warden and the guards, doing the books for Norton's illegal\u000abusiness schemes and keeping an eye on the investments of most of the\u000aprison staff. In exchange, he is able to improve the prison library and\u000abring some dignity and respect back to many of the inmates, including\u000aRed. Based on a story by Stephen King, The Shawshank Redemption was the\u000adirectorial debut of screenwriter Frank Darabont.what a spectacular movie it is. i remember seeing this movie when i was\u000aa child but couldn't remember much of it so i decided to watch this\u000amovie now once again. people are not crazy when they think it is one of\u000athe best movies of all time. almost half of the world population might\u000ahave seen it, maybe the second most loved movie after The Godfather.one of my very most favorite movies of all time, one of the best movies\u000aever made, a highlight of 1994. this truly is an Masterpiece, a pure\u000awork of genius. a near perfect classic movie. a movie that will never\u000aget old, a memorable movie. will always be remembered. it was nominated\u000afor 7 Oscars unfortunately didn't won any, Best Picture, Adapted\u000aScreenplay, Cinematography, Editing, Sound, Original Score and Actor in\u000aa Lead Role Morgan Freeman. Best Picture that year wen't to Forrest\u000aGump.story of this movie just so wonderful with so much to say in layers. it\u000ais story of Tim Robbins as Andy who is been falsely accused of murder\u000ais being jailed in Shawshank, there he meet Morgan Freeman as Red, he\u000aand other cellmates becomes friend. Andy is a weird and unique inmate\u000athere which when i found what he did or was doing just shocked me, he\u000ais jaw dropingly genius. he becomes a personal banker to a corrupt and\u000avery cruel warden sameul played by Bob Gunton and his other men. he\u000asecretly works on his own legal case while he is educating and trying\u000ato improve lives of his other cell mates, he makes them read and study\u000asince he himself is an educated man. he escapes from jail too in the\u000aend, which is an epic scene to me.this movie stars Tim Robbins, Morgan Freeman, Bob Gunton, Bill Sadler,\u000aClancy Brown , James Whitmore , Gil Bellows , Mark Rolston , Jeffrey\u000aDeMunn , Dion Anderson , Ned Bellamy , Bill Bolender , Larry\u000aBrandenburg , Brian Brophy and others. Tim Robbins gave a good\u000aperformance, just like he did in Mystic River but this time you may see\u000ahim smile too. i like his performance, did justice to his character. i\u000aliked him when i saw this movie first. then there is Mr. Morgan Freeman\u000aas Red which according to me was a 100% perfect casting, he was very\u000agood in his character, delivered a very good performance. this movie\u000aoverall features good performances. and i like both the characters of\u000aboth Andy and Red, memorable characters they are. and also their\u000achemistry was so good in this movie.Directed by Frank Darabont whose only movie i remember after this one\u000ais The Green Mile and TV Series The Walking Dead. he really did a good\u000ajob in this movie, superb work indeed. truly impressive. screenplay of\u000athis movie is excellently written. superbly executed. you will love the\u000away this movie grows on you completely and completely takes over. i was\u000ahooked to this movie. Editing of this movie was really good. good\u000acinematography and art direction. just a good of everything. good score\u000atoo ofciurse.this is one of the best prison movies, a truly heart touching,\u000ainspiring, uplifting thought provoking, timeless, sad movie that will\u000abe loved by every person with a soul in them. a very moving movie. i\u000aloved it truly, very lovable movie that i don't even need to recommend\u000ait to you. Most of you have seen it but if by any chance not, THE A\u000aMUST MUST WATCH.\u000a

V\u000aI Watched the movie 16 years after its release. I must admit that i\u000awatched it out Of curiosity for its being on the top of the IMDb list.\u000aI wasn't disappointed. Rather felt a sense of victory. It doesn't have\u000aany action sequences or any romance or Anything of the sort. But it is\u000aone of those films that makes you feel Happy inside and yet sad that\u000ayou may live many more years and watch Tons of movies but never feel\u000athe same climax or emotion that you get Out of this movie. This movie\u000ahad the most powerful cast and amazing script, and all based on an\u000aawesome prison drama novel by horror-master Stephen King!Andy Dufresne (Tim Robbins) is sent to Shawshank State Penitentiary in\u000a1947 for the cold-blooded murder of his wife and her lover. Over the\u000anext 19 years, he does what he can to stay above the mire, consisting\u000anot only of the cruelty of his fellow inmates but the heavy hand of a\u000abrutal warden, Norton (Bob Gunton), a sadist who thumps his Bible while\u000atelling his charges that "salvation lies within." Andy's stubborn\u000arefusal to give up hope in the face of his incarceration engenders the\u000awonder and friendship of several inmates, especially "Red" Redding\u000a(Morgan Freeman), who nevertheless wonders about Andy's state of mind.Robbins depicts Andy Dufresne to be a reserved, humble protagonist. It\u000ais well-known that other actors were considered to play this role, such\u000aas Tom Hanks, but I believe Robbins's presence works wonders for the\u000astoryline, allowing Andy to have a quiet temperament that lets him seem\u000aat peace with himself. He has nothing on his resume close to his\u000aperformance here. Freeman puts on arguably the greatest performance of\u000ahis lifetime in this movie. His narration lets the viewer connect even\u000afurther with all the characters, and has a poignance that stays with\u000ayou long after the credits roll. His "rehabilitated" speech ranks right\u000aup there as one of the all-time great movie moments.Character development is greatly utilized here. Pop culture references\u000a(Rita Hayworth, Hank Williams, John F. Kennedy) help give one the\u000aimpression of the passage of years, and Andy's brave, witty exploits\u000amake him a likable hero. Violence and death are also put to use, with\u000aseveral characters dying within the story. We are made to embrace these\u000aseemingly real individuals during their airtime, and are hence moved by\u000atheir tragic deaths. The failures of these characters make the final\u000ascenes of the film all the sweeter.Another standout feature of The Shawshank Redemption is the music. Oh,\u000athe music! Thomas Newman's musical score shines brightly and lends\u000aanother dimension to this heartfelt tale. The triumphant piece heard at\u000athe end is one that you've likely heard before  as it has been used in\u000amovie trailers all over the world. The fact that The Shawshank\u000aRedemption did not win an Oscar for its musical score (or in any\u000acategory for that matter) is almost incomprehensible. Though in a '94\u000aclass along with Forrest Gump, Pulp Fiction, and The Lion King, I\u000asuppose it can be understood.I will note that it is a definite 'must see' for all those who consider\u000athemselves "movie connoisseurs". There are not too many negatives (if\u000aany) that can be said on the film. I will state, however, it's current\u000a#1 ranking on the IMDb Top 250 is a little bit high though.I guess I'm a little nit-picky, but my main beef is with the ending.\u000aThe whole movie is about hope. *SPOILERS ALERT* If you wanted hope,\u000athen you should not have ended on a cheesy last scene where the old\u000afriends reunite and everything is alright. *SPOILERS END* It was\u000atouching, no doubt about it, but then the message of hope is dwarfed by\u000aour excitement that the two friends are together again. We leave the\u000amovie smiling instead of thinking. What I'm trying to say is that to\u000amake the core message stick to the viewers, the movie should have ended\u000athe scene before, when Red boards the bus and says, "I hope I can make\u000ait across the border. I hope to see my friend and shake his hand. I\u000ahope the Pacific is as blue as it has been in my dreams I hope." And\u000aas the bus drives away from the camera, the credits roll. But again,\u000athat's only an honest opinion.Watch this film alone and with attention and it will really get you\u000ainvolved and thinking and thats the beauty of it. I recommend it to\u000aeveryone who enjoys watching beautiful cinema. I rate it 9 out of 10.For the end i leave Andy Dufresne's quote "Hope is a good thing, maybe\u000athe best of things, and no good thing ever dies"\u000a

V\u000aStephen King's powerful prison drama story is brought to life, with\u000aFrank Darabont's "The Shawshank Redemption". The movie tells the story\u000aof Andy Dufresne, portrayed brilliantly by Tim Robbins, who is sent to\u000aShawshank prison, when framed as the murderer of his wife, and her\u000aaffair lover. During his time in prison, Andy makes an unlikely\u000afriendship with smoke dealer "Red", portrayed by the astounding Morgan\u000aFreeman, who does an excellent job of guiding the movie with his\u000asmoothing, and confident narration. Now, the rest of the movie talks\u000aabout Andy's struggle to try and break free from Shawshank, and the\u000aunexpected friendship between two different people. This movie is an\u000aastounding masterpiece, that can only be spoken through the words of\u000athe mysteriously defying Stephen King. Director Frank Darabont helped\u000abring King's vision to life on the screen, and he performed an\u000aexcellent job as a director, and a writer. Also, the cast is such a\u000atrue miracle, that the movie was able to get the finest actors to play\u000athe most finest cinematic roles. Tim Robbins is excellent, Morgan\u000aFreeman is astounding, Bob Gunton is brilliant, and James Whitmore\u000aplays such a dramatic small role as "Brooks", the Shawshank librarian.\u000aAlso, I enjoyed Thomas Newman's breathtaking score, the perfect\u000acinematography, the excellent use of film editing, and the spectacular\u000ascript. I respected every single moment in this movie, and it had me\u000awanting for more. "The Shawshank Redemption" is one of the best movies\u000aever made, and I have never seen a movie with so much heart before,\u000aeven though of it's slow 142 minute run-time. "The Shawshank\u000aRedemption", in my review, "a stunning masterpiece, entertainment at\u000aits finest".\u000a

V\u000aWhat can be said that already hasn't been. Shawshank Redemption is a\u000aspectacular film which focuses on Hope and fear. Morgan Freeman does\u000awhat he always does, delivers a fine, unforgettable performance. With a\u000avoice like that it extremely hard too. As Red, Freeman narrates the\u000atale of how a man wrongly accused of Murder, is sent to life in prison\u000aand has nothing but hope to cling on.Stephen King epitomise great storytelling. You don't need twists every\u000ascene nor do we need a complex plot that tries to hard to stand out.\u000aWith colourful characters and fantastic interactions, a story can truly\u000abecome personal. OK, many here has probably never been sent to prison\u000afor something they didn't do but this doesn't stop anyone from\u000aimagining the fear and hopelessness that one must go through when\u000astripped from their freedom and rights.There only few films out there that makes the most out off every shot.\u000aShawshank is one of those. There not one wasted second, no scene which\u000acould or should of been cut from the final version. Everything is done\u000ato perfection. You can feel and sense the delinquency and effort put\u000ainto the film which luckily for us, makes the viewing that extra\u000aspecial.Pointless it may seem, writing a review for a film which has already\u000abeen critique to death, but heck, a little more praise won't do any\u000aharm. Yes, you will get your snobs who will bang on about how this film\u000adoesn't deserve to be number one, but those are the ones who believe a\u000astory must be plagued by thought provoking twists. All i have to say is\u000athat Shawshank is a heart warming tale that will no doubt leave you in\u000aa fuzzy ball of warmth and amazement when the credits begin to roll\u000adown on this extraordinary tale\u000a

V\u000a"The Shawshank Redemption" isn't only a movie these days; it's a\u000astatement of purpose for underdogs and anyone who ever felt trapped\u000aunderfoot by a system they didn't understand. Yet watching the film\u000awith that knowledge doesn't obscure the fact it is a highly satisfying\u000aemotional thrill ride worth taking again and again.Andy Dufresne (Tim Robbins) is sent to Shawshank State Penitentiary in\u000a1947 for the cold-blooded murder of his wife and her lover. Over the\u000anext 19 years, he does what he can to stay above the mire, consisting\u000anot only of the cruelty of his fellow inmates but the heavy hand of a\u000abrutal warden, Norton (Bob Gunton), a sadist who thumps his Bible while\u000atelling his charges that "salvation lies within." Andy's stubborn\u000arefusal to give up hope in the face of his incarceration engenders the\u000awonder and friendship of several inmates, especially "Red" Redding\u000a(Morgan Freeman), who nevertheless wonders about Andy's state of mind."Hope can drive a man insane," Red warns Andy. "It's got no use on the\u000ainside." Andy doesn't agree.It's true what other commenters say: You can't pass two-and-a-half\u000ahours much more quickly than by watching this. There's enough\u000acleverness, good humor, and uplift to power five Hollywood\u000ablockbusters, and terrific acting from the stars to the day players.\u000aBased on the Stephen King novella, "Rita Hayworth And Shawshank\u000aRedemption," it's the gold standard of King adaptations thanks to the\u000apowerhouse work of writer and first-time director Frank Darabont, who\u000auses Freeman's narration to inject King's voice into the proceedings.Robbins is a great lead, physically towering over the rest of his cast,\u000ahis quiet authority reminiscent of James Stewart, whose famous film\u000a"Harvey" Dufresne even references at one key moment. But Freeman is the\u000afilm's secret strength, playing "the guy who can get it for you" with a\u000anote of welcome ambiguity. Watching him in an early scene, when a fat,\u000anew convict ("fresh fish") is being beaten by cruel head guard Captain\u000aHadley (Clancy Brown), you don't know whether Red looks so crestfallen\u000afor the victim or for the packs of cigarettes he just lost betting the\u000aguy wouldn't break before Dufresne."Shawshank" is otherwise not ambiguous at all. The bad guys are vile,\u000ajustice is served up on a heaping platter, and a final scene is too\u000aon-the-money for its own good. But the ride getting there is so true\u000aand natural, so minutely well calibrated with its lived-in details,\u000athat you can't really deny this film's classic status, nor want to.\u000aIt's a deserving King Of The Hill for the IMDb 250.But why is it so highly regarded beyond that, as a film whose message\u000atouches so many so deeply? Like so many others, I think the notion of\u000aShawshank prison as a metaphor for life has much to do with it, the\u000aidea that however dark and embroiled in life's miseries we become, its\u000abelief that "a warm place without memory" is not out of reach pulls us\u000ain. You can see a religious message in such a notion if you are so\u000ainclined, and many are, yet the film is clever enough to work on other\u000alevels, too.Finally, it's a great story, well told. People will always have a need\u000afor such stories, especially when the things they tell us are as fine\u000aand noble as they are here. Andy wants out of "Shawshank" bad, but for\u000aviewers it turns out being a fine place to serve time in.\u000a

V\u000aStephen King is my favourite author and I like most of his books and\u000alove some as well. One of the defining features of his books is the\u000acharacterisation and the atmosphere. No one does it better. This leads\u000ato his books being long and slow some times but that's the part of it.\u000aThis normally doesn't transfer well to cinema where everything is cut\u000aand compressed. This movie is better than the book. I read the book and\u000aI was impressed I saw the movie and I fell in love with it.The movie focuses on the two main characters and the side stories\u000aenhances their character brilliantly. All what comes before ties in to\u000athe end. One of the greatest effect in the movie along with the\u000aatmosphere is the soundtrack. It plucks at you, it pulls at you and it\u000alulls you in to a world where all that you see flows with it, smiles\u000awith it and cries with it.I wont talk about the story since now after so many reviews we are at a\u000astage where we can talk about other features of this movie. There are\u000amany great moments in the movie including the two stage ending, both\u000astages immensely enjoyable every time for different reasons. Another\u000agreat moment for me is the release of Brooks Hatlen from prison. His\u000adialogue delivery (the world went ahead and got itself in to one BIG\u000aDAMN hurry) and acting is brilliant at that moment and is perfectly\u000acaptured further ahead in the movie when Red facing similar\u000acircumstances confesses, "Terrible thing to live in fear" The same\u000afear can be glimpsed when Red glances fearfully over a stone wall in\u000aBuxton to see if he is being pursued or spied upon while he reads a\u000aletter. (Great acting and direction) This movie is about hope and friendship. Those of us who have seen it\u000amany times, enough to even forget the count are touched by it every\u000atime. We now see the movie in its entirety and every magical scene is\u000aimpressed upon our memory because this is art. The message of eternal\u000ahope is wonderfully characterised in Andy and that of friendship in\u000aRed.\u000a

V\u000aThere are very few films that leave me in tears and make me reflect\u000aupon life in an extremely meaningful and profound way, and by God if\u000aShawshank hasn't been the best. Speaking as quite a young film enthusiast, I prefer more modern films\u000ain general; I can appreciate the classics in their period of release,\u000abut I think that we need to move on in order to advance and become more\u000asophisticated in art. I see people reeling off their favourite films\u000afrom decades past, past horror films, action films etc, and I think the\u000astandard of films has risen so much over the past few years that the\u000aonly thing that makes some the classics seem tolerable is nostalgia.\u000aWatch 'The Exorcist' or 'Star Wars' now and although you can see why it\u000awas so popular, compared to their modern-day equivalents they don't\u000aexactly blow your mind. This may seem naive, but I detest the notion\u000athat because something was done first, it must be the best at it - we\u000alearn from the past to move forward. But watching Shawshank, I wouldn't\u000amind if things stayed that way. There is nothing wasteful in this film\u000aat all. Every single line, expression, scene and shot has significance\u000ain the message that overrides the whole production. I'm just gushing now and I haven't even said much about the film, but\u000athe fact that I was made to consider all this and then be compelled to\u000awrite about it, is proof enough of this film's worth. No matter who you\u000aare, or where you come from or what you like, Shawshank will touch you\u000a- it will make you laugh, cry and marvel at such excellence that is\u000anothing short of film-making perfection. No-one reads the reviews for this film other than to confirm what they\u000aalready knew - that this film is a masterpiece, and that it demands\u000arecognition, so if by a minute chance you are reading this without\u000awatching it, erase this review from your memory and watch it fresh\u000aeyes. I thought this film was going to be a mediocre-fest that snobbish\u000acritics drool over because of the word 'Redemption' in the title. And\u000athat's the best way to watch it. Underestimate it, so that when it\u000ablows your mind you can sit back and slap yourself in the face for not\u000aalready having seen it. And if you didn't feel that way after seeing, I\u000asuppose you can just go back and re-watch Michael Bay's Tranformers for\u000athe fifteenth time.\u000a

V\u000aI have this film on DVD and it's one of my favourites. That said, it's\u000abeen several years since I sat down and watched it and I hoped it was\u000astill as good as I remembered. It might be worth pointing out here that\u000aI've been a huge Stephen King fan since I was at school, probably a\u000agood 30 years all told. I have every book in general circulation, and\u000aI've read a lot of them more than once. Different Seasons must have\u000abeen one of the first books of his that I bought when it first came\u000aout, way back in '82 or '83. It's a collection of four unrelated\u000anovellas, other than that each title has a different season mentioned\u000ain the subtitle. The first of the novellas is Rita Hayworth and\u000aShawshank Redemption: Hope Springs Eternal, and it is, in my opinion,\u000aby far the best. If you haven't read it, I would thoroughly recommend\u000ait, particularly if you haven't seen the film as the movie stuck pretty\u000aclosely to the original story so there won't be many surprises in store\u000afor you otherwise. Incidentally, if you've ever seen Rob Reiner's movie\u000aStand by Me or Bryan Singer's Apt Pupil you'll find two of the other\u000astories in the collection pretty familiar too. But I digress, back to\u000athe movie in question.I wasn't disappointed. This is undoubtedly a great movie and thoroughly\u000adeserves it's place at the top of the list. The performances from Tim\u000aRobbins & Morgan Freeman are superb and the friendship between their\u000acharacters develops over 20 years or so is entirely believable. You see\u000athem, particularly Freeman, get gradually broken and institutionalised\u000aas the film plays out. And then, of course, you get that fantastic\u000afeel- good ending that you really wanted, but somehow never actually\u000aexpected. But it's not just the performances from Robbins and Freeman\u000athat delight. Both Bob Gunton, the sadistic and greedy warden who\u000asomehow believes he is doing God's work, and Clancy Brown (remember him\u000aas the Kurgan in Highlander?) as the equally sadistic, almost\u000asociopathic Captain Hadley, give wonderfully sinister performances.Most of the other prisoners, with the possible exception of James\u000aWhitmore's Brooks, are fairly two-dimensional, but then the director\u000aalmost seems to gloss over them deliberately to keep the viewer's\u000aattention firmly directed towards the two leads and their developing\u000abond.The film begins in the 1940s, and continues on until the 1960s so it\u000awas essentially a period piece when it was made. This has stopped it\u000abecoming dated in any way. Also, because it's set in a prison which\u000aappears almost completely isolated from the outside word, the passage\u000aof time is easy to miss. The movie is as engrossing now as it was 15+\u000ayears ago when it was first released. At two and quarter hours, it's\u000aprobably one of the longer films in the list (although by no means the\u000alongest), but it keeps the viewer's attention for the full duration,\u000aand never seems to lose its sense of direction. Every scene pushes the\u000aplot forward in some way.A definite 10/10 from me, and thoroughly recommended.\u000a

V\u000aMovies simply do not get better than this.Inspiring, captivating, intense, funny (at times), tragic (at times).\u000aInteresting and thrilling.Every aspect of this movie is perfection: the acting, story, dialog,\u000aproduction, setting, cinematography, etc... all perfect.This film is truly flawless.I could not describe this movie as "fun" but I would describe it is\u000aunparalleled in its excellence- and not in some stupid artsy sense-\u000ajust plain and simple it is story telling at its finest.If you haven't seen this movie, you absolutely need to watch it right\u000anow. Fantastic. I wish I could give it a higher rating than 10 out of\u000a10 stars.\u000a

V\u000aThe first time I watched this film I was on a coach heading to the\u000afrench Alps in year 8 of school. I loved it from the first moment. A\u000afew weeks later when I discovered the title of the film I went out and\u000abrought it, (or more correctly had it brought as I wasn't old enough).\u000aIt remains one of my favourite films in my collection.Why do I think this is one of the best films ever, it comes down to the\u000atelling of a great story, in a great way, by great actors. From the\u000amoment the film begins your sucked in, the audience is made to connect\u000awith the events we see on screen thanks to the soulful voice of the\u000agreat Morgan Freeman, he has the ability to help us relate with events\u000aand almost forget we are watching a film, but instead listening to a\u000astory from a much loved grandparent. When he speaks the audience\u000adefinitely listens.However Morgan is by no means the star. The less well known but equally\u000atalented Tim Robbins, his performance of Andy Dufresne, is in my\u000aopinion one of the all time greats. The way in which the character\u000aattempts to retain dignity and his humanity, instead of being twisted\u000ainto the archetypal convict is reason enough for this film to be in the\u000aIMDb top 250. The way at which Dufresne strives to improve his and the\u000aother convicts leaves you with a taste on the honourably of the\u000acharacter, or his rebellious acts toward the Warden just to provide the\u000ainmates with a piece of music is a scene which you remember just\u000abecause of its shear brilliance. Which reminds me big thanks to Steven King for writing the book this\u000afilm was based on, you did good, like you normally do.No one could review this film without mentioning James Whiymore who\u000aplays the tragic figure of Brookes, the old lovable inmate. The sad\u000atale of the man who had spent his life in prison and dies in freedom is\u000athe emotional heart of the film, I feel sad every time I watch it.\u000aJames Whitmore was truly a great actor, this film proves it. Th story never gets tedious no matter how many time you watch it, and\u000aif its your first time watching be set for a treat.The best thing I can say about this film is watch it, and the only\u000aproblem you'll have is trying to get across to your friends exactly why\u000athe need to see this great piece of cinema\u000a

V\u000a..voice of total respect for this movie.Everything is absolutely fantastic in this master piece. Casting,\u000aacting, photography, music, sounds, feel, atmosphere, screenplay, all\u000athat is beyond good, it is perfect. Whole movie is immersed in such a\u000adelight it really helps if you are feeling down to lift you up. And\u000athat is what movies should be all about. Not about damn effects and 3d.\u000aAs many said before it really lift your spirits up. It gives such a\u000aprofound feel of hope and happiness, and beyond. And there is another great value of this movie. It proves that\u000asometimes in this lifetime Hollywood is capable to create master piece.\u000aIt is one but that one speaks for thousands of those we do not get to\u000asee. No effects, no damn computer graphics, no faster then light action\u000ascenes, and yet after watching it you feel million times better than\u000aany other movie.It deserves 11 stars.\u000a

V\u000aYou know it's really not the most entertaining movie ever made. you\u000amight look around the theater and see people yawning or even sleeping i\u000aguess it's not avatar where you get CGI things or these 3D animation\u000amovie they make these days nor any batman or superman thing to thrill\u000ayou with the action. What makes this motion picture special is that you\u000awill grow to love this movie , the first time you walk out of threatre\u000ayou may not think of it as the greatest movie ever made , but there's\u000asomething about it which makes you see it again and again and each time\u000ayou see it you learn something new from it. you may be impressed by\u000athese great budget movie they make these days but you surely wont watch\u000ait a hundred times literally. Count my words you will watch this movie\u000athat many times. It's a story about hope as many people have already\u000asaid in the review also about friendship and almost all these great\u000ahuman emotions. Great great soundtrack by thomas newton is like a\u000acherry on the cake.The movie is so realistic and so much real at places it actually makes\u000ayou angry, yet it's not a depressing movie like schindler's list or a\u000afairy tale one like forrest gump , it's just a story which gives you\u000ahope and strength to face life and value it. believe me lol i have\u000awatched a lot of movies and this IS THE BEST ONE.\u000a

V\u000aOff the hop, I don't mean to upset people with a 9 out of 10 rating. In\u000amy world, nobody gets a 10; there is always room for improvement. Mind\u000ayou, this movie comes very very close to a 10.I knew nothing of the movie before watching it and was picking my jaw\u000aup off the floor upon completion. The amount of situations and\u000aexperiences I could relate to and empathize with was incredible. The\u000asimplicity of the message within the complication of human interaction\u000aand misunderstanding. It was a shocker. The extent of rawness people\u000acan portray towards each other versus the compassion was wound together\u000alike yin and yang. We can't really have one without the other.Since, I have seen this movie several times. Each time, I still find\u000asomething new to ponder if it was intentionally placed, or just happens\u000ato fit.I highly recommend this movie to believe in the power of the human\u000aspirit and magnitude of motivation brought on by friends.\u000a

V\u000aIn 1995, when I was fourteen, out of the blue, I saw in a newspaper,\u000athat one of my favorite Stephen King stories, Rita Hayworth and the\u000aShawshank Redemption, had finally made its way to the silver screen.It wasn't showing at the Hoyts/Greater Union cinemas, rather a local\u000aindependent/art-house cinema. Of course, that didn't bother me so I\u000awent. Over 2hours long, Shawshank swept you into another world. Stephen\u000aKing's short-novel was very faithfully adapted. Three pieces of\u000abrilliance stood out then, and still do today. 1 First, the film was brilliantly paced, never a dull moment. Having\u000aread the short-novel before hand didn't diminish any expectations. 2 Second a brilliant cast. Sheer brilliance from Morgan Freeman, and\u000aTim Robbins, as Red and Andy Dufresne. Very strong supporting cast in\u000aBob Gunton - the cruel Warden Sam Norton, other inmates: Gill Bellows\u000aas young Tommy Williams, James Whitmore, the elderly Brooks (brilliant\u000aexpansion of character, that short novel only dealt with in two\u000aparagraphs). Yet the show was stolen by Clancy Brown. Brown's legendary\u000aperformance as Captain Bryon Hadley, one guy you clearly didn't want on\u000ayour case! 3 Finally what remains in my mind the most, from Red's last\u000aparole-hearing, to the end of the film. Words can't simply convey the\u000aemotions, this was what I didn't except. It was so powerfully done. My\u000afavorite quote: Andy Dufresne: "Get busy living, or get busy dying. "\u000aEnough said.\u000a

V\u000aYou go into a film hoping to be entertained. That's the least you can\u000aexpect. If a film manages not only to entertain but also to inspire\u000athen you've really got something. Such is the case with The Shawshank\u000aRedemption. Few movies are as inspiring and uplifting as this tale\u000aof...an innocent man rotting away in prison? Well that doesn't sound\u000aparticularly inspiring. Sounds depressing even. But this movie will\u000asurprise you. At times along the way it is rather bleak, things seem\u000ahopeless. But the movie's hero never gives up hope. He is not content\u000ato sit in prison and rot. Get busy living or get busy dying. Is there\u000aever really any doubt which of those options Andy Dufresne will choose?In 1947 Andy, a banker on the outside, is sent to Shawshank State\u000aPenitentiary for life after being wrongly convicted of murdering his\u000awife and her lover. He befriends a prisoner named Red, a man popular\u000aamongst his fellow inmates because Red is the man who can get things.\u000aMost of the men want the typical prison contraband. Cigarettes are the\u000abig item. Andy's different. He wants a tiny little rock hammer to\u000amaintain his rock collection. And later he asks for a Rita Hayworth\u000aposter. As the years go by Rita becomes Marilyn, Marilyn becomes\u000aRaquel. It's as good a way as any to mark the passage of time. Time\u000amarches on. The world moves on. But the men of Shawshank are left\u000abehind. That would be hard enough to take even if you were stone-cold\u000aguilty, a menace to society. For an innocent man like Andy Dufresne?\u000aYou wonder how he cannot be utterly defeated by life. Yet somehow he\u000amaintains a sense of calm and a great inner strength. There's something\u000aabout this guy.What exactly is it about Andy Dufresne? Hard to say because the story\u000ais never really told through his eyes but rather through those of his\u000afriend Red. We come to know Andy only to the extent that Red does. And\u000afor this story that setup really works. Tim Robbins is excellent in the\u000arole of Andy, the film's hero figure, but Morgan Freeman has perhaps\u000athe more challenging job in playing Red. Freeman's character serves as\u000athe audience's eyes and ears. And he also serves as the movie's voice.\u000aExtensive use of voice-over narration in films can be an iffy\u000aproposition, often proving more distracting than helpful. But Freeman's\u000avoice, Red's voice really, narrates this story beautifully. Playing off\u000aone another wonderfully Robbins and Freeman make a terrific team. This\u000ais a movie content to let its two main characters just sit around and\u000atalk. True, there's not much else to do inside those prison walls. But\u000asome of the shared moments between Andy and Red are as poignant as any\u000ayou'll see in any film and the two actors deserve their due credit for\u000amaking it so.You wouldn't go so far as to call it slow but the movie certainly\u000aproceeds at a deliberate pace. This is a story which takes its time in\u000aletting you know where it is ultimately headed. It's essentially Andy's\u000astory, as told by Red. But there is room for some other characters to\u000acarve out their place as well. Most touching is the story of elderly\u000aprisoner Brooks, as played beautifully by James Whitmore. His little\u000astory within the story definitely tugs on the heartstrings. Of course\u000afor any movie to truly succeed there has to be some conflict and for\u000athat we have guard Byron Hadley and warden Samuel Norton. At least\u000aHadley is upfront in his evilness. Norton's one of film history's\u000abiggest hypocrites, walking around the prison spouting Bible verses all\u000athe while being engaged in all manner of unseemly activities. This is a\u000aman who needs a comeuppance. But in the world of Shawshank it is Norton\u000awho has all the power. This is a story seemingly destined for a very\u000aunhappy ending. The righteous man does not seem at all likely to\u000aprevail. But, slowly but surely, the movie continues to build towards\u000asomething. What that something will be you can't quite be sure. But\u000awhen the moment comes where all is revealed the film's ultimate triumph\u000ais secured. For you have seen not only an entertaining and utterly\u000acompelling story. You've seen something which can't help but make you\u000afeel better about life in general. This is a movie to see when you need\u000ato have a little of your faith in humanity restored. It may not be, as\u000ait is in some places proclaimed to be, the best movie ever made. But is\u000aan undeniably excellent movie which has rightfully become rather\u000abeloved by most everyone who sees it.\u000a

V\u000aFor a long time now I had seen this movie move up the IMDb ladder and\u000amake its way to becoming #1, I was a bit irritated being that it took\u000athe spot of "The Godfather" however, this was before I had ever laid my\u000aeyes on even a trailer for this film, so I researched through the\u000acredits and found out that it was based on a novel by one of my\u000afavorite writers "Stephen King", I know what your thinking, how could\u000ahe be one of my favorite writers if I didn't even have a clue about\u000athis Masterpiece. July 24, 2010 was my movie day, I promised myself I\u000awas going to stay up 24 Hours watching some of my favorite Films, I\u000astarted of at around 12:45 with the controversial, sadistic, genius,\u000amasterpiece that is "A Clockwork Orange", then after my brain was\u000athrough with Ultra-Violence I proceeded watching the best sequel ever\u000amade in the History of cinema "The Godfather Part II", then after I\u000afelt like a Corleone I started watching the Coen Brothers Masterpiece\u000a"No Country For Old Men", then after feeling lost I started watching\u000a"Pulp Fiction" and after that the time was around 4:30 P.M. and I broke\u000amy promise to myself and took what I thought was going to be a 2 Hour\u000aNap which turned into a 6 Hour Intermission, I woke up around 10:00\u000adeciding which movie I was going to watch and I wanted it to be a\u000aClassic I had never seen, I was thinking "12 Angry Men" but for some\u000areason I wanted to see what the all this fuss was about when it came to\u000aShawkshank Redemption" so I rented it and started watching around 11:45\u000aP.M., Let me just say after this movie left an Impact in my Life and\u000aMind, I now actually know why it is #1 on this site and it is for good\u000areason, this movie made me laugh hysterically at times like in "Animal\u000aHouse", it made me think like "Fight Club" does at times, it made me\u000afrightened like "The Shining" at times and I have no other movie to\u000areference my Sobbing emotions with because no other film has made me\u000aCry, and that should tell you that after a day of Great Films this one\u000ahad the biggest Impact on me.\u000a

V\u000aI have seen this movie about 6 times and I get stunned every time. Now\u000ahas past one year since I last saw her, so it got me thinking; what is\u000aso good about this film? is'it the story? the director? the actors? or\u000amaybe just all of this things?. I mean what makes this the best movie\u000aever made?? Is'it the feel-good feeling in the end? I don't know a\u000aperson whose does't feel good after this movie. Tim's and Morgans's\u000aperformances both deserved Oscar, but I'm not gonna take'it from Tom\u000aHank's that his performance in Forres Gump also deserved Oscar. So if\u000aanyone can tell me the ONE thing that make's this the best movie ever\u000amade.\u000a

V\u000aThe Shawshank Redemption.The best movie i have seen yet.Its adapted\u000afrom a novel by Stephen King but this is a special film even better\u000athan the novel i suppose.Best adaptation yet to walk through in\u000aInternational Cinema.The great camaraderie between Tim Robbins & Morgan Freeman is very\u000adifficult to surpass.Wow!!What an on screen display by both of them. If\u000aRobbins was fantastic then Morgan was emphatic.Brilliant acting by Tim\u000aRobbins.The best by him so far.Even he would admit.Morgan Freeman comes\u000aout with an en-lighted performance.His dialogs in the film are truly\u000ainspiring & heart aching.Fantastic work by him.An epitome of\u000aperformance by Morgan Freeman.The rest of the casting is good.James\u000aWhitmore as Brooks is a revelation,so is Bob Gunton as the warden.The plot is superb.Ending is classy.You can never make out what\u000ahappened in the end.Its such a travesty that you have to watch it\u000aagain.The directorial of Frank Darabont is top stuff whereas the\u000ascreenplay by him is very much adulated.The dialogs are so memorable\u000ayou will always carry them along.Here are some of the best dialogs from\u000athis:Andy Dufresne: They say it has no memory. That's where I want to live\u000athe rest of my life. A warm place with no memory.Red: Let me tell you something my friend. Hope is a dangerous thing.\u000aHope can drive a man insane. Andy Dufresne: That's the beauty of music. They can't get that from\u000ayou... Haven't you ever felt that way about music? Red: We sat and drank with the sun on our shoulders and felt like free\u000amen.This movie is the epitome of all others.No movie can emulate the\u000acamaraderie between that of those two Shawshank Prisoners.Must watch\u000afor a fabulous & thrilling experience.\u000a

V\u000aActed out perfectly by every cast member, under the watchful eye of\u000aFrank Darabont, the story of a man who brings hope to the grey walls of\u000aShawshank prison becomes so much more than a prison movie. The first\u000atime I ever saw "The Shawshank Redemption", I knew nothing about it,\u000aand was utterly unprepared for it's effect. Within the first ten\u000aminutes, I was utterly drawn in, unable to pull my eyes away from the\u000ascreen. By the end of the first hour, I couldn't even think about\u000apausing or stopping this film. I spent the last fifteen minutes crying\u000amy eyes out at the sheer emotion in those minutes. Morgan Freeman\u000aout-does his every role previous and every role since as Red, while Tim\u000aRobbins, quiet and intense, leads the cast as Andy. This film been\u000aregarded for more than fifteen years as one of the greatest to ever\u000aemerge from cinema. It is a story of corruption, and of justice. A\u000astory of imprisonment and of freedom. A story of despair and of hope.\u000aMore even, than all of that, "Shawshank" is a story of humanity, and\u000aone that will stay with whomever watches it for a very, very, long\u000atime.\u000a

V\u000a"The Shawshank Redemption" did not win "Best Picture" because it will\u000aremain to be an example of how a movie does NOT need to win some sort\u000aof "award" top be considered one of the most prolific experiences an\u000aacting production can make someone go through. This is not just a movie...It's an experience that everyone need to\u000apartake in. I have maybe only seen about 450-500 major motion pictures\u000awith about 80% of them being produced after 1980, BUT THIS IS THE ONLY\u000aMOVIE OUT OF ALL WHERE I ACTUALLY FORGET THESE ARE ACTORS ACTING IN\u000aFRONT OF A CAMERA WITH A MOVIE CREW. Do you know what that means? --It\u000ameans not only Frank Darabont, but every single person involved in this\u000afilm fused so well that they truly made a piece of artwork that puts\u000apeople in such an emotional trance they forget whats happening for 2\u000ahours. THIS IS WHAT EVERY DIRECTOR AND PERSON WHO WORKS IN THE FILM\u000aBUSINESS DREAMS ABOUT...MAKING A MOVIE THIS GROUNDBREAKING."The Shawshank Redemption" will show you how true friendship can arise\u000afrom anywhere...Even in a prison--where people fear the most to be in.\u000a--Maybe it shows the intrinsic drive humans have to create a social\u000abond in any situation.Sometimes when I talk about this movie to people I feel really\u000adisturbed when someone has not seen it. I feel like saying "are you\u000ainsane?"\u000a

V\u000aI used to like action movies more than anything else. I watched\u000aShawshank Redemption in 2007. When I watched it for the first time I\u000adid not know that it is a great movie. When I watched it for the second\u000atime I felt that it should be one of the greatest movies. For the first\u000atime checked IMDb's top 250 movies and I amazed to see Shawshank\u000aRedemption at number two, anyway, it's number one at present.The performances of all the artists are excellent. Not a single\u000acharacter is waste. Especially Tim Robins excels as Andy Dufresne.\u000aNarration by Morgan Freeman is sensational. The scenes between Morgan\u000aFreeman and Tim Robins are by far the best. The ending is one of best\u000asurprises I have seen in movies.This movie should have got the Ascar.I give 10 out of 10 for this phenomenal movie.\u000a

V\u000aSeeing Shawshank as the IMDb #1 did not surprise me a bit. This movie\u000ahas the heart & soul to be a favourite for a long time to come.I like the reality of the unfairness of the whole situation. There is\u000ano glossing over the painful stuff. He was innocent but still jailed.\u000aHe did get raped. His chance DID get wiped out to have his story\u000aconfirmed. What a waste.I read some people calling this a 'feel-good' story. Perhaps in the\u000aend, but other than the relief of freedom, there wasn't much to feel\u000agood about. Talk about a hard-fought battle. And it isn't even over...\u000aHis life is better than it was, but still sucks considering everything\u000ahe lost, considering he can never go back, considering he is always a\u000afugitive...If you're feeling bummed out about your own life, this is a good movie\u000ato watch to realize that things could always be worse.\u000a

V\u000aIn these times, where an "Every man for himself" mentality prevails and\u000aone's self worth is measured by possessions, this movie reminds us that\u000athe escalating fear that we all have, as this country spirals out of\u000acontrol, is best abated by having someone you can call a true friend.As time passes and, more of us see that this country is heading\u000ainexorably toward social, political and economic disaster, this movie\u000awill find an even larger audience of devotees. Perhaps, one day, we\u000awill abandon our materialism and discover that true hope which we will\u000adesperately need and, a major theme of this movie, lies in our\u000arelationships with others. Until then, we will have the Shawshank\u000aRedemption to remind us what real friendship looks like.\u000a

A thundering\u000areassurance in the hope for a better tomorrow, this movie is truly an\u000aepitome of hope and perseverance. Probably should be filed under the\u000acategory of movies you should watch anyhow before you die. True\u000amasterpiece. There won't be another movie that can be quite anything\u000alike this.This movie is so powerful that I can't even describe this in a few\u000awords. This is the kind of movie that rekindles hopes in all of us. The\u000akind of movie that will always keep moving and impressing generations\u000ato come. With a storyline that not only will blow you away, but also\u000astrengthen your hopes and faith in the fact that "Hope is a good thing.\u000aMaybe the best of things. And no good thing ever dies".\u000a

V\u000aI've read a lot of the comments here. I've never voted for this movie\u000aonce, but now I'm going to give it what it deserves. And I am going to\u000atry to describe why a lot of Shawshank fans are voting this the best\u000amovie ever.The reasons that this movie is great are: it has incredible acting,\u000aincredible story-telling, incredible pace, incredible writing and\u000adialogue, incredible imagery, and an incredible twist and ending.The Godfather also has these qualities.But the reason Shawshank is better is because it literally is\u000apotentially life-changing. People watch Shawshank and someone truly may\u000abelieve in HOPE. They may truly believe their lives will get better.\u000aThey may truly believe others' lives can be made better. Its message is\u000anot only told, but it is FELT and oft times ABSORBED. For men, for\u000awomen, for old, for young, for everyone. It is a masterpiece. What\u000aother movie affects people in this way? You don't get that with The\u000aGodfather. GF is a great film, but you just come out of it saying,\u000a"Wow, that was one of the best films I've ever seen." With Shawshank,\u000ayou say more than that. You feel more than that.You will never see another like it. And the mere perfection of this\u000amovie, by a novice director, will frustrate experienced and future\u000adirectors forever.\u000a

V\u000aI'm a big fan of movies that have depth and tells a great story.\u000aAmerican movies doesn't always provide that.The Shawshank Redemption, however, is a prime example of what American\u000astory telling can be. With a slight non-linear build up, strong and patient character\u000adevelopment, the movie drags you more and more into the despair of Andy\u000aDufresne, but always with a sense of hope.For me, there's no two ways about it. This is simply the best movie\u000aever made.10/10.\u000a

V\u000aI totally adored the concept of hope in this film. I love how the\u000adirector portrays the Shawshank tyrants as corrupt murderers, that's\u000apretty much what they are and serve as the grounds for the escape of\u000aAndy. Now Morgan Freeman's got talent, I love that guy he may not be\u000athe greatest out there but he is a force to be reckoned with on the\u000aset. I loved how he gave the story flavor with his descriptions of\u000acharacters and perceptions of how life was in lonely jail cells of\u000aShawshank. You know there's a lot more to say about this movie, it's\u000atoo good too be true. Especially the ending which by the way brought\u000atears to eyes, the most moving scene!!! Overall it was superb and all\u000athanks to Stephen King for putting this in the form of alphabets in the\u000afirst place. I'm starting to regret not reading any of his novels. And\u000akudos to the director for even coming up with such an idea for a movie.\u000a

V\u000aOne of my favorite movies ever,The Shawshank Redemption is a modern day\u000aclassic as it tells the story of two inmates who become friends and\u000afind solace over the years in which this movie takes place.Based on a\u000aStephen King novel,this movie makes us feel different watching this\u000afilm than most others as this is an incredibly realistic film.Tim\u000aRobbins stars as Andy Dufresne who is convicted of murder and Morgan\u000aFreeman as Ellis Boyd "Red" Redding who is a fellow inmate and close\u000afriend of Dufresne and Bob Gunton as Warden Samuel Norton who is the\u000aWarden of Shawshank State Prison and is a character who has mixed\u000afeelings and emotions towards everyone around him and a character who\u000ais sometimes easy to like and at other times easy to despise.This film\u000ais easily considered one of the greatest films of all time and I\u000adefinitely agree with this fact.It was nominated for seven Academy\u000aAwards including (Best Picture, Best Actor  Morgan Freeman, Best\u000aAdapted Screenplay, Best Cinematography, Best Editing, Best Original\u000aScore, and Best Sound) but didn't win any due to tough competition from\u000athe film Forrest Gump.I personally think that Tim Robbins should have\u000abeen nominated for the Best Actor award as he really gave the\u000aperformance of his career.Bravo to this brilliant modern day classic!\u000a

V\u000aAt the time of writing this comment, IMDb ranks the Shawshank\u000aRedemption as No. 2 in top 250 best movies of all time. Let me tell you\u000athat this is no exaggeration and no small feat given IMDb's strict\u000arating criteria. Shawshank is indeed, up there amongst the best, and if\u000ayou haven't seen it yet, you should make it a point to watch it, at\u000aleast once sometime in your life. For it is an astonishing tale, of\u000aendurance, courage, life, and perspective, combined with a stunning\u000ascore that flows so closely with the highs and lows of emotion that it\u000acould make grown men cry. No words can explain how good Shawshank\u000areally is, but let the sheer volume of good user reviews made by\u000adevotees in this website be proof enough of its greatness.\u000a

V\u000aTo be honest, I enjoy reading a good novel more than watching a film.\u000aYou usually get far more character development than in a movie (e.g.\u000aPuzo's The Godfather).But not with Shawshank. This is the closest thing film has to a perfect\u000astory. The characters, pacing, plot, monologues and every other element\u000acontribute to an inspirational yarn with a fulfilling ending. Brook's suicide is the only film scene that has ever moved me to tears,\u000aand if you watch just one film in your life - let it be this. Not a\u000afilm which others have tried to mimic for a good box office, e.g. LOTR:\u000aThe Return of the King, The Godfather, but an original, stand-alone\u000afilm that, in my opinion, will never be surpassed in quality\u000a

V\u000aThis is one of the best movies ever made. Not really because it's\u000areally really good but because everyone likes it! I can't think of\u000aanyone who doesn't like this movies, young, old, male, female and over\u000athe entire globe! Good Work! It's a story about a man (Tim Burton) who\u000ais cent to jail for a crime he didn't commit (the murder of his wife\u000aand lover). In jail he meets good and bad people like always. One of\u000athem is Morgan Freeman. He is the guy who can get you anything you\u000awant. Because Tim Burton is innocent and a very intelligent guy he is\u000adesperately trying to find a way out of this jail. The relationship\u000abetween Tim Burton and the rest of his jail-mates can be touching but\u000aalso horrible and with some violence. This is a great "feelgood" movie\u000aabout hope, love, hate and freedom!\u000a

The direction of it is exquisite\u000a(and gives much to Tim Robbins character, I know he is a good actor, but\u000athe\u000adirection gives so much more to him).  The soundrack is unparalleled and\u000athe\u000astory is exquisite (thanks to Stephen King).  I have seen many greats,\u000aCitizen Kane, The Godfather, Cuckoo's Nest, The Deer Hunter, Apocalypse\u000aNow....etc. This movie is fantastic, and the fact it didnt' win (or even\u000aget\u000anominated) for an Oscar is the reason I don't pay attention to the Oscars\u000aanymore. This movie is fantastic, and an artistic triumph. I have no\u000arespect\u000afor the Academy for ignoring this flick.\u000a

V\u000a\u000aPeople look for all sorts of things in movies, and you can see it in the\u000aoccasional negative review that pops up for this movie.  Some viewers are\u000alooking for gritty realism in everything on the screen.  Others are action\u000ajunkies.  Still others perhaps take film too seriously and reduce\u000amoviemaking to nothing more than a game of who can come up with the edgiest\u000ashot, or the niftiest angle.  For all of these, there is the very real\u000achance that they simply will not "get" this film, and that's too bad -- they\u000aare missing out on a classic.At its best, film can transcend merely being a series of pictures, no matter\u000ahow pretty, and can reach down and touch people.  That is where Shawshank\u000asucceeds so brilliantly.  It is not the fastest moving movie, not the\u000aedgiest, not the grittiest, it is filmed in shades of gray.  But this movie\u000aabsolutely sings with human spirit, and captures an universal human theme as\u000awell as any movie has ever done.  And THAT is filmmaking at its finest.  Not\u000aa game, not eye candy -- this movie stays with you long after the credits\u000ahave rolled.\u000a

V\u000a\u000aIt deserves ten stars. Its beauty lies in its slow pace and genteel wit,\u000aalthough some may not have the patience for the slowness. But the whole\u000apremise of life inside a prison cell makes better sense when told in a calm,\u000aemotion-building, pace such as this. Otherwise, one would never get to know\u000aTim Robbins's quiet accountant (and what makes him appear alternately shy,\u000asnobbish, and suicidal all at the same time); or Morgan Freeman's\u000agenial-but-cynical lifer- not to mention how he's "a man who knows how to\u000aget things." I love what the film doesn't do: it doesn't make an issue of\u000aits two leads being different races (although one could claim that makes\u000atheir friendship all the more marvelous), it doesn't pull any sensational,\u000afar-out, action punches (as films with an all-male cast often do), and it\u000adoesn't freeze its characters into types. Everyone is real and everyone is\u000aflawed- from James Whitmore's bird loving veteran to Bob Gunton's\u000apretentious, icy, warden. But the finish (which really starts around the\u000afilm's last twenty minutes) is one of the most powerful and moving things\u000aever committed to film. Get it in either format. \u000a

V\u000a\u000aSorry folks, but can this film really be (one of) the greatest of all time?\u000aEntertaining? Yes. Well acted? Err...yes.  'Life affirming'? No way.\u000aRealistic?

Not an extra wrinkle to be seen.\u000aWhat happened to the make-up department?People get beaten to within an inch of their lives. One death and one\u000awheelchair case, but otherwise just a couple of bruises which disappear\u000arapidly.The 'baddies' get their just deserts and we're all supposed to shout 'serve\u000athem right' (as we say in England).\u000aThe 'goodies' live happily ever after, but we knew that would happen within\u000athe first ten minutes.\u000aThe people who think this is a great film probably think Stephen King is a\u000agreat author. Competent and popular...yes. Great...no!!\u000aP.S. Who replaced the poster after...?\u000aWas that an oak tree? Maybe leaves are a different shape in\u000aAmerica.\u000a

V\u000a\u000aThe reason I am commenting on this film is that I saw that it is #2 in the\u000aIMDB top 250 films of all time. Why? It is a good movie, for sure, but there\u000aare so many movies that are far superior. Does it really deserve to be ABOVE\u000a"Citizen Kane"?The Shawshank Redemption is a great story, with fantastic performances by\u000aTim Robbins and Morgan Freeman, but it is also a conventional Hollywood\u000amovie and just doesn't venture into very deep waters.Stephen King creates great stories that hold the reader's interest throughout\u000aand are always exciting, whatever the genre. Yet he doesn't really make any\u000avery interesting insights into humanity. His characters are either good or\u000aevil; there is no in-between for him. That is not to say that his "good"\u000acharacters cannot commit crimes or make mistakes, but the "evil" characters\u000aseem to have no motivation beyond just being, well, basically evil! For\u000aexample, Clancy Brown's prison guard and \u000aBob Gunton's warden are rather one-dimensional characters. Why do they\u000aexist? To make the protagonist's life a living hell. For no other\u000areason.****SPOILERS BEGIN**** While Tim Robbin's prison escape makes you go\u000a"woohoo" and jump up and down in your chair, it's just not a very feasible\u000aplot development. I mean, come on, the guy is there for 20 years and NOBODY\u000anotices that he has dug a four foot hole through his wall? I don't usually\u000ahave a problem with surrealism in films, but this is not a surreal film. It\u000ais otherwise realistic, so the escape scene just didn't sit right with me.\u000a****SPOILERS END****Every scene is accompanied with trite music, so that we know when to be\u000ahappy, when to be concerned, when to get teary-eyed. The cinematography is\u000atechnically fine, but there's nothing new in that department. The villains\u000aare completely one dimensional characters with nearly no motivation except\u000afor their own sadism, and the film leaves no room for you to draw your own\u000aconclusions. Like in most Hollywood films, it is expected that the audience\u000ais basically stupid so we have to have it spelled out for us in the end. The\u000amovie goes on about ten minutes too long. I gave this movie an eight out of\u000aten, because I love a good story and Tim Robbins is excellent as always, but\u000ait is not really the most original film of all time.There are several prison films which I would rate superior to this one.\u000aAmong them, "Kiss of the Spider Woman", "Papillon", and "Cool Hand Luke".\u000aSee these first before you give this movie a ten out of\u000aten.\u000a

V\u000aA great film and one that I shall be adding to my collection at some\u000apoint, but #2?One user put it very well when they said that the film's essential\u000amessage of 'the human spirit conquering all' is very uplifting an'\u000aeverything but sounds too much like a fortune cookie homily.There are several films that deliver the same message just as well if\u000anot better. Jim Sheridan's "In the Name of the Father" springs\u000aimmediately to mind. That film has a similar theme to this one\u000a(wrongful imprisonment and the struggle to come to terms with it) but\u000ais a much better film IMO. What's even more heartening is that it's\u000aalso true.Like I said, I'm not dissing the film. it IS great. From what I can\u000aremember all the performances are nicely judged (Freeman is excellent,\u000abut then what's new?), the direction is perfect because it's so\u000aunobtrusive to the story, and the film in general is uplifting. I just\u000athink it's nothing particularly new and it has been done better. Maybe\u000amy viewpoint is borne out by the fact that it only became a huge\u000asuccess on video release?I gave it an 8. To me, this fact proves that I love the film, just not\u000aas much as everybody else seems to!I think this adaptation is on a par with the short story, which was\u000aalso excellent. I honestly can't agree with #2 on the top 250 list\u000athough. Is it just an American over-reaction to the movie or is every\u000aother nation as awestruck by it? Please feel free to e-mail me for\u000adiscussion on this, or anything else for that matter.#2 of 250? I don't think it would make it into my top 50 films.Ah well, life's all about opinions...\u000a

V\u000a\u000aFilms that invoke volumous comments are either visually sensional,\u000aobjects of\u000amedia hype or emotionally stimulating. Shawshank Redemption falls into the\u000alatter category.\u000aI saw it for the first time on television, it did not need the wide screen\u000aor dramatic visual effects because it had been well-adapted from Stephen\u000aKing's book to portray something that has  worried everyone at some time in\u000atheir lives.  Being convicted of a crime that they did not commit and locked\u000aup for life with the very worst types of human beings.  How being\u000ainstitutionalised is the only way to survive, but when it ends there is no\u000away to go, no way to return to a former life.\u000aAll human existence is based on a survival instinct. Once that is destroyed,\u000adeath is a welcome relief.The story hinges around three men,  one who never lost it and escaped to\u000alive again, one who nearly lost it but re-gained hope from the first and one\u000awho lost it and killed himself.\u000aAlthough the setting was the harsh and hostile environment of prison, it\u000acould have been any other institution, a hospital, an old peoples home even \u000aa family home.Andy Dufresne is different because he never lost the hope of escape, he used the\u000aweaknesses of others, the corruption of prison officials, the internal\u000aprison system to help his long term plan.  He had the great advantage over\u000athe others, including the Prison staff of being , intellignet knowledgable\u000aand clever. Such people always win through.  I did not know what the end was\u000agoing to be, a clever piece of filming.  Although the meassage was not lost,It should give encouragement to all those who find themselves in a similar\u000aposition. The justice system, although far from perfect is much improved so\u000amiscarriages can now be corrected. But I still wounder what it must feel\u000alike to be in the situation of Andy Dufresne but without his\u000aabilities.Let's have more such films that provoke the senses and emotions as this one\u000adid.  I make no excuse in adding to the hundreds of comments already make on\u000athis film , although I have not read them because I wanted mine to be\u000aoriginal. But no doubt other thinking people would have made similar\u000acomments.  I hope that writers, producers and sponsors read these comments\u000aand take note when making more such films\u000a\u000a

V\u000a\u000aI am not a big fan of Stephen King books. Therefore, it came as a complete\u000asurprise that this compelling story was written by the "King of Horror"\u000ahimself.\u000aNever has any other movie entertained in so many different ways. It\u000amanages\u000ato be disturbing and uplifting, both funny and moving. Morgan Freeman is\u000atop\u000anotch as usual, and Tim Robbins gives his best performance as lead\u000acharacter\u000aAndy Dufresne.\u000aIf you haven't seen this movie yet, do yourself a favour and buy it from\u000ayour local video store.

V\u000a\u000aStephen King is my favorite writer and I've read all of his books.  When I\u000afirst learned of them making a movie of "Rita Hayworth and the Shawshank\u000aRedemption" I was excited. I'd always liked the story, and thought it would\u000amake a great movie.  But I was also apprehensive, because most movies don't\u000ado the book they're based on justice, especially when it comes to Steve's\u000abooks.  But I'm glad to say that I worried about nothing.  Very glad.  The\u000aShawshank Redemption is one of the very best movies from a Stephen King book\u000aever made, and one of my favorite movies of all time.  My\u000ascore-10.\u000a

V\u000a\u000aThe key scene in The Shawshank Redemption comes when Red is confronted by\u000aAndy Dufresne with the fact that he has given up hope.  "Hope is a dangerous\u000athing," says Red, and we understand, after the trials he has been through,\u000awhy he can say this and believe it.  And because this is such a well-crafted\u000afilm, we can also see why Andy refuses to accept this philosophy, because by\u000athis time we have come to know them both so well.\u000aThe movie follows the lives of these two men, who have come to Shawshank\u000aPrison at different times in their lives, as very different people. Red has\u000abeen there long enough, denied parole enough times that he no longer waits\u000afor the day he will be released, but for the days he makes his pickup at the\u000alaundromat for the goods he sells to the inmates.  Andy was a wealthy banker\u000aon the outside, who is sentenced to prison for killing his wife and lover in\u000aa nightmarish trial, the kind where every shred of evidence points to\u000aculpability.  The movie casts doubt on his guilt long before it reveals what\u000aactually happened.  In prison he faces beatings, rape and oppression, but\u000athere is some kind of redemption here, too; as the film's title suggests,\u000athis is not a joyless foray into prison life but a story about the way two\u000adifferent men cope with the day to day routine of incarceration, and what\u000afollows beyond it.\u000aWhat amazed me, watching the movie, is the the filmmakers have pulled of\u000athe tricky job of taking this material that could have been cloying and made\u000ait plausible, even meaningful.  It is worth seeing just as a statement about\u000ahow the choices we make in life are more important than what happens to\u000aus.\u000a

Well, that and Morgan\u000aFreeman's calming voice. Not that challenging cinematically and a bit of a fantasy that pawns\u000aitself off as gritty realism, to be honest. Not to be an alarmist, but part of me wonders whether this film would\u000abe Exhibit A should the country ever descend into a fascist\u000adictatorship much like "From Caligari to Hitler" by Siegfried Kracauer\u000aexamined German film during the rise of the Nazi's after World War I.\u000aThere is something going on on a group psychology level here that bears\u000aexamination.\u000a

V\u000aone of the films that you must watch in lifetime. A film about\u000along-term imprisonment that takes its time to convey what the slow\u000acrawl of a lifer's existence might feel like. Thoroughly gripping, and\u000apretty refreshing. Ten years ago The Shawshank Redemption was a low-key\u000aprison film that didn't recoup its costs. Slowly it has become one of\u000athe most popular movies of all time - and, for some, it has even been\u000alife- changing. It is a strange comment to make about a film set inside\u000aa prison, but "The Shawshank Redemption" creates a warm hold on our\u000afeelings because it makes us a member of a family. Many movies offer us\u000avicarious experiences and quick, superficial emotions. "Shawshank"\u000aslows down and looks. It uses the narrator's calm, observant voice to\u000ainclude us in the story of men who have formed a community behind bars.\u000aIt is deeper than most films; about continuity in a lifetime, based on\u000afriendship and hope.\u000a

V\u000aWhere do I start? When I first heard of The Shawshank Redemption I\u000aimmediately wanted to watch it, mostly of its title, so as I always do\u000aI looked it up on IMDb and looked at the rating. It was the highest\u000aranked movie on IMDb, and of course I would give it a go. The beginning\u000awas very interesting, with Andy being convicted of double homicide and\u000aseeing the lean-back of what happened. Him being found guilty, serving\u000atwo life sentences in the toughest prison in America, Shawshank. I\u000athought it would be another overrated boring movie like The Godfather,\u000abut no, it caught my attention from the start and never lost it either.\u000aThe dramatic scenes, it gives you a glance of how it is in prison, the\u000aemotional scenes. It is all a masterpiece, there is a reason to why it\u000ais the best movie I have ever watched and probably will ever watch. The\u000aamazing acting, plot and moderate length. The last scene, with "Red"\u000awalking up the beach towards Andy and the credits slowly rolling in, it\u000amakes you beg for it to never end. When it comes to movies I can\u000asometimes get a little emotional if its a good movie, which Shawshank\u000ais. It definitely deserves the spot as #1, I cannot understand how it\u000adidn't win an Oscar.I really recommend this movie to anyone who wants a good weekend, but\u000aget a load of potato chips and soda, since you will finish it all up\u000avery fast.\u000a

Tim Robbins\u000aperformance is great as he lived the role and the eye stretcher movie\u000ashawshank redemption.\u000a

V\u000aI cant believe that something so simply good exists. This is by far the\u000abest thing i have ever watched on my TV. I loved every piece of it and\u000ai'm gonna watch it once a year till my time on this world is over. I\u000acan't describe the feeling and joy you will have after watching it,\u000abecause i can't find the right words to describe it. Watch it and you\u000awill see what i mean. The first time is always the best. It's the time\u000awhen it will leave you speechless for a couple of seconds. And after\u000athose seconds you will begin to understand that you just watched a\u000amasterpiece. What i liked the most is the big time span in which the\u000amovie plays. All those years in one place and the dependence for some\u000apeople after you leave it.\u000a

V\u000aWhen I watched Shawshank Redemption at first,I had been in the high\u000aschool and this film left a good impression with me, I say that I\u000alearned how to follow your passions and hopes, how to struggle to be\u000afree. And " don't never forget,hope is good something and good\u000asomethings never die " this sentence which passes in the film, I always\u000abelieve it every part of mine. Because A person lives with his or her\u000ahopes and passions so, If it is seized from people,that people lose\u000atheir aims in the life. And what the best properties of this film, It\u000ashows that hopes and passions are indispensable for people...In\u000aaddition to my review about Shawshank Redemption, Whenever I watch this\u000afilm, I learn that it puts in new things my life. It is so important\u000afor every watcher, Shawshank Redemption should be watched and I advise\u000ait to you :)\u000a

V\u000aFirst of all you need to be prepared for this 3 hour long movie(though\u000athe movie worths it).Morgan freeman's background voice will keep you\u000awith the story.Dialogues were well executed.The strongest part was it's\u000anarration which makes it the best.I wouldn't have watched this if it\u000awasn't on the top of IMDb list.At some point of time i felt the movie\u000ais just dragging on the story.Still at the end you won't mind it. The movie also carries the message of friendship,hope,will and\u000abrilliance of our protagonist.Sometimes i felt pity on him and\u000asometimes i couldn't stop myself praising his brilliance.I think this movie will keep impressing generations ahead,no matter how\u000amuch advance human becomes.\u000a

V\u000aI had heard a lot about this movie being a 'classic' and a 'must-see'\u000aand normally that negatively impacts my view of a movie because\u000aunrealistic expectation often ruins the true quality of a movie. This\u000amovie, however, managed to surpass all my expectations.I didn't know much concerning the story, except that it was a movie set\u000ain a prison but it's so much more than that. The major theme that\u000abecame apparent to me throughout this movie was how we regard as good\u000aand evil is largely dependent on the storyteller and how he chooses to\u000apaint the heroes/villains. Convicted felons are not usually considered\u000a'heroes' or people that you root for and want to succeed but the story\u000ais about so much more than that. The Shawshank Redemption is about hope\u000aand more importantly the struggle to maintain it, when the world is\u000adoing its best to crush it.Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman's on-screen chemistry is amazing. There\u000aare no weak scenes, no wasted dialogue. They are the best things about\u000athe movie, they make you believe, they make you hope.\u000a

V\u000aYes, Stephen King writes drama. He also wrote Stand By Me, The Green\u000aMile, and Dolores Claiborne. He has definitely been typed as a horror\u000awriter, when he is an amazing tearjerker. This film is amazing. Words\u000acannot describe just how amazing this film truly is. I thought that I\u000awould not like this film, as it looked like "a bad sports movie". But,\u000awhen my science teacher told me I should see it, "because it's a movie\u000awhere you just go, 'wow'". I did and I was literally in tears by the\u000aend. Not in tears of sadness, but tears of joy. Because the film was\u000asimply so beautiful. Not very many films have made me cry. Of course, I\u000acried at the endings of Marley and Me, and Toy Story 3. But there are\u000aonly 3 films I've ever cried at. Some people say Citizen Kane or The\u000aGodfather are the best movies ever. FALSE. They are overrated. This\u000afilm is a diamond in the rough. Most people are stubborn and won't even\u000atake this gem into consideration. It truly is the best movie ever. The\u000amusic, the direction, the cast. I won't give anything away, you need to\u000asee the film to appreciate its true beauty, but I will say that the\u000amusic in this film puts John Williams to shame, and the movie reminds\u000aus that even in the most bleak of situations, life can still be great.\u000aIt is a great movie because it reminds us that hope is something that\u000anothing can quench.\u000a

V\u000aI do not even feel as though I need to go into a great amount of detail\u000ato explain just how amazing this film is.You've probably seen the movie sitting on the top spot of 'IMDB's top\u000a250', or maybe you've heard a friend babble on about how great the\u000amovie is and know it must be half-decent. I can assure you this will\u000alive up to your expectations. The acting, the plot, the setting, the\u000acast, the directing, the messages and symbols, the acting again\u000a(deserves another mention) is just about as perfect as a movie can be\u000ain this setting. Please don't waste your time pondering over whether or\u000anot to see this movie or whether or not you should believe the hype\u000abecause, I can assure you, you can. Go buy this from your local movie\u000astore or buy it online - I really don't care - just make sure you watch\u000athis film before anything else. As an 18-year-old guy, I can say with\u000aconfidence this is the best movie I have ever seen - or ever will see.\u000aGo watch it! Now!\u000a

V\u000aPersonally I was, and I am ashamed to say this, quite late to join the\u000ahuge number of film fans that would hold The Shawshank Redemption\u000awithin their Top 5 films of all time - if not number 1. If you're\u000awondering mine is "The Princess Bride", childhood favourite but that's\u000abeside the point.I think the first time I watched it was in 2006 and I instantly fell in\u000alove with it. I now watch the film at least 5/6 times a year without\u000afail and I am hardly ever far from tears of joy by the end.If you use the old analogy of "If an alien came to earth show them\u000ahow..." to make a film, you would show them this as the blueprint.Just brilliant.\u000a

V\u000aI'd heard about this film a few years ago and I'd heard it was good. I\u000awas lied to. This film wasn't good, It was outstanding! I can't believe\u000aI never watched this sooner! From the opening scenes where the\u000amysterious Andy Dufresne is being dragged into hell to the credits as\u000aRed runs across the beach to him, this film was, in a word, Perfect! No\u000aholes to spot, almost everything was completely accurate, Probably some\u000aof the best script I've ever heard and a brilliant story. Normally, If\u000aa film goes over two hours, I start to get a little bored and I end up\u000awanting the film to end but this was completely the opposite! I never\u000awanted this to end and the hefty 140 minutes get you wanting more and\u000athe story drew me in so much, I felt as if I was there. Normally with\u000afilms adapted from Stephen King books, they don't do so well on the big\u000ascreen but this has proved that wrong! Overall, I like this film\u000abecause it's realistic, it goes into great depth and the story is so\u000agripping, you can't take your eyes off the screen and this film will\u000aalways be there at the top as one of my favourite films ever!\u000a

V\u000aThe Shawshank Redemption is currently number one on the IMDb Top 250\u000alist. I don't particularly agree with that, but it is a truly great\u000amovie nonetheless. It is moving and compelling, and it touches the\u000aheart and soul.The story is set in the 1940s, and it involves Andy Dufrense (Tim\u000aRobbins), a young man who is convicted of murdering his wife and her\u000alover and is sentenced to life in the Shawshank Prison. As one would\u000aexpect, he is very unhappy at first, but then he leans that there's\u000asomething deeper that nobody can take away from you: hope. As the story\u000aunfolds, over the years, Andy eventually becomes very influential\u000awithin the prison and gains the respect of other inmates, especially\u000a"Red" (Morgan Freeman), with whom he develops a special friendship.The story isn't original or creative, and it's relatively simple, and a\u000abit predictable, but it's compelling, moving, and memorable, and\u000athere's a bit more to it which I won't go into. The movie puts the\u000aviewer right into the footsteps, experiences, and emotions of the\u000acharacters. Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman put on great performances.\u000aThey really bring out their characters and offer true depth and\u000aemotion. One of the major moral messages of the movie is that a person\u000amay be imprisoned, even for life, but the spirit can never truly be\u000aimprisoned. The movie conveys this moral message very strongly, and it\u000atruly touches the heart and soul.I am very glad I watched this movie. It is a truly emotional\u000aexperience.\u000a

V\u000aThe best movie ever made, period. I won't go on a very long and\u000adetailed review on the story(which is magnificent and perfect)I just\u000awant to say that this movie is a pure piece of art. The acting was\u000aperfect! I'm really disappointed that the actors didn't have enough\u000arecognition for their performances! Actually, the overall movie was\u000aunderestimate, by the Oscars especially.This movie shows why cinema is\u000aan art, powerful and heart full art. See this movie, you'll now what\u000aI'm talking about. I really tried to notice some gripes or problems\u000abut, I can't. This movie is touching, sad, beautiful, powerful and\u000aperfect. By the way, f**k the Academy Awards for dumping this movie and\u000ado for Forrest Gump for the trophies,but it's just trophies... Still a\u000ashame that they decided that.11 out of ten, totally deserves it.\u000a

V\u000aThis film is about hope, friendship and redemption. It has solid\u000aperformances from Morgan Freeman, Tim Robbins and Bob Gunton (the\u000awarden). Freeman masterfully narrates and he is the life blood of this\u000afilm. You experience everything through him; friendship, despair, hope,\u000aredemption and happiness. The musical score is nothing short of\u000afantastic and really elevates some of the more moving scenes in the\u000afilm.Firstly, this film is about hope. Andy is wrongly accused of murder and\u000ais sent to Shawshank prison. He has no friends and is quickly picked on\u000aat arrival because of his quiet, unassuming nature. But as time passes,\u000athe other inmates begin to respect Andy because he doesn't allow prison\u000ato break him. Andy perseverance is so strong that it begins to rub off\u000aon the others. I think to really get this film, you need to step away\u000afrom the context of it just being a prison movie. You could say the\u000aprison is life. The warden and the guards are problems, trials and\u000atroubles in life that can test and possible break you.No matter how bad\u000athings yet, no matter what brutal things you have to endure, you've\u000agotta hold out hope, you gotta hang on, you have to believe you're\u000agonna get through it. This is about the very nature of the human\u000aspirit, told in a very simple, straight forward way.This film is also about the power of friendship. I think Hollywood\u000aseems to have a hard time portraying a meaningful, male friendship and\u000ajust resorts to endless buddy and stoner movies. Shawshank does a great\u000ajob of this. I felt this aspect of the film was told in 2 parallel\u000astories. The first was the old librarian, Brooks. When he was released,\u000ahe struggled to adapt to the new world. As Red says, he had become\u000ainstitutionalized so much so that without Shawshank he felt alone,\u000aafraid and had no purpose. In the end, it was just too much for him to\u000abear. Easily one of the more heartbreaking scenes in the film, gets me\u000aevery time. When Red is released, he faces the exact same challenges\u000athat Brooks did. And he too struggled and almost lost hope. The only\u000athing that kept him him going, was his friendship with Andy. As Freeman\u000anarrates:"There's a harsh truth to face. No way I'm gonna make it on the\u000aoutside. All I do anymore is think of ways to break my parole, so maybe\u000athey'd send me back. Terrible thing, to live in fear. Brooks Hatlen\u000aknew it. Knew it all too well. All I want is to be back where things\u000amake sense. Where I won't have to be afraid all the time. Only one\u000athing stops me. A promise I made to Andy."It was literally the only thing he felt worth living for and a key part\u000aof the film I think people forget. And before Andy left prison, you\u000acould see how it deeply affected Red. He had lost his friend and the\u000aheartbreak of it was written all over Freeman's face, fantastic acting\u000aif you ask me; it was subtle, quiet suffering.And finally the film is about Redemption. Some people feel the\u000aredemption is Andy's. But I believe that Andy was just the agent of\u000aRed's redemption. At the start of the film Red was pretty much\u000aredesigned to life in prison. He had accepted that these were just the\u000acards he was dealt and there was no real reason to feel otherwise; he\u000ahad given up hope. The first few times he went for his parole hearing,\u000aRed was just going through the motions, he was just saying what he\u000athought he had to get to be let out. It was completely insincere.You can see an the film progresses Andy changing Red. There's a great\u000ascene where Red mentions that he used to play the harmonica. Andy gets\u000ahim one as a present and later, in a small but important scene, Red\u000apicks up the Harmonica and he quietly plays a note. For me this is\u000awhere Red begins to believe again. But the key scene for me is the last\u000aparole hearing. Red has been so affected by Andy, that for the first\u000atime he has a genuine moment of repentance, where he honestly admits to\u000ahis crime:"There's not a day goes by I don't feel regret. Not because I'm in\u000ahere, or because you think I should. I look back on the way I was then:\u000aa young, stupid kid who committed that terrible crime. I want to talk\u000ato him. I want to try and talk some sense to him, tell him the way\u000athings are. But I can't. That kid's long gone and this old man is all\u000athat's left. I got to live with that. Rehabilitated? It's just a\u000abullshit word. So you go on and stamp your form, sonny, and stop\u000awasting my time. Because to tell you the truth, I don't give a bleep."It really is just an incredible, moving scene, one of my all time\u000afavorites. Red is completely broken and regretful, it's nothing short\u000aof movie magic. And the ending? Well, let's just say it leaves me with\u000aa smile on my face. In my opinion this is the greatest film ever made.\u000aAn incredibly powerful, uplifting story. If you haven't seen this, you\u000aneed to.http://andretms.blogspot.ca/\u000a

V\u000aTo be brief, as a man who has watched thousands of movies in my life,\u000aShawshank redemption is the best movie I have ever seen. The plot, the\u000away it develops, the acting, the portrayal of every human emotion, and\u000athe ending makes 99% of movies seem like just a waste of time. I didn't\u000asee it until a few years after it came out. My sister said it was a\u000agreat movie. It was on HBO, so I watched it. I was speechless. I have\u000aalways found it strange that it was from a Steven King novel. I've read\u000aa few (not that one) and what comes through in the movie doesn't seem\u000alike anything that would be in a Steven King novel. A better movie may\u000acome along but it may be a while.\u000a

V\u000aThis review contains spoilers so better see the film and then read my\u000areview.Sometimes it makes me wonder why this film didn't go well in the box\u000aoffice. Shawshank redemption is not just about a story where a man\u000aescapes from a jail. It captures the life of people who spend their\u000alife in jail. I believe that jail life and free life are almost\u000asimilar. Sometimes we enjoy and sometimes we feel sad whether you live\u000ain jail or not. Sometimes life doesn't make any sense at all. Some\u000apeople succeed in their lives with ease and some people faces a great\u000adeal of hardship and still won't succeed in their life. These people\u000aare forced to the point of desperation. What they should know is that\u000aall of us have a destiny to reach and the main thing which matters the\u000amost is "hope" which you should need until the moment you die. If you\u000abelieve in yourself and have hope then one day you will reach your\u000adestiny in this life or in your after life.This film has really changed\u000amy way of looking the life.\u000a

V\u000aWell as the other more than 2000 review say it, in my opinion this is\u000athe best movie created so far. It basically just how life is: you get\u000apunched in a face time to time, but you have to stand up, keep your\u000ahope and give value to your fellows, because in return life takes care\u000aabout your reward. Oh yes, and if you face any evil that you can stop,\u000ado it. This is the message of the film, if we follow it, life may be as\u000arewarding ultimately for us as for the hero. Other films that moved me\u000alike this: Forrest Gump, The curious case of Benjamin Button. IMDb says\u000aI have to write another line in order for them to post my review so\u000ahere it is xD\u000a

The great Morgan Freeman not only puts in the\u000agreatest acting performance of his life, but quite possibly the\u000agreatest performance of all time.The script is so excellent that every word spoken sticks in your mind\u000aand later on in the movie you remember every word before it is\u000arecollected.This film makes you angry, upset, romantic, sick and elated. It touches\u000aall of the senses and you cannot take your eyes off the screen for one\u000aminute.The cinematography is excellent and so is the research and hard work\u000athat has gone into ensuring that all of the costumes and props are of\u000athe era.\u000a

The\u000amovie is About Andy Dufrane,a banker who has been wrongfully acquitted\u000aof killing his wife in cold blood and send to shaw shank prison.the\u000amovie shows the various hardships faced by Andy and how he does not\u000agive up hope and carries on with patience and finally becomes free. the\u000aclimax is absolutely spellbinding and will leave you aghast.it is a\u000atruly great movie and i was aghast at finding out that this movie was a\u000afailure in the box office.BUT NOW ALMOST EVERYONE RECOGNIZES THIS MOVIE\u000aFOR WHAT IT TRULY IS - A MASTERPIECE OF STORYTELLING.\u000a

V\u000aI was reluctant to see this movie - thought it was just another prison\u000amovie - and I was certainly tired of mindless violence. I was channel\u000asurfing one evening - and stumbled across this movie. I watched a few\u000aminutes, thinking I would change channels at the first commercial.\u000aAlmost 2 hours later - after seeing the end - I sat there...saying\u000a"Wow". That was a great movie. I have since recommended it to friends\u000aand family...it has grown in popularity due to word of mouth - and\u000acertainly deserves its spot at the top. Morgan Freeman put on a\u000amasterful performance, as did Tim Robbins. The way their friendship\u000adevelops and the interplay with the other inmates - a wonderful story.If you have not watched this movie yet - put preconceived notions\u000aaside, sit down, and enjoy the journey!\u000a

V\u000aThere have been many cases in film history when a film is terrific do\u000ato the actors. Then there are some films are great because of what was\u000awritten. With The Shawshank redemption, IMDb's favorite film, in works\u000ain both cases. The acting is superb, and the film is incredibly well\u000awritten and very justified.Tim Robbins plays Andy Dufrense, a banker who has been accused of\u000amurdering his wife and her lover. So he is sent to Shawshank prison,\u000awhere he experience's lots of things. He forms a bond with Red(played\u000aterrificly by Morgan Freeman). The warden(played by Bob Gunton) hates\u000ahim. He is raped. And all of this is leading to his escape after being\u000ain there for over twenty years.The Shawshank redemption, which is based on a shot story by Stephen\u000aKing, is one of the most interesting films ever made. It'a also one of\u000athe best films ever made too. What is one way to tell: When you hear\u000aMorgan Freeman's narration, you know you're in good hands.The acting is explosive. Everyone does such a good job. The Shawshank\u000aredemption is a little long, but the length is tolerable. Mainly\u000abecause from the opening scene the film has you hooked. Morgan Freeman\u000agives the better performance of the two, but the duo of Robbins and\u000aFreeman is once in a lifetime.The Shawshank redemption was an Oscar upset. It was nominated for\u000aseven, including Best picture, Best actor(Morgan Freeman) and best\u000awriting. And it lost best picture to Forrest Gump, which is also a\u000agreat movie. 94 was the year of Pulp fiction also. Another Oscar upset.\u000aI prefer Pulp fiction, but The Shawshank redemption is still one of the\u000abest films ever made.The Shawshank redemption:A+\u000a

V\u000aThis is a very, very, very, great film. It's my all time favorite.\u000aFirst of all the acting is f**king great. My favorite actor in the\u000aentire film is easily Morgan Freeman. He should have won that Oscar!\u000aThe fact that he didn't is a f**king disgrace. Now the music to this\u000amovie is not to memorable but is still great and sets the mood for the\u000afilm. Now the story line is brilliant. Andy Dufresne is accused of the\u000amurder of the wife and her secret lover, so he is sentenced to\u000aShawshank State Prison. There he develops a friendship with a prisoner\u000anamed Red. The sets in this movie are great. As expected. So in the end\u000athis is a great movie and you should really check it out.\u000a

The narrative is always\u000aengrossing, the source elements of Andy's secret are carefully placed\u000awithout exciting attention, and you are delighted when events pan out\u000aas they do.Then Darabont adapts it, and a damn good yarn becomes something\u000aspecial. Part of this is the adaptation - a sensitive simplification,\u000apart of it is the casting, which is pitch perfect (Morgan Freeman's Red\u000awas always an Irish redhead when I read the story - now I can't read it\u000awithout seeing Morgan Freeman). And most of it, I think, is the\u000adirection.The story unfolds in unhurried fashion, with us being unsure of Andy's\u000aguilt for much of the movie, but with a gradually building sense of\u000ainjustice at the way those in power in the system can treat him (and\u000aothers) unfairly. The secret doesn't come at the end, but at about the\u000athree quarters mark, and brings with it a huge emotional kick. And then\u000athe story is allowed to make its own way into a gentle and perfect end.This is, without any doubt, one of the most spiritually uplifting films\u000aI have ever seen.\u000a

V\u000aHi, I heard details about this movie first time two years ago from a\u000afriend. Before that in some movie channels I used to see the title been\u000ashown but never saw it. A jail movie....slow..not for me.I was in\u000acollege those days in the nineties. In 2007 when my friend told me that whenever he feel sad or down he\u000athinks of this movie and moves on. I replied back 'for me its rocky',\u000ahe asked if I have seen it and when I told him that I did not, the only\u000aanswer he had was it..watch it and then compare it. Now in 2009 with the recession going on, lots of trouble in work and\u000atensions of home and personal life for me. While changing channels, I\u000achanced upon this movie which had started and I had lost some ten\u000aminutes. I did not change the channels later and saw it in complete. The only\u000areaction was tears in my eyes in the end and called my family and close\u000afriends. It was a shaking experience, and I got my answer....I needed to get out\u000aof my jail. I sent mails to my friends about the movie and review, few had seen it\u000aalready and many did not. Result, more people watched it...and guess\u000awhat I for the first time rated in this website for the movie. ..AND i expect some of my friends also did it. This is the reason why after 15 years this movie is still alive because\u000aof its human spirit story....with more followers than fans. I hope that answers some of your doubts...... This movie is for those who are busy dying......and now know its\u000aimportant to get busy living.\u000a

V\u000aI am so happy to see this film top 1 in IMDb. It deserves to be there.\u000a"The Shawshank Redempion" appears in 1994, I think this year was full\u000aof amazing pictures. It lost Oscars but gained recognition. This is a\u000agreat story about friendship and redemption. Frank Darabont's best\u000amovie for sure. Andy Dufresne is one of the greatest characters ever\u000amade in the cinema art. A guy who is innocent and get punished. This\u000afilm shows us that even our intention is a crime in a law world. No one\u000ais perfect, and no one can predict anything. We live by a scheme and\u000atrying to be fair. People will always make mistakes and the greatest\u000athing is to learn from them. I am waiting for movies which can touch me\u000alike this one but after year 2000 nothing close to that appears. There\u000awere great films about life and stuff but still it's a modification, a\u000acopy thereof what was before. I think until year 2000 most of valuable\u000athings in film art was told. It's a little sad but this kind of art\u000awill always be deep in my heart as a lesson and beauty how fantastic\u000apicture man create. I hope there will be at least couple movies in my\u000ashort life that leave so many emotions like "The Shawshank Redemption".\u000aIn XXI century it is a very hard thing to do. I am patient and have\u000apositive thinking that cinema didn't say the last words.\u000a

V\u000aIt is year 2009 and yet this movie is still the best movie I have ever\u000aseen. It truly and rightfully deserves to be the best movie of all\u000atimes. Story telling, acting, directing, anything that you can imagine\u000aabout a movie is so perfectly done. I believe everyone will have his\u000aown message from the movie but if you want to see a movie that tells\u000ahow important the role of hope in our life is, you are at the correct\u000aaddress. The atmosphere in the prison, the way people feel and the way\u000aall these things were put together in a two hours movie; there is\u000anothing to say. It is just exceptionally plain good. A must to see\u000amovie for everyone that carries a heart.\u000a

V\u000aI was literally HOOKED. No wonder this film is rated amongst the best\u000aever. This is definitely one of the best movies you will see your\u000aentire life. Morgan Freeman's narration was awesome. Tim Robbins\u000apowerfully illustrates the importance of HOPE. All the characters did a\u000asuperb job. This is surely one of my all time favourite movies. Its a\u000aclassic & a true masterpiece of cinema... Don't think! Just watch &\u000asavour it.I saw the following comment by someone and thought of adding it to\u000amine, I agree 100% to everything of the following: "Many people in this\u000aworld are unhappy. Most people in this world don't want to be unhappy.\u000aLots of people wish, pray and above all hope for that magic wand to\u000awave and wash them of their fears, losses, angers and pains once and\u000afor all. They see lots of other people seemingly in this magical state,\u000awhile they suffer. To borrow the words of another film, they're\u000awatching the bluebirds flying over the rainbow. Many unhappy people\u000ahave learned that the magic wand doesn't exist. They're not destined to\u000ajoin the bluebirds and fairy tales don't come true. It's not that no\u000aone lives happily ever after, it's just that they're not going to.\u000aThey're busy dying.In this film, or as some people have quite correctly said, this\u000afairytale, magic wands exist. And that magic wand is Andy Dufrense\u000aimitating Houdini. However this film is not about him. Neither is it\u000aabout the prison, the governor, the guard, the plot, the acting, the\u000acinematography, the script, the direction or the score. It's about Red.\u000aHe is the one who has become institutionally unhappy, he's not only\u000atrapped in a prison, not only has he given up on the idea of ever\u000aleaving, not only does he have no hope, he knows that if the miracle\u000awould ever happen to him, he couldn't cope. He's safe in his\u000aunhappiness and that security is what keeps him going. Hope is, as Red\u000asay, dangerous. The metaphor for a certain illness here is very clear\u000ato me and I know that a rather large number of people suffer from it. A\u000alarge proportion of those don't understand what's wrong, but they\u000acertainly can recognise a fellow sufferer. Those who are mercifully\u000auntouched by this illness definitely don't understand what's going on\u000ain those who do. They're too busy living."Just a little piece of advice to everyone who hated/disliked this film;\u000aBelieve me this film is made for multiple viewings...Don't hate this\u000aafter viewing it once or twice, give it at least more than 2 viewings\u000abefore you make up your mind. I'm POSITIVE it will become more and more\u000abetter after each viewing and probably you will end up loving it. If\u000anot, maybe it was just not your Cup Of Tea. I hope this film satisfies\u000aeveryone and I really don't care if its No.1 on the IMDb or outside\u000aTop250. Its not fair to hate a film because your favourite is not above\u000ait in the rankings!Its a deeply satisfying movie that makes you understand the importance\u000aof HOPE.9.8/10P.S. Technically{all round film-making} it may not be the greatest\u000amovie of all-time{that honor can go to Godfather/LOTR:ROTK/Star Wars\u000a4,etc.} BUT it certainly goes down in my book as one of the finest and\u000aa movie to savour for ages.\u000a

V\u000aThe Shawshank Redemption is an excellent film from director Frank\u000aDarabont whose admirable in making this story based on a book by\u000aStephen King. Tim Robbins gives a great performance as Andy Dufresne\u000aand Morgan Freeman is equally impressive as Ellis Boyd "Red" Redding\u000atwo imprisoned men looking for redemption who bond after many years\u000awhile dealing with not only the abusive corrupt prison guards but the\u000aviolent fellow prisoners amongst them as well. Robbins and Freeman had\u000agood chemistry together which made their growing friendship that much\u000amore believable on the screen. The rest of the cast including Bob\u000aGunton, Clancy Brown, William Sadler, Gil Bellows, and James Whitmore\u000aare effective as the supporting characters in their limited screen\u000atime. The pacing was a little slow at times and the running time of 142\u000aminutes made the film feel a bit long but the rest made up for it's few\u000aflaws. Overall despite it's flaws The Shawshank Redemption is\u000adefinitely a must see a movie that can't be missed. It has a compelling\u000astory, character development, drama, some humor, and exceptional\u000aperformances by the cast (especially Robbins and Freeman) who make this\u000aone of the best books by Stephen King that was made into a movie. Well\u000adone. Much better than expected.\u000a

V\u000aSeriously, if ever there's a film that people should be forced to\u000awatch, it's this. The acting in it is truly perfect, the storyline in\u000avery, very well written and the ending is one of the cleverest (and\u000amost misleading) endings I have ever witnessed. This film can (and\u000awill) be enjoyed by people of all ages (relatively - check parents\u000aguide for suitability), and will keep you in suspense for the full\u000aduration. Unlike in most other Hollywood films, the twists in the\u000astoryline are very well executed and it is in no ways cheesy or cheap.\u000aMorgan Freeman gives the performance of his life without making his\u000afellow actors over-act. The Shawshank Redemption blows every other\u000aprison dramas out of the water. See it at all costs.\u000a

V\u000aThere are only a few words I have to say: Every time I watch that film,\u000aI have to cry. There are not many films, which get this result. Must\u000ahave something to do with the direction of Frank Darabont. And the\u000aacting of the stars is just brilliant. As a matter of fact, I don't see\u000aMorgan Freeman and Tim Robbins playing just another role. I only see\u000atwo Persons: Andy and Red For a long time I had the problem that when I\u000asaw Tim Robbins in another movie I thought of Andy Dufresne But now I\u000awill write something about the story: Of course I have read the\u000aoriginal story written by Stephen King. It was, in a way different. It\u000ahas not that deep meaning that is perceptible in the movie. When I\u000athink about this friendship between the two men... The sentence "Get\u000abusy livin or get busy dyin", well in a way it shaped my whole live.\u000aThis is definitely the best film I have ever seen\u000a

V\u000aThe Shawshank Redemption is one of the most touching and greatest\u000amovies I have ever seen. The movie is based on the novella Rita\u000aHayworth and the Shawshank Redemption by Stephen King. Unlike most of\u000ahis novels King didn't write a horror story but instead a inspiring\u000atale of hope in unlikely places. Overseeing the transition from book to\u000abig screen is Frank Darabont who in his director debut scores a home\u000arun with this movie.Not only does the plot pull you in but the actors do as well. Tim\u000aRobbins and Morgan Freeman do a fantastic job as the 2 central\u000acharacters and as friends. Bob Gunton is great in the part of the\u000avillain as the evil warden. The directing, cast, and plot all combine\u000ato make the movie awesome.The plot of the movie revolves around Andy Dufresne a man who is\u000aimprisoned for life for a crime he did not commit. Over time Andy\u000abecomes friends with Red an inmate who runs the business of smuggling\u000ain things into the prison. The story then follows the 2 and how they\u000ahandle prison life.Years go by but Andy continues to speak of hope. Ultimately Andy will\u000acommit unbelievable acts in a touching story that is truly\u000ainspirational. The message the story delivers is to never give up\u000ahoping. The climax of the movie is fantastic and the ending is one of\u000athe greatest in film history.Overall the Shawshank Redemption remains one of the greatest films of\u000aall time.\u000a

V\u000aThis movie is poetry. For those of you who've ever felt the way poetry\u000arolls off of the tongue, you'll understand what I mean when I say this.The first thing that makes this movie great is Morgan Freeman's ability\u000ato narrate the way he does. His soft, yet ruff voice provides the\u000aaudience with the belief that this man has endured many years of\u000ahardships and has gained wisdom and experience through trial and error.\u000aHe is a natural story teller, so his ability as a narrator is natural\u000aand smooth; not forced, like so many other actors.Tim Robbins displays his acting ability beautifully and captures the\u000aaudience with an intense amount of emotion, which seems to resonate in\u000ahis eyes. The genius and wisdom of the character he portrays is a\u000afascinating thing to watch unfold, as the story lays itself out, like a\u000aposter of Rita Hayworth.To say that this movie gives the audience hope would be unfair because\u000athis movie makes the audience want to live, love, experience life for\u000aall of its pleasures and its faults. It makes one appreciate the simple\u000athings and slow down a bit, to admire that which we pass a hundred\u000atimes a day, but never truly see.To describe this movie as "great" would be an understatement because it\u000ais so much more than that. While it is brutal and realistic, it\u000aportrays humanity at our best and our worst, providing the audience\u000awith a mirror in which to reflect what lies within. By the time the\u000acredits roll, we're left speechless...and at the same time, wanting to\u000ashare this masterpiece with those we love and cherish.Everyone should see this movie at least once in a lifetime to make us\u000aappreciate everything we have. Who would have thought someone could\u000acapture humanity this way? I guess a picture really is worth a thousand\u000awords......\u000a

V\u000aThis is beyond doubt my favourite movie of all-time. I am a Morgan\u000aFreeman fan and apart from Driving Miss Daisy, i have loved all his\u000amovies that i have seen. The Shawshank Redemption stands above all. I\u000athink it is a great movie with a sad overall story but a happy and just\u000aending. The only other prison movie i like as much is the classic Clint\u000aEastwood movie Escape from Alcatraz. The Shawshank Redemption has long\u000abeen my favourite movie and even though i have the DVD, i still watch\u000awhen it is on TV. 15 years since its release and i still haven't seen\u000aanything i like more. I would recommend this movie to everyone and if\u000ayou haven't seen it yet, you must be living in a cave or something. If\u000ayou are in a cave, get out and go see this fantastic movie. 10/10\u000a

V\u000aWhen Shawshank begins, for about the first two minutes it seems nothing\u000amore than a made-for-TV movie. However, as the story progresses you\u000afind out how amazing it really is. Yet how can a film that contains\u000arape, beatings and suicide make you feel so good at the end? Frank\u000aDarabont manages to do this so well. The Green Mile gives you a warm\u000afeeling at the ending, but not like this does. I just love the way it\u000afollows the subplot of Brooks right up until he kills himself. How\u000atouching that was to see an old man, let out of prison but without\u000aroutine. He belonged in prison, not in the outside world.You forget at times that you are watching a movie. It sucks you in and\u000amoves you. If you haven't seen Shawshank you have missed out on one of\u000athe finest movies ever made. But don't worry - you're not beyond\u000aredemption! Watch it!\u000a

V\u000aThis movie is one that gives to wit the most part of being happy in\u000athis life. It is true that you might not be lucky enough in life but\u000aeven in the midst of crap, even when all your life has crumbled over\u000ayour face, hope is still your last hope.One night he caught his wife cheating and was thrown in jail for a\u000amurder that he had not committed and after all that he got raped! What\u000awould you have done had you been in his shoes? keep on hoping? Well,\u000aAndy not only had hope, he gave hope to his fellow prisoners. The\u000abrilliant Morgan Freeman gives the cherry on the top in this movie and\u000aif he weren't in this movie, the movie would have lacked something for\u000asure.There are scenes and lines that you will never forget in this movie and\u000aI have commented on hundreds of movies but very few I gave the full 10\u000aout of 10 and this movie is one of those few.\u000a

V\u000aI saw this movie for the first time when it came on television earlier\u000athis month. After seeing it at #1 on the IMDb Top 250, I thought this\u000awould be a good opportunity to check it out. The story was gripping and\u000aI especially liked the pacing, with the story moving along at a quick\u000apace, covering years in a matter of minutes. The film was quite gritty\u000aand realistic throughout but started losing that quality as it started\u000afeeling more like a fairy tale towards the end.Although the story was initially focused on Andy, it later became quite\u000aapparent that Red was the true protagonist, who Morgan Freeman\u000aportrayed in one of his best performances to date. I believe Morgan\u000aFreeman deserved an Oscar for his performance, although he lost it to\u000aTom Hanks, who gave an equally great performance in Forrest Gump that\u000asame year.Although I disagree with The Shawshank Redemption's ranking at #1 on\u000athe IMDb Top 250, I believe it is worthy enough to at least be among\u000athe top 100 films. If I had to sum up the film in one sentence, I would\u000asay it is a very gripping and uplifting film to watch.8/10\u000a

The scene where Andy gets beer for his coworkers.\u000aAlso when he plays the two Italian singers on prison radio. Brooks last\u000afew days.And how Red comes to terms with his freedom. I recently\u000awatched it for the first time and can't believe how i could miss this\u000afor so long. I Also cant believe Morgan never won Oscar for this. I\u000acant think of any better performance than this.Truly deserves the\u000anumber one spot. Since last week i have watched it 3 times and plan to\u000awatch it again.

V\u000aI'll admit, I'd held off on seeing the Shawshank Redemption. I remained\u000aa little apprehensive; was this film as great as the masses of IMDb and\u000aparticularly world wide were saying? From the moment I began watching\u000athis film to the very end, I was kept completely in awe at how\u000abeautiful and amazing this film is.The Shawshank Redemption is a film set in a US Prison, following the\u000astory of Andy Dufrense who was sent to Shawshank for a crime in which\u000ahe did not forget. Here, he meets Ellis "Red" Redding (played by Morgan\u000aFreeman) an aged convict who, unlike the majority of the populace,\u000aaccepts that he is a guilty man. The two develop a friendship over the\u000alasting years, which evolves into what could be akin to brotherhood.The message of hope in this film is as inspirational as it is an\u000ainteresting concept. Despite being convicted, Andy undertakes a quest\u000ato become a free man once more, even if it means breaking the laws and,\u000aas shown later in the film, breaking out of ShawshankThe acting in this film is simply outstanding. Morgan Freeman,\u000aproviding both a character and the narration of said character,\u000aportrays his character in such a convincing way that one can't help but\u000afeel moved by his dialogue. Bob Gunton, who plays Warden Norton (an\u000aimmensely corrupt individual), passes himself off in such a brilliant\u000aperformance that I couldn't help but feel pure anger for the Warden\u000athroughout the movie.But perhaps what makes this movie so beautiful is the underlying\u000amessages. Despite being incarcerated for life without parole, Andy\u000amaintains hope, despite what the others say when he freely speaks of\u000ait. The evolving friendship of Red and himself delivers the message\u000athat not all criminals are rabid beasts, and that friendship can\u000aoutlast the grim depression of a prison. Though I am by no means proud\u000ato admit it, I felt myself become watery-eyed several times throughout\u000athe film, particularly the letter sent by Brooks before he commits\u000asuicide, climaxing in a tragic, heart-breaking scene.Wherever you are in the world, you must see this movie. It will most\u000acertainly change your life. It did mine.\u000a

V\u000aThe story of this film takes place over a twenty-year period between\u000a1947 and 1967. Andy Dufresne, a young banker from Portland, Maine, is\u000awrongly convicted of murdering his wife and her lover, and sentenced to\u000alife imprisonment. ("Shawshank" is the name of the prison where he\u000aserves his sentence). The prison is a brutal place, and Andy is\u000afrequently beaten and sexually assaulted by a gang of homosexual\u000ainmates called "The Sisters". Two things, however, help him to survive.\u000aOne is his friendship with another convict, Red, who has a reputation\u000afor being able to acquire almost any item and, for a price, to smuggle\u000ait into the prison. The other is his financial expertise, which he puts\u000ato good use, becoming a tax and financial adviser to the prison guards\u000aand even the Warden himself. As a reward for these services, Andy is\u000agiven a privileged job in the prison library and protection from\u000amolestation. To avenge their attacks on Andy, the leader of the\u000a"Sisters" is so badly beaten by the guards that he is crippled for\u000alife; Andy is not molested again.The Warden devises a scheme under which inmates are put to work on\u000alocal construction projects. The purpose of this is ostensibly to\u000aprepare them for life after they are released, but in reality he is\u000aexploiting their free labour for his own personal profit, and using\u000aAndy's financial skills to launder the proceeds. This arrangement seems\u000ato work to Andy's advantage, because of the extra privileges he is\u000agranted, but things change when a new young prisoner named Tommy\u000aWilliams is sent to Shawshank. Tommy has evidence that could secure\u000aAndy's release; a former cellmate in another prison has confessed to\u000ahim that he committed the murders for which Andy was convicted. Tommy\u000aconfides this secret to the Warden who, fearing that his illegal\u000aschemes will be revealed should Andy ever be released, arranges to have\u000aTommy murdered by a corrupt guard.There is a long history of American prison films, including the likes\u000aof "I am a Fugitive from a Chain Gang", "Cool Hand Luke", "Brubaker"\u000aand the more recent "The Last Castle". (Frank Darabont was later to\u000adirect another prison film, "The Green Mile", based, like "The\u000aShawshank Redemption" on a Stephen King story). Most of these were made\u000awith a liberal social agenda in mind, aiming to expose the harsh prison\u000aconditions and thereby inspire their reform. "The Shawshank Redemption"\u000afalls, to some extent, within this tradition; it is made from a\u000abasically liberal viewpoint and vividly depicts the brutality of prison\u000alife, although the fact that it is a period piece, set several decades\u000ain the past, might suggest that social issues were not the filmmakers'\u000asole concern. Perhaps more important are the analysis of the nature of\u000afreedom and of the relationship between Andy and Red.The word "prison", from the French "pris" ("taken"), merely indicates a\u000aplace where captives are held, and the authorities, especially in\u000aAmerica, prefer to describe many prisons by some more positive term\u000asuch as "penitentiary" or "reformatory" which implies their purpose of\u000arehabilitating criminals. Shawshank, a prison where the Warden and\u000aguards are at least as crooked as the inmates, has precisely the\u000aopposite effect. Andy goes in innocent of any crime and comes out\u000aguilty of being an accessory to corruption and fraud. Yet, despite his\u000ainvolvement in the Warden's dishonesty, Andy retains a certain\u000aintegrity; he refuses to give up hope and refuses to allow himself to\u000abe beaten by the system. Although he is in prison he has found a sort\u000aof freedom. A key moment comes when he defies the guards to play a\u000aMozart aria over the prison loudspeakers for all the inmates to hear- a\u000areminder of spiritual values even in the harshest of environments.Red faces a different problem. He fears that he has become so\u000ainstitutionalised that he will be unable to survive freedom, as\u000ahappened to another long-term prisoner who committed suicide shortly\u000aafter his release. In prison, his role as the "fixer" who can obtain\u000aanything, be it a packet of cigarettes, a rock hammer or a poster of\u000aRita Hayworth, makes him the king of the inmates. (These latter two\u000aitems will play an important role in the plot). On the outside he will\u000abe just another ex-con trying to make ends meet in a dead-end job.\u000aParadoxically, he is more free in jail than he will be on the outside.\u000aI won't give away the ending, but it involves Andy repaying Red's\u000aprevious kindnesses by showing him how he can be free in all senses of\u000athe word.The film was not a great box office success when first released but has\u000asince acquired a status as one of the classics of the modern American\u000acinema; it has now supplanted "The Godfather" as number one on IMDb's\u000aTop 250 list. The film would perhaps not be number one on my personal\u000alist, but it is a fine one and would certainly be in my top 250,\u000aperhaps the top 100. Its two stars, Tim Robbins as Andy and Morgan\u000aFreeman as Red, are both excellent. Its initial lack of success may\u000ahave had something to do with its rather clumsy title. "Shawshank" is\u000anot a word that will mean anything to the average person (according to\u000aone story Darabont was once asked how his "rickshaw" film was going)\u000aand "redemption", except in technical legal contexts, normally has a\u000areligious connotation. This is not an explicitly religious film;\u000aindeed, in its portrayal of Warden Norton as a sanctimonious,\u000aBible-bashing hypocrite, it can be seen as critical of religion.\u000aNevertheless, the word "redemption" is perhaps appropriate in this\u000acontext, after undergoing the hell of Shawshank Andy and Red manage to\u000afind a sort of secular redemption. It may be this message of hope that\u000aaccounts for the film's continuing popularity. 9/10\u000a

V\u000aThis is without a doubt one of the finest films of the last 20 years. I\u000athink that if it had been released with more fanfare and didn't have\u000asuch great competition that year, it might have won for Best Picture.\u000aThis film has such a powerful presence that it has a life of it's own\u000aapart from the cast, score, cinematography, etc., all of which are\u000adeservedly great. This is one of those movies that you can switch to\u000awhen you are channel surfing, and stop and watch the rest of it, no\u000amatter what part of the movie you are at. Perhaps The Godfather and\u000aJaws are a couple of others that do that for me, and it never gets old,\u000ano matter how many times you watch it. One thing that disappoints me\u000aregarding this film is what has happened to the director, Frank\u000aDarabont. Unfortunately, he has never come close to achieving the\u000agreatness of Shawshank with his subsequent films. I thought The Green\u000aMile was good, but it didn't hold a candle to Shawshank. I was also\u000avery disappointed in The Mist. I sincerely hope that he is able to\u000arecapture some of the magic of Shawshank Redemption in a future film,\u000abecause he definitely does have the proved ability to do so.\u000a

V\u000aIn short supply are the movies which act as cathartic catalysts on a\u000asecond \u2013or-plus viewing as compellingly and strongly as on the first\u000aviewing. The other night, overpowered by feelings of despondency and\u000aennui, I went to flick through my small collection of movies and on an\u000aimpulse I picked up The Shawshank Redemption. I savored every moment of\u000athe movie even more than my first time a couple of years ago. I chalk\u000ait up to its beautifully crafted story, its virtuoso and powerhouse\u000aperformances, and its underlying themes of hope, resolve, and ultimate\u000asalvation. This time, in his feature directorial debut Frank Darabont\u000ahas tapped into the wellspring of King the horrible's and fashioned a\u000ajuggernaut of a prison drama out of his novella Rita Hayworth and the\u000ashawshank Redemption. This movie stands out among other prison flicks\u000ain that it flies in the face of conventions. Contrary to our\u000aexpectations and cheapened tastes, Shawshank does not intend to explore\u000athe horrors of prison life as its fulcrum but the way its inhabitants\u000aclutch at straws and pull out all stops to extricate themselves from\u000athe shackles of the gloom of their claustrophobic mental incarceration\u000aagainst all the odds turns out to be its thematic pull. And the movie\u000apulls it off big time. Among a mosaic of characters, events,\u000ashenanigans and skullduggery, the movie mainly delves into the\u000afriendship struck up between two lifers. The friendship between Andy\u000aDufresne, played convincingly by Tim Robbins, who is accused of\u000amurdering his wife and her lover and sentenced to serve two concurrent\u000alives, and the veteran Red, the brilliant Morgan Freeman, carries the\u000aemotional and inspirational mood of the movie. When a busload of\u000aprisoners arrive at the max-security state penitentiary of Shawshank,\u000athe other felons bet on who is going to burst into tears at the first\u000anight of prison life. Red ups his antes on the seemingly brittle fresh\u000afish Andy, who was a respectable banker in the outside and is like a\u000afish out of water among a bunch of thick-skinned miscreants. Red loses\u000asince Andy turns out to be more redoubtable and impermeable than any\u000aprison wall several feet thick. Little do the fellow prisoners realize\u000aat first glance what an enigmatic character he is. For the first months\u000ahe says next to nothing, meanders through other prisoners in the prison\u000ayard minding his own business and the movie speaks through by-turn\u000ahumorous, poignant and thought-provoking narration of the omniscient\u000aRed who is known for smuggling things in and charging a 20% markup for\u000athe services he provides. However, Red's omniscience is not\u000aall-encompassing and Godly enough to bore into the Sphinx-like mind of\u000athe introverted Andy even after 19 years. On a tarring occasion, he\u000aoverhears a guard complaining about the taxes he has to pay for an\u000ainheritance, he screws up his courage to offer him his expert advice on\u000atax evasion. Now, he is treated as a special guest since he cooks the\u000abooks for the prisons' powers that be who have hit pay dirt. His\u000afinancial legerdemain proves to be a double-edged sword. Now he is the\u000avictim of his own success. A newcomer is willing to testify to his\u000ainnocence in the court but the warden regards his accountant too\u000avaluable to be expendable. Andy survives several assaults and rapes. He\u000anever gives up. He never cracks under pressure. Life is very simple to\u000ahim: get busy living or get busy dying. He makes the first choice and\u000aremains true to it through thick and thin. He lives with hope as his\u000asource of salvation. The emotional pull of the movie owes a great deal\u000ato the spirited and flawless performances of all the cast members.\u000aMorgan Freeman effortlessly inhabits his character as a real free man.\u000aTim Robbins is superlative as a quintessential embodiment of hope and\u000ainspiration. James Whitmore, as the institutionalized prison trusty who\u000ais suicidal in the outside, turns in a superlative performance. Hats\u000aoff to all the performers. The Shawshank Redemption is a prime example\u000aof the gap between the box office performance of a movie and its\u000apopularity. This movie famously bombed in the box office, barely\u000acovering its budget. But overtime it gained in such popularity that it\u000ahas snatched the coveted toppest ranking place in IMDb from such hot\u000afavorites and topdogs like Godfather, Forrest Gump and Pulp Fiction,\u000athe last two of which eclipsed Shawshank in 1994 Academy Awards.\u000aPerhaps in 1994 the movie lacked the requisite word of mouth that it is\u000aenjoying now. All in all, Shawshank is a compulsively watchable movie\u000awith bits of pleasure withheld in every watching only to be relished on\u000anext occasions.\u000a

V\u000aVery few movies that made me cry ... and (The Shawshank Redemption) is\u000acertainly one of them. I remember when I first went to see this movie\u000ain my freshman year in college. The movie made me appreciate freedom\u000aand true friendship.Very powerful picture indeed and each actor deserved an Oscar for their\u000agreat performance. It is sad that the movie did not get the true scale\u000aof recognition it deserved, but being on the IMDb top 250 movies of all\u000atime based on people's votes is a great way to show the well earned\u000aappreciation.If you did not watch this movie yet, then you missed a lot!\u000a

V\u000aEvery time I watch The Shawshank Redemption it reinforces the fact that\u000ait is my favorite movie of all time. But certainly as entertaining a\u000afilm that it is, being a personal favorite does not necessarily make it\u000aa great film or dare I saythe greatest film ever made.But what then makes a film great? First and foremost, if it sets out to\u000aentertain the general public, it must do that (and Shawshank certainly\u000adoes that). Its pure entertainment value is essentially a stipulation\u000ain its inclusion in the great IMDb "greatest movie" debate. The serious\u000anature of its central plot pointsa wrongly convicted murderer who\u000aassists the corrupt warden as means to affect his own escapeis\u000acontrasted by some truly funny scenes. Although by no means a comedy,\u000athe splendid screenplay is wrought with witty dialog. There's nothing\u000afancy about this filmno special effects, spectacular scenery or even a\u000abunch of pretty women. No, its just the telling of a story, mostly\u000athrough the narration of Morgan Freeman's character, Red, that almost\u000alulls viewers into believing that nothing really interesting or\u000aimportant is going to happen here. But after all of the subtle plot\u000atwists I think what makes this film great for me is I feel like I'm\u000aactually sharing in Andy's redemption. Now if that isn't what they\u000ateach in Film-making 101 then they should just close up the classroom.Ultimately, there cannot be a single motion picture that is the\u000a"greatest film of all time" because as art, and in an art form as\u000avaried as cinema, greatness must be measured by each individual.\u000aGreatness, as beauty, truly is in the eye of the beholder. But in this\u000abeholder's eyes I think The Shawshank Redemption is truly the greatest\u000afilm I have ever seen.\u000a

V\u000aI have never seen such an amazing film since I saw The Shawshank\u000aRedemption. Shawshank encompasses friendships, hardships, hopes, and\u000adreams. And what is so great about the movie is that it moves you, it\u000agives you hope. Even though the circumstances between the characters\u000aand the viewers are quite different, you don't feel that far removed\u000afrom what the characters are going through.It is a simple film, yet it has an everlasting message. Frank Darabont\u000adidn't need to put any kind of outlandish special effects to get us to\u000alove this film, the narration and the acting does that for him. Why\u000athis movie didn't win all seven Oscars is beyond me, but don't let that\u000asway you to not see this film, let its ranking on the IMDb's top 250\u000alist sway you, let your friends recommendation about the movie sway\u000ayou.Set aside a little over two hours tonight and rent this movie. You will\u000afinally understand what everyone is talking about and you will\u000aunderstand why this is my all time favorite movie.\u000a

V\u000aI have seen this movie a few times. Each time with the same hope and\u000aenthusiasm as before. The main story is obviously Andy's. His fears,\u000ahis hopes and dreams... his struggle to remain sane. As a rock hammer,\u000aAndy chisels the prison around him. But this is more than the story of\u000aAndy and his way out of prison. It's a tale of society, men trying to\u000asurvive trying to remain human and civilized. Red is a gentleman\u000amasterfully played by on of the greatest actors ever. His character\u000aadds depth to the story and makes room for hope, for friendship. All\u000athose around Andy benefit from his morals, his intelligence, his\u000aperseverance, his will not to let go of himself. At first we see men\u000awith no hope, no way out of their walls. Brooks is an unfortunate part\u000aof it. But Andy changes lives. Some study, some begin to plan life\u000aoutside the walls. Even the guards look up to a man as righteous as\u000athey come. Every time I see it I get the same warm feeling as the first\u000atime I saw it without actually knowing what it was, what it is... It's\u000aonly fitting it sits on top of the charts and if that makes people\u000awatch it, it's just enough as it will bring them the same feeling again\u000aand again. I movie to watch once a year or whenever you need a little\u000a"pick-me-up".\u000a

V\u000aDespite being a very long movie, and not very action packed for that\u000amatter, I found 'The Shawshank Redemption' one of the most entertaining\u000amotion pictures I have ever stumbled upon. And I think that the\u000aentertainment value a certain film may hold is largely over-looked\u000aamong film critics, and most people who watch films with a critical\u000aeye. But I hold it as probably the single most important feature in\u000amovies in most cases. And by entertainment value I do not only mean how\u000ait feels when you are watching the movie, but also the picture it\u000aleaves on your mind that makes you want to see it again, and that you\u000acan look back at and actually experience the feeling you gain from\u000aactually watching the film. And this is where 'Shawshank' really\u000ashines. The 2 hours just went by, and left me with a really good\u000afeeling after wards for some time.But the other features should not be ignored either in any case. I\u000areally like the way 'Shawshank' makes you think. For me, it was mostly\u000aabout how good I actually have it, and about life in general. It really\u000amade me want to better my ways in all sorts of ways. But unfortunately\u000ait wont last forever, but that's why it's good you can see the movie\u000aagain. And when you do, it will still have the same impact on you as it\u000adid the first time around.\u000a

V\u000aMy story is one of fate. I went to the video store expecting to get\u000aTerminator II on laserdisc. It was out, and out of desperation to rent\u000asomething, I asked for what was new. I was given the "Shawshank\u000aRedemption". I had never heard of it, quite honestly, but I gave it a\u000atry but was not expecting much but two hours of "time pass".The first time through watching it, I thought it was good. Nothing\u000aextraordinary. But something made me watch it again. And I was hooked.\u000aI can't explain it, but this movie gets better every time you watch it.\u000aI ended up watching it about 8 times in that 4 day timespan.Watch this movie, as your bucket list of things to do in life. You\u000areally have not lived till you have seen it.I admit to being completely obsessed by the movie, owning it on every\u000amedium imaginable, and having all the books and posters about it. But\u000ado not let my obsession dissuade you. I do not impress easily, but I\u000acan tell you this is simply the greatest movie ever made in cinema.Every moment and every dialog of this movie fits in perfectly to create\u000athe greatest masterpiece in American cinema.\u000a

V\u000aThis film (or may be masterpiece) changed the whole outlook of mine\u000atowards life. The characters played by Morgan Freeman and Tim Robbins\u000awere so real and so closed to my heart that I cried and I laughed with\u000athem while watching it for the first time.We learn from books, we learn from our parents, we learn from our\u000afriends and we learn from movie like "The Shawshank Redemption".Once\u000aupon a time, I was going through a bad phase of my life and bit\u000adepressed also. Then some suggested me to watch this. What happened\u000anext was simply miracle. The pain endured by Tim Robbins was no less\u000athan mine. But it was hope that kept him alive. That infused a new joy\u000ain my life and I achieved success in very little amount of time. The\u000adialogues are simply straight yet touching.The movie has universal appeal - It can move anyone because characters\u000aplayed by Freeman and Robbins are so close to heart.Double thumbs up to Stephen King and Frank Darabont for teaming up and\u000aoffering this life changing piece of cinema.This movie was not made for Oscars (although it grabbed multiple\u000anominations) and not for critics (some critics ridicule about its\u000anumber position in IMDb 250). It was made for common people like us.Humble salute to all who were directly or indirectly associated with\u000athis all time classic.\u000a

V\u000aMuch has been written and praised (deservedly so) about "The Shawshank\u000aRedemption." The fact that it's #1 on this list gives me faith in\u000ahumanity. Instead of talking about its obvious care with excellent\u000awriting, directing, editing and cinematography, I'll just say how much\u000athe film has meant to me personally. Its message of hope and, above\u000aall, perseverance, kept me going through many of life's travails. I\u000athink I responded to how it dealt with the day-to-day grind of life\u000a(albeit in dramatic fashion)and even the stress of boredom. The other\u000athing it demonstrated was how profoundly one person can affect another\u000awithout even saying much to them. After all, Andy and Red only have one\u000atrue baring-their-souls conversation in 19 years together (One of the\u000agreatest scenes in the history of movies, by the way). Yet we are fully\u000aaware of how much these two meant to each other and how moved we are\u000awhen they are reunited. It's a real spiritual journey (visually as\u000awell); almost like Red has died at the end (leaving Hell/Shawshank) and\u000ais reborn in Zihuatanejo (Heaven)to be rejoined with the one person who\u000aunderstands him. Just a marvelous, life-changing experience for me. My\u000athanks to all who've supported and created this movie. It will live on\u000aand be remembered throughout the years as one of the pinnacles of human\u000aachievement.\u000a

V\u000aWhy Shawshank Redemption isn't rated 9.9/10 is beyond me.What has caused me to reflect and comment on this film is the small\u000athings...99.9% of movies miss them. A movie is a photographic montage\u000aof images with sound and is meant to represent a story. Humans have\u000aalways enjoyed stories from time immemorial huddled around fires in\u000acaves to modern things like FaceBook or YouTube, it's all about\u000astories.Shawshank has many small instances that Frank Darabont included like\u000awhen Red leaves a small note to Andy with a free poster when he returns\u000afrom the hospital/isolation. Another small instance is when Andy gives\u000aRed the harmonica, it could easily not have been filmed but it touches\u000aeveryone with its deeper meanings. It's a collage of many small\u000ainstances that make it meaningful and memorable, over and over again.I am convinced that's why everyone loves this movie and watch it\u000arepeatedly, it's the small things that touch you. How many movies have\u000agiven you the most important small message of all...of hope...it's the\u000amost powerful of goals we can have, hope really sets you free.\u000a

V\u000aI'm a big Stephen King fan, and I wondered if this movie would be a\u000agood adaptation. Some of King's work has been great on film, but others\u000ahave not translated well. No fear. As others have noted, this is an\u000aamazing film that provides inspiration and reconnects the viewer with\u000athe inner core of humanity. The script is great, the directing is\u000awonderful, and the performances are unbelievably good. To give you some\u000aidea of just HOW GOOD this is, the first time I saw it was on an\u000aairline. Problem was, the headset didn't work and there weren't any\u000aother headsets. The movie is so good that I couldn't stop watching\u000ait--and this is a movie heavy on dialogue. If you've never seen it, do\u000ayourself a favor. NOTE: It's even better with the sound!!!\u000a

V\u000aDon't know how many will ever see the 2,086th comment in this site -\u000abut just saw a friend's DVD of this film, again. I had missed it due to\u000abeing in Europe on an extended business trip when it played first-run,\u000aand caught some portions of it a few years later, and then completely\u000asometime following.This was the third or fourth time I'd seen it straight through, and it\u000ais one of those very rare films which is as good - maybe even better -\u000aon successive viewings.Robbins, Freeman, Gunton, and all of the remaining cast - whether in\u000alarger supporting roles or smaller - are outstanding, without a single\u000aexception.My friend is a computer whiz, with an IQ of probably 150, and\u000awidely-expert expert in this area. But he's so immersed in this realm,\u000athat whenever forced to use pen and paper (instead of mouse or\u000akeyboard) he does so on about the 5th-grade level. After the film (he\u000ahad bought the DVD, but had never seen it before) he stated he didn't\u000afeel the Robbins character could have pulled-off all the shenanigans\u000awith the money, from prison via mail (and perhaps sometimes using a\u000amessenger of the warden's) the way the film depicted -- whereas today,\u000aif such an inmate had a computer terminal available, it would be more\u000apossible.I told him I felt certain the opposite was true. In the era of the\u000astory, a very intelligent financially-adept individual - especially a\u000aformer whiz-kid bank V.P. - could have done what was shown even more\u000aeffectively and successfully than via computer today, with all the\u000afirewalls, and in-house computer nerds any bank has. Someone with both\u000atremendous financial and hacker ability might - but not as easily as\u000aTim did, during a period when signatures and figures on paper and the\u000alike were the governing elements.This aspect is one of the most critical and climactic for the story and\u000aits very satisfying ending. And Gunton, a tremendous actor who has done\u000amany sympathetic characters, presents one of the best performances\u000aportraying a truly evil person - more so for the quieter and\u000a"nasty-nice" elements of this portrayal. He juxtaposes quiet demeanor,\u000aoften even pious, with completely selfish, vicious, amoral actions, as\u000awell as humanly possible, with his performance in this roleThis is a film for which the term "perfect piece of entertainment" does\u000anot exaggerate.\u000a

V\u000aShawshank Redemption gives the feel of a strong, firm and amazing story\u000athat can move people while sitting down to watch it. The characters are\u000amemorable. Morgan Freeman as Red will always be in my head. Tim Robbins\u000aand Any Dufrense, is amazing as well. Shawshank gives the audience a\u000ataste of a perfect movie. Movies like this don't come often. Movies\u000acome with strong stories, but acting, and flow of this story can mess\u000ait up. Shawshank doesn't disappoint. The acting is superb, and the flow\u000aof the story is unforgettable. Based on the Stephen King novel, Rita\u000aHayworth and the Shawshank Redemption, I'd say this is one of the\u000amovies where the film triumphs over the novel. The film also brings a\u000asense of humor, which is a very good tool for films like these, because\u000aif everything is serious, it's very possible that it might be killed.\u000aWell, people have their own opinion. One scene amazes me, and probably\u000ais one of my favorite scenes in the film is when the prisoners are\u000awatching Gilda, and they're all waiting for Rita Hayworth to do the\u000athing with her hair. It still makes me laugh and pleased, with the\u000aacting and reactions of the prisoner, and the beauty of Rita Hayworth\u000aherself. Shawshank Redemption is a one-of-a-kind film, where stories\u000acome in, and the film enlarges the story and puts it into a whole new\u000alevel. The excellent acting, and a great adapted screenplay makes this\u000amovie one of the greatest films ever in history.\u000a

Great performances (Tim Robbins & Freeman\u000aQualifying as one my favorite actors). The whole presentation has been\u000avery apt to the movie. But what is important is the strong message this\u000amovie transcends, i.e. of Hope, is truly recommendable.This movie deserves an intent watch by "all".

V\u000aWhen you look at IMDb's top 250 you see many famous and ambitious films\u000alike Star Wars, The Godfather, The Lord of the Rings and others. Not\u000asaying that these movies are bad (they are actually quite brilliant)\u000athey were made famous because of the publicity and the abilities these\u000afilms had in the time. Star Wars started the sci-fi age, The Godfather\u000amade people interested in the secret society of the Mafia and Lord of\u000athe Rings brought life into the fantasy genre again. But what really\u000amade these sublime films so popular was the publicity and the fantastic\u000aspecial effects which costed certain amounts of money. In 1994 Frank\u000aDarabont decided to have a go on one of Stephen King's novels, not\u000aknowing what would happen. They made a film that is honest and that\u000acontains (on the contrary to Star Wars etc.) a vital lesson, a meaning\u000aand a message to all who watch it.This movie is redefining cinema. No explosions. No heart-stopping\u000aexcitement. No, it's pure poetry, music and sublime acting. The\u000aoverwhelming and intriguing story introduces banker Andy Dufresne\u000a(played by Tim Robbins) who was falsely convicted for a double life\u000asentence in the heavily guarded establishment of Shawshank Prison. His\u000alife must go on and he makes friends with other inmates like Red\u000a(wonderfully acted out by Morgan Freeman) and Brooks Hatlen (James\u000aWhitmore brings tears to your eyes). Warden Norton (played immensely\u000aevil by Bob Gunton) and Captain Hadley (Clancy Brown) don't make Andy's\u000alife comfortable in the prison, but with Andy's unique skills he\u000amanages to win their attention and gratitude.This film has some terrific moments like the helicopter shot over the\u000aShawshank Prison and the stunningly beautiful scene where Andy locks\u000ahimself up in the Warden's office and plays Mozart to all the inmates.\u000aMorgan Freeman's raw voice makes this moment more powerful than any\u000aother moment in any other movie I ever saw. At the release of the film,\u000apeople criticised the film harshly and wasn't a big hit, certainly not\u000aat the box-office. But when the film appeared in the stores it became\u000aan enormous hit. And until this day, for over 4-5 years now I believe,\u000ait stands on the second place in the top 250, one place away from The\u000aGodfather.This is a film you have to see once in your life!\u000a

V\u000aI was at the video store with my girlfriend and we wanted to rent out a\u000afew movies. I decided that one of the films we should rent out is 'The\u000aShawshank Redemption'. I had always wondered why it had such good\u000aratings as well as being positioned at #2 in the IMDb Top 250, and I\u000athought I would see just how good the movie really was.When the film concluded in a way that I would have never conceded, I\u000asat there in front of the TV surprised and dumbfounded. When my\u000agirlfriend asked me what was wrong, I simply just said "That....is the\u000agreatest movie I have ever seen in my entire life." It was not just an\u000aordinary and clichéd film I was watching, it was art on the screen, 2\u000aand a half hours of extraordinary cinematography, unforgettable acting,\u000aand a plot so compelling, that you just did not want it to end. Morgan\u000aFreeman as Red and Tim Robbins as Andy are the perfect choices for\u000atheir respective roles. The prison setting is so daunting and visually\u000asatisfying, while the corruption by the warden and the guards is\u000adreadfully brutal yet extraordinarily eye popping. I normally dislike\u000asome movies that normally go for over 2 hours as I think they are just\u000adragging on, but Shawshank along with very few others kept me glued to\u000athe screen in suspense. I hung onto every scene and every word uttered\u000ain the entire film.'The Shawshank Redemption' is unique in its own little way, and it has\u000aaffirmed my belief that hope and courage through adversity is possible\u000aand rewarding. Not many movies are made like this, and I just hope that\u000athere is a movie like, but probably not as good as, 'The Shawshank\u000aRedemption' that will be made in this hostile and cruel 21st Century.\u000aMovies like this really change lives.10/10\u000a

V\u000aI myself, like most people, love this movie and whenever it got to the\u000aend where you see Andy and Red smiling and embracing on the beach it\u000aalways sent chills through my soul, but I realized that in addition to\u000athat sequence, where not a word is spoken between the two men, it's\u000athat 'deep blue ocean' that makes the ending so dramatic. I think with\u000athe exception of a few outdoor scenes in the movie where you see a\u000alittle sky, the bulk of the movie is shot in the drab gray tones of\u000aprison (cause prison is drab and gray), so when that BIG BLUE OCEAN\u000ahit's your eyes, it makes the whole experience of their freedom and the\u000afact that they never gave up hope that much more dramatic.Hope is definitely a good thing and quite possibly, the best of ALL\u000athings.\u000a

V\u000aAndy (superb Tim Robbins) is condemned to stay all his life in prison\u000adue to two murders he has not done. There, he will meet Red (Morgan\u000aFreeman, impressive, these is one of the best relation love/friendship\u000aof all the movies I've ever seen). Red understand perfectly Andy and\u000aguides him at the first moments, as we see Andy from Red's eyes, his\u000aloyalty and admiration. We understand all these only by his looks and\u000ahis moves, in one of the best parts of Freeman. Robbins play the part\u000aof a distant character, brave, righteous, intelligent, but as everyone,\u000aweak, frightened. It's like an angel in the depht of hell. The hardness\u000aof the prison and the corruption of the prison system is perfectly told\u000ato us by Darabont perfectly. Its realism is sometimes disgusting and\u000athe hardest scenes touches you at the depht of your heart. The film has\u000aa very high dramatic part, but in any moment becomes too sweety. Its\u000awonderful dialogues, its magnificent study of characters and their\u000apsychologies, the charisma of Robbin's character, well absolutely\u000aeverything helps that this film becomes part of the selected group of\u000aevery time masterpieces. There are two scenes that I've loved a lot.\u000aThe one where, Andy is able to listen, relaxed to a Mozart's Opera in\u000athe director prison's office (although being in prison, at that moment,\u000aAndy is free). And the other where, one of the prisoners, being very\u000aold and having spend almost all his life in prison, commits suicide as\u000ahe cannot get used to a life in freedom. However, despite all the\u000ahardness and the few holes to hope that there's in the movie, at the\u000aend there's always a little ray of light. The Shawshank Redemption is\u000athat, a chant for life, for our dreams... a masterpiece.\u000a

V\u000aThis is one of the best movies about "friendship" I've ever seen, also\u000aone of the best prison movies. I found it better than Robert Redford's\u000a"CASTLE". Morgan Freeman was perfect as usual and I can say that Tim\u000aRobbins reached the top of his performance and also his career. I wish\u000athis couple come together for another movie, the kind of it is not\u000aimportant I'm sure the spectators will have the same taste as before. I\u000awatched most of the films of Morgan Freeman and I can say this was the\u000abest of his, normally he prefers to play in films like "Seven","Kiss\u000athe girls","Along came a spider",... but I think he should think again\u000athat which kind of his films stay at the top of the charts...\u000a

V\u000aUndoubtedly one of the greatest movies I have ever seen. The\u000aoutstanding performances by Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman left me with\u000afeelings so profound of being in that prison with them. Be warned that\u000athe first half of the film is visually and psychologically confronting.The film deals with fundamental themes of friendship and hope whilst\u000adelivering some very powerful social commentary. I am left questioning\u000athe state of our justice system. We lock away these "threats to\u000asociety", alienate them and subject them to the most hostile and\u000aunnatural of environments. Then when they have served their life terms,\u000awe throw them back into society with the expectation for them to live\u000anormally and abide by values never once upheld or taught in their\u000afilthy prison cells. The Shawshank Redemption tells a very powerful\u000astory. A story that made me laugh and cry. It ignited just about every\u000ahuman emotion I could possibly experience in just over a two hour\u000aperiod of time.A truly amazing film, 10 out of 10 from me!\u000a

V\u000aTen Thumbs Up if I had them. Incredible story, incredible cast. I would\u000arate this as probably the best film I have ever seen and I have\u000aprobably seen it a hundred times on cable. I would have to say this\u000awould be Morgan Freemans best performance out of all of his films.\u000aThere should have been an Oscar for him. This film definitely beat out\u000a"Million Dollar Baby" for which he ultimately and finally received his\u000afirst Oscar. The Academy wasn't all there when "Shawshank" deserved its\u000adue. Robbins played a great part in this film and did an excellent job\u000ahowever Freeman carried the film. A true drama that shows the bond of\u000atwo people in horrible circumstances. Yes, this one is one to own, if\u000ayou don't have it...buy it. You wont be disappointed.\u000a

V\u000aIf you simply see this as a straightforward storytelling prison film,\u000athen it is excellent (10/10) because it truly gets you involved in its\u000amain character. It is an extremely enjoyable and compelling experience\u000awith a heartfelt and well-acted buddy-story at its core. It\u000adelicately--and sometimes brutally--juxtaposes Andy Dufresne's (Tim\u000aRobbins) good-natured character with the harshness of prison life,\u000aprojecting so much heart in doing so.However delightful as it is, The Shawshank Redemption has no allegories\u000aand no statements to make and it brought nothing new to cinema in\u000aeither style or substance. It had no revolutionary ideas or approaches\u000a- it's only a very safe buddy-story. A damn good one, but still just\u000athat. So it can impossibly be a film that will be remembered or\u000astudied, because what will it be remembered for? Friendship? Huh, neat.\u000aI therefore don't think it's entirely deserving of being considered the\u000a#2 greatest film of all time on IMDb.com.But moving on and looking past that, it is possibly one of my all-time\u000afavourite films for the feelings it leaves. Sure, it often jerks you\u000afor tears just a bit too purposely, but this is forgivable because\u000aemotion is crucial to a prison story. On top of that, it never falls\u000aprey to predictable sappiness - probably because of its content which\u000ais devoid of sentimental romance and instead fills you up with a tragic\u000afriendship. It is so well-sewn together by a feel-good narrative by\u000aMorgon Freeman that it is impossible not to enjoy this film.9/10\u000a

And in the end, I\u000aunderstand it and especially the result is out of my expectation that\u000adoesn't happened in the movies I have ever seen in the past. And also the performance skill is another thing I like it. They are\u000agood actors.

V\u000aYou'd certainly have to be over a certain age to watch this movie. Not\u000abecause it contains small amounts of very realistic and believable\u000aviolence (kids are used to that nowadays) but very much so because of\u000athe psychological impact it could have. Forget horror ... if I was a\u000akid and had seen this movie it would completely alter my perception of\u000ahumanity, given I would understand it. Once beyond that certain age\u000athis movie will impress you, to say the least.Shawshank Redemption places a man in the wrong place, at the wrong time\u000a(early 1900's) and in the worst kind of scenario. He's convicted of the\u000amurder of his wife and sentenced to life imprisonment. This is how the\u000amovie starts. From this point on the majority of the scenes will take\u000aplace in the Shawshank Prison Facility.Logicly, as a viewer, you side for the Andy Dufresne (beautifly\u000ainterpreted by Tim Robbins). It doesn't really matter whether you think\u000ahe did it or not ... he's stuck in there and it looks like he'll be\u000athere for a while. Friendships are born and enemies are made, as you\u000awould expect. The way this movie maintains a thrilling storyline\u000adescribing the friendships, however, is stunning. At the receiving end\u000aof one of those friendships is 'Red' Redding (Morgen Freeman), a fellow\u000ainmate. 'Red' can get you anything and as Andy, 'Red' is serving a life\u000asentence. Let's just say they have the time to get to know each other,\u000alearn from each other and eventually save each other.Because of the limited scenery the story and acting performance gets\u000aall the attention it deserves. If I had to condense this movie into a\u000afew words, "intelligence, justice, friendship, being human, redemption"\u000awould all sound like understatements. Saying anything more about this\u000amasterpiece would spoil your viewing experience. It's just one you'll\u000ahave to watch if you love movies.\u000a

V\u000a*******MINOR SPOILERS AHEAD**********The story begins with the court case of Andy dufresne for the alleged\u000amurder of his wife and her lover (the first few minutes at the start\u000acaptivate you from the beginning)Andy is wrongly convicted and sent to\u000aShawshank maximum security prison set with a double life sentence.Andy\u000afinds a new companion called Red(Morgan Freeman) the man who can get\u000athings for anyone in the prison for the right price. As a person that can get things or has been known to locate things from\u000atime to time for somebody Red doesn't find it particularly odd that\u000aandy asks him if he can get him Rita Hayworth in 1949.Of course he\u000aaccepts.The line that defines this great piece of cinema is "get busy living or\u000aget busy dying".This movie is without a doubt one of my favourites and\u000aremember always- FEAR CAN HOLD YOU PRISONER HOPE CAN SET YOU FREE!\u000a

V\u000aEven though this movie is over 10 years old, the message about\u000afriendship and not ever giving up will be relevant forever. The lessons\u000athat the main characters teach us in the face of adversity are\u000atimeless. This is also one movie that does not get old, and I have\u000awatched "Shawshank" many times. Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman were\u000aspectacular in their performances. They teach lessons that are\u000aextremely memorable and have quotes that you will never forget. The one\u000aquote in the film that is a stand-out is, "Get busy living, or get busy\u000adying". Who would not feel the impact of that quote? This is one movie\u000ayou have to have in your library, and I am not one that usually buys\u000aDVD's. This is a MUST SEE!!!! Don't miss this one, and also keep a box\u000aof tissues nearby.\u000a

V\u000aThe Shawshank Redemption as a film is the most powerful and moving\u000afilms I have seen and regard it as the best of all time yes there are\u000amany grate film out there many that are over looked by many people but\u000aas this film has shown box office ratings mean very little in the grand\u000astage time a film that ca be classed as a true classic is one like this\u000athats stands the test of time with grate acting and filming this one\u000amove people in ways other films can only hope to do. An it transcends\u000aall ages and class with a true hart felt tale of two men over coming\u000aadversity in a truly horrible place like the Shawshank prison in this\u000away it moves me to think how would i cope in that place if i could at\u000aall stand that kind of life for that long but it has a lighter side to\u000ait as Andy get one over the Worden and escapes the cells to freedom\u000a

V\u000aInspirational.Get busy living or get busy dieing.....From the richness of supporting actors to the lead roles this is the\u000amost complete drama film anyone would lucky enough to find on there own\u000alike i did on one evening in the video store. A Tour de Force from\u000aCastlerock, Frank Darabont, Tim, and Morgan Freeman.A path a passage call it what you will, this is what film for me is all\u000aabout, depth colour emotion and the strangest thing is...it just\u000adoesn't happen with guys?... Well i was spellbound and shocked at the ending, and then looked after\u000aby the director as they completed the film on the beach in Mexico.A truly wonderful film, worthy of not just the Oscar nominations but\u000athe all the Oscars themselves. To be taken on a the most wonderful of\u000acinematic journeys......This is what we all dream of.Frank Darabont, Morgan Freeman, Tim Robbins and Stephen King's Finest\u000aHour.Exceptional 10/10\u000a

V\u000aI rarely post comments on movies unless I, {A) Really love it, (B)\u000aReally hate it. This falls in the 'really love' category. The first\u000atime I watched this picture, I thought it was great, but much to dark\u000aand emotional, and contained unnecessary violence/sexuality. After\u000aviewing it 2 or 3 times, I finally understand why this movie is so\u000ahighly ranked by IMDb regulars, and I also have come to understand why\u000athe scenes of violence and brutality toward Andy Dufresne (Tim Robbins)\u000awere included in this film. I also understand why James Whitmore's\u000acharacter Brooks Hatlen behaved the way he did. It was all the\u000anastiness that happened to people we really like that makes the victory\u000acomplete at the end. 5 years ago I would have called The Shawshank\u000aRedemption an overrated, self-indulging unnecessarily dark picture\u000adeserving a rating of 5 or perhaps 6 at best. Now that the move is\u000anearly 12 years old, and now that I've watched it enough to finally\u000a"get it", I must agree with the masses and score this with a 9+. One of\u000athe best movies ever made and certainly the best of the Stephen King\u000aadaptations. How could I have been so obtuse?\u000a

V\u000aThis movie has to be one of the very best films i've seen in my\u000alifetime. I am usually not that fond of drama films but the portrayal\u000aof the characters and the amazing script made it a perfect translation\u000afrom the Stephen King book. Morgan Freeman gives one of his best\u000aperformances in this movie and actually makes you believe him as a jail\u000asmuggler, better than Chris Rock in the Longest Yard ever did. The\u000acinematography is brilliant showing the sheer scale of this old\u000adecaying prison. The movie may not have received any Academy Awards\u000a(the show was stolen by Forrest Gump that year) but it still remains to\u000abe one of the best films around. If your looking for a deeper movie\u000amore than you're typical action flick, this will provide what you were\u000alooking for. Go out and rent it, heck go and buy it because you'll want\u000ato watch it time and time again.\u000a

V\u000aThe Shawshank Redemption is the BEST movie of all time for many\u000areasons. The first reason being that Morgan Freeman did his best acting\u000ajob, and that is saying something. Freeman is the greatest actor of all\u000atime. Secondly, Tim Robbins gets so into his part you feel like the\u000astory is totally true and you are actually seeing it first hand. The\u000asupporting actors are wonderful as well. Enough about the acting which\u000awas second to none but the story was so compelling. The audience feels\u000asympathy for the main character and wishes for him to be redeemed, in\u000athe end its just a feel good story. I cannot express this enough, GO\u000aWATCH THE MOVIE NOW! It is awesome and will never be topped.\u000a

V\u000aI can watch this film a hundred times and still enjoy it. Morgan\u000aFreeman is one of my favorite actors. And this must be his best roll\u000aever. I thought Tim Robbins was definitely at his best in this film.\u000aAll the prison guards and inmates were really believable. The story\u000acaptures you from the beginning and doesn't let go until the final\u000acredits are rolled. This is the kind of film that make you think of how\u000amany inequities must exist in our prison system that no one ever hears\u000aabout. Of all the the movies of this type the Shawshank Redemtion\u000abrings to light how good and evil can exist in every situation. And\u000athat nothing is black and white. But until it effect you its out of\u000asight and out of mind.\u000a

V\u000aThis movie takes you through the life of some inmates of Shawshank\u000aprison. A very moving story.One of the best stories I've had the pleasure of seeing in a long time.Normally, I don't go out for these types of movies (sci-fi/classic\u000ahorror fan). This one really surprised me. I actually didn't see it in the theater, but caught it on TV, then\u000arented the movie. I've since bought it and have actually watched it a\u000afew times, which is rare for me to do. I usually watch a movie once,\u000athen not again for at least 6 months to a year.This movie will one day be a classic in my mind.Enjoy!\u000a

V\u000aThis film is, love it or hate it, flawless. I find myself unable to\u000apick out any one element of this movie that was poorly executed or\u000ainconsistent. The Director, Frank Darabont, despite his\u000amuch-less-than-impressive filmography successfully animates every scene\u000aand character in living detail. Whats more is the life and detail he\u000abrought to his screenplay.Originally published under Richard Bachman, Stephen King's\u000aonce-pseudonym, "Rita Hayworth and the Shawshank Redemption" is one of\u000athe most miserable short stories ever hacked out by any desperately\u000auninspired fiction author in history. The book makes no attempt to\u000abuild or define characters, background, or story progression. It\u000abasically apexes around the one scene in the prison theatre where the\u000awriter clumsily tries to convey the point of the book: as hopeless as a\u000aman's situation is, his dreams and fantasies live on. After King's\u000acatharsis he seemingly looses any real interest in his story and\u000aapathetically caps it off several pages later.Frank Darabont not only masterfully directed this film but deserves\u000amuch more credit for crafting 95% of this movie purely from his own\u000aimagination and being able to construct a very tangible plot line from\u000acomplete tripe. Credit where credit's due, Stephen King doesn't even\u000adeserve royalties.\u000a

V\u000aFor it's subtlety, it's intelligence, and it's gorgeous cinematography\u000a(often overlooked in this film), this is one of the finest films ever\u000amade. Robbins and Freeman are brilliant. The rest of the cast flows\u000athrough the storyline with a poise and cadence that is flawless. The\u000astory itself is based on a short work by Stephen King, but the\u000ascreenplay is sculpted perfectly and gently into a full-length film by\u000aFrank Darabont. A powerful story of one man's journey through a\u000apunishment he did not deserve, and "redemption" of soul that lifts the\u000ahearts of viewers. It reminds us that "hope is a good thing, maybe the\u000abest of things". Gentle and supremely smart.\u000a

V\u000aWhere to begin on how to comment on one of the most beautiful,\u000ahaunting, tragic yet slightly comical films in creation? This film is\u000aabsolutely groundbreaking and deserves its place amongst all the greats\u000aof Cinema History. Complete with an amazing cast, a wonderful\u000asoundtrack and a storyline that will leave you mesmerised for years\u000aafter your first viewing, this film is truly incredible.The film focuses on a man called Andy Dufresne, an intelligent banker\u000awho is accused of murdering his wife and her lover, and is\u000aconsequentially sentenced to two life sentences in Shawshank Prison.\u000aAndy soon befriends a man named Red, a man imprisoned for murder, and\u000aruns an underground syndicate to help his friends get a hold of things\u000afrom outside prison.Andy manages to help the guards of Shawshank Prison with their personal\u000afinancial problems using his knowledge as a Banker, and an unlikely\u000a'friendship' emerges, and soon Prison life doesn't seem so bleak for\u000aAndy. As Andy's journey through his life sentence grows, so does his\u000afriendship with Red, and he soon discovers what effects the walls of\u000aShawshank have on the people in the prison after a series of unexpected\u000aand tragic events.Andy's personality soon earns him new friends as he begins to change\u000apeople, fundamentally, without knowing how, as he spreads new lessons,\u000aboth comically and psychologically, and soon Andy turns into a much\u000amore intelligent man than we may have realised him to be at first.As time goes on, Andy resolves to make Shawshank Prison friendlier and\u000ahe works relentlessly to improve life for the prisoners and for the\u000aguards. But, as he continues to work hard for the good of others, he\u000abegins to learn the shocking truths of what the true colours of the\u000aguards and the Warden of Shawshank are. Revelations all come to the\u000afore when Andy discovers some information which may prove him to be the\u000ainnocent guy he has always claimed to be, and Andy's life takes a\u000aserious turn, and the consequences are dire for everybody as Andy's\u000adecisions become more and more unpredictable.Based on a short book by Stephen King, this film has hardly any faults\u000aat all, and is full of beauty, tragedy and comedy, and has a haunting\u000apresence as Morgan Freeman gives what is possibly the best performance\u000ahe has ever given, and Tim Robbins excels as the tormented Andy. But,\u000awhat makes this film go down in history isn't just the amazing script\u000aand the wonderful acting, but the film contains one of the most\u000abeautiful Soundtracks I have ever known, written by Thomas Newman. Many\u000aof the tunes are simplistic, yet very memorable, and they all perfectly\u000areflect the dilemmas and situations the characters of the film find\u000athemselves in.This film is not afraid to shock people with its subtle shifts in the\u000apersonalities of characters, and how a situation of comedy and hope may\u000asuddenly change to a tragedy beyond what you may have originally\u000aexpected. This film is a true classic. This is a work of art which is\u000aendlessly re-experiencable with painful pleasure.\u000a

V\u000aAfter watching this movie i was stunned at how great it was. It was the\u000afirst movie that kept me hooked the whole way through and had\u000aeverything in it. What made it better was seeing how it was expanded so\u000awell from the original short story, which again was very good. How\u000aanyone can say it less, must not have been watching it properly. There\u000ais nothing to say to criticise the movie, the acting was brilliant, the\u000acasting great, and the directing, breath taking. But we can not\u000aoverlook the great writer who brought this story to life, Steven King.\u000aWithout having writers like him, we would never have any movies to\u000amatch up to the likes of Shawshank and Godfather. I am still waiting\u000afor another movie to knock it off the top of my top 10 list, however, i\u000aam doubtful if this will ever happen.\u000a

V\u000aThis majestic movie is about Andy (Tim Robbins), a banker wrongly\u000aaccused of murdering his wife and her lover after discovering she had\u000abeen cheating on him. He gets impounded with two life sentences in the\u000aShawshank Prison. There he meets Red (Morgan Freeman) who befriends\u000ahim, and as the story moves along slowly, he eventually understands\u000awhat Andy once told him: "Get busy living, or get busy dying."Andy is persistent in his quest to be free. And he tries to convince\u000aRed during the entire course of the movie that hope is indeed a good\u000athing, even in a prison like Shawshank. In his endeavor, Andy will come\u000aface to face with the warden, who is truly a manifestation of greed\u000aitself. Many challenges will test his mettle.This piece of art is not to be missed; it is one of the greatest works\u000aof modern drama. And the slow pace of the movie only helps further to\u000asink you in its mood, and leave you satisfied with a strange bitter\u000asweet feeling in the end.\u000a

V\u000aI saw (once again) last night "Shawshank Redemption". If I have seen it\u000aonce, I have seen it fifty times and never does it ever get tiring to\u000ame. Stephen King wrote a story which becomes one of the great classic\u000amovies of all time. "Shawshank" is a story of a wronged man who overcomes the injustices of\u000alife, love and prison to remain the true person he always was. Andy,\u000aalthough a solitary and enigmatic person, finds himself through an\u000ainjustice which throws him into a quagmire of human refuse. In this\u000arefuse he finds a few pieces of humanity which lets him know there is\u000ahope. Red is one of those humans. Upon realizing that he is about to\u000afall into the hell of prison obscurity, Andy releases himself and\u000aescapes from the injustice of his current "human" existence. I use the\u000aword EXISTENCE for the whole movie is a work of existential survival. This is a movie that NO ONE should miss.\u000a

V\u000aThis movie surprised me so much I watched it twice in one day the first\u000atime I saw it. Sure I hadn't just picked a movie at random, at the\u000alocal DVD-shop, but I didn't expect it to be so good. After I watched\u000ait I had a look on the IMDb website and was surprised once again that i\u000afound it placed number 2 on the top 250 movies list. I wondered to\u000amyself, why didn't I know about this movie. Afterall Morgan Freeman and\u000aTim Robbins are quite well-known actors. Frank Darabont however only\u000ajust caught my attention in 1999, when 'the Green Mile' was released.\u000aFinally I came to the conclusion that it must have been either\u000atelevision, because it surely isn't on television often enough, or it\u000acould just be me, not knowing very much about the film-world before\u000a1995. For in fact, everyone in my school seemed to have known 'the\u000aShawshank Redemption' for a very long time. "One of the best movies\u000aever", my best friend said, "My favorite movie in the whole wide\u000aworld", another one of my friends. THEN WHY DIDN'T YOU TELL ME!!!! I\u000areplied. If you liked 'the Green Mile', I'm telling you now, you'll\u000alove this!!!\u000a

V\u000aI have been a fan of this movie for a long time.It seems that ever time\u000amy life hits a downward spiral, I can always seem to pop this movie in,\u000aand come up with a solution to my pending problem. It somehow gives Me\u000asense of peace and inner strength.So, It wasn't all that strange for me to pop it in when I was going\u000athrough a rough patch in my marriage. I found myself identifying with\u000amany of the characters in this movie.Many of them are trapped in a world of regret and mourning, due to a\u000amistake that had been made early on in their lives. This film gave me the strength to escape from my world of misery. And now I am able to say I, Like Andy broke out of my own personal\u000aShawshank.My Ex isn't too happy about the divorce. But life is much better now.\u000aAnd I feel saved from a life of unhappiness, Due to a mistake of a\u000amarriage to early in life.Thank You Frank Durabont.Your film saved my life.\u000a

V\u000aI think the shawshank redemption is the best film ever made. It is\u000aconsidered as a drama, but in my opinion this fantastic and\u000aentertaining movie has no genre. In my country (Argentina) not a lot of\u000apeople has seen it but i'm trying to change that situation by\u000arecommending it to everybody. Despite not having a great success while\u000ait was at the theaters, now with the VHS and the DVD, a lot of people\u000ais having a chance to enjoy 142 minutes of greatness and get away from\u000atheir boring lives at least for just a while. I find the twist that the\u000astory makes when Andy escapes from shawshank as simply perfect and\u000aunexpected. The only thing i consider that is wrong on the film is that\u000awhen the movie is over you want to see more and you can't see more\u000abecause the movie ended and ended perfectly, but i think that with a\u000amasterpiece like the shawshank redemption not even 10 hours of movie\u000awould be enough. Well i've got a lot more things to say but i don't\u000aknow really how to express myself. So if haven't seen it, what are you\u000awaiting for? just put your shoes on a go running to the video and i\u000aknow you'll enjoy it. I would like to know who is Allen Greene, i'll\u000aget very happy if you e mail me back telling me who he is. Simply the\u000abest movie ever made.\u000a

Thanks\u000ato Stephen King (short story Rita Hayworth and Shawshank Redemption)\u000aand Frank Darabont (screenplay) and all others who made that fantastic\u000afilm. I can not call it just a film.

V\u000aThe first time I saw "The Shawshank Redemption" I was only 12. At the\u000atime I was amazed at how a movie could present so much emotion. As I\u000ahave grown, my taste in movies has also. Still, I rank "Shawshank" as\u000amy favorite film, the one that I could watch every day for the rest of\u000amy life. If you have not seen this film, I pity you. Do not just rent\u000ait at your local Blockbuster. I implore you step away from your\u000acomputer, go out to the nearest store, and buy this movie. Not only do\u000aMorgan Freeman and Tim Robbins give performances that will make you\u000aquestion your humanity, but you will most definitely learn something\u000athat will benefit you as a person. So, if you are yet to see this film,\u000ayou must (in the words of Andy), "Get busy livin', or get busy dyin'."\u000a

V\u000a\u000a'94...the year the greatest movie to exist on this site was created...to\u000abad\u000ayou movie-goers disagree. Godfather Part I is a classic, but get real you\u000acan't defy this movie.  It may get slow at points but it overcomes that\u000awith\u000aamazing cleverness and a few tricks up the director's sleeve.

V\u000a\u000aThis movie is excellent in every way you look at it. Even the ways you\u000adon't\u000aknow about it is excellent.  Every time I think about this movie it makes\u000ame\u000awant to watch it again. Morgan Freeman and Tim Robbins give one heck of a\u000aperformance. A brilliant masterpiece to show how cruel the system was and\u000ahow they can take away your freedom with flimsy evidence. (It was back in\u000athe 30's, it's probably the best justice system they had).  And how cruel\u000athe prison system was back in the day. 2nd all time favorite move. (1st\u000abeing Platoon).\u000a

The acting was excellent (especially Tim Robbins), the storyline\u000awas\u000ainteresting...everything was great. As another reviewer mentioned, the\u000atime\u000aflies by when you're watching it. When the movie finished, I looked at\u000athe\u000aclock and was amazed that 3 hours had gone by. I'll certainly watch this\u000amovie again.\u000a

Redemption, now let me see, I don't think I know what that\u000ameans, to tell you the truth that's a politicians word. What do you really\u000awant to know, does redemption happen in this film, well yeah, I don't have\u000ait stuffed down my pants right now, sorry to say but I'll tell you.  I\u000asuggest you just get busy livin or get busy dyin before you find out how\u000asalvation lies within. I have to remind myself that some films aren't\u000ameant\u000ato be caged and kept to yourself, that there's something inside that they\u000acan't touch, i'm talking about hope. Those who know Shawshank best talk\u000aabout\u000ait often, but its that much more drab and empty now that its gone out of\u000atheaters.  It's not easy peasy japanesey any more, its more like skin\u000aburning and half blind from that delousin stuff they throw on you. It\u000alooked\u000aat first like a stiff would blow it over, but that was my first impression\u000aof the film. There's nothing left but all the time in the world to think\u000aabout why you haven't seen Shawshank yet.  From now on I'll write two\u000acomments a day about this film instead of one.  \u000a

The story\u000ais great, and written by my all time favourite writer - Stephen King\u000a(Misery, Dolores Claiborne, The Shining, Carrie and more), which are all\u000aamong my absolute top films.

V\u000a\u000aFrom the outside, the Shawshank State Prison looks like an English country\u000ahome, with turreted corners and a wide open surrounding lawn.   It's only\u000awhen you get inside and see the walls and meet the brutal guards that you\u000astart to realize that the state government simply wants you out of sight and\u000aout of mind.  And that if you die in Shawshank, the only reason that might\u000ainterest the government or the public is that it will save them money.The two main protagonists are Andy Durfresne (played by Tim Robbins) and\u000aEllis Boyd "Red" Redding (played by Morgan Freeman).  Andy is the new\u000aprisoner, a banker and investment expert convicted of killing his wife and\u000aher lover.  Red is the experienced con, who makes do on the inside by\u000asmuggling cigarettes, whiskey, tooth brushes, movie posters, etc. into the\u000aprison, and facilitating a market between the prisoners and between the\u000aprisoners and the guards.Two other important characters are prison Warden Norton (played by Bob\u000aGunton) and the Captain Hadley (wonderfully played by Clancy Brown). Andy,\u000aobviously, isn't your usual prisoner.  For one thing, he doesn't look very\u000atough, certainly not tough enough to have killed anyone. Red bets that Andy\u000awill be the first of the new draft of prisoners to "break" during their\u000afirst night locked in cells, by crying.  And "The Sisters," prisoners who\u000adelight in raping other prisoners, target Andy from day one.Well, both Red and "The Sisters" are wrong. Andy doesn't say a bad word\u000aabout his confinement or his cell.  And "The Sisters" have to beat the Hell\u000aout of Andy time after time to get any enjoyment out of him.  (Another\u000afeature of prison life which Andy doesn't complain about.)  What Andy does,\u000ais try to get on living. He has this hobby of rock carving, for which Red\u000acan supply the necessary tools and rocks.  He is also good at doing things\u000alike filling out tax forms and giving investment advice. This skill comes to\u000athe attention of the Warden and the guards, especially Hadley.  Soon,\u000aalthough not soon enough, Andy is given a trivial job in the prison library\u000aand protection from The Sisters in turn for providing investment advice to\u000athe guards and, for laundering all the money the Warden is making off the\u000afree labor he controls.Andy does other things to.  Over time he manages to turn the dark,  basement\u000alibrary at the prison into a real library where other convicts can simply\u000aread or, with ambition, try for their high school credentials.  In other\u000awords, Andy, although a convicted murder is good for the people around him,\u000aeven a bunch of convicts doing hard time.Is this the way prisons really operate? Can one person make the difference?\u000aWell, probably not. In fact I suspect Shawshank is shown to be a nicer place\u000ato live than any real state prison is, but the level of gross brutality\u000adisplayed in the movie by both the guards and by some of the prisoners was\u000aall I wanted to see and enough to convince me that I wouldn't want to live\u000athere. Also, this is a movie about redemption, a rare enough event in\u000aordinary life to motivate some "suspension of disbelief."There's the other side of redemption too, which is punishment of the truly\u000aguilty.  The Shawshank Redemption supplies both. And has fun doing so. In\u000afact, when I saw most of the movie by accident on TV, I - who never watches\u000aTV - found myself yelling at the kids to be quite so I could follow\u000aeverything that went on.  And then I went out the next day and rented the\u000avideo both to enjoy watching it again, and to help answer some left over\u000aquestions, like "who really did get redemption?"I strongly encourage you to see the movie to find out the answer to that,\u000aand several other questions. \u000a

V\u000a\u000aWow. I love this movie. To date I have probably watched it nearly 40\u000atimes... I am not obsessive, whenever it is on, I watch\u000ait.For most movies, at least the dramatic ones, I measure them based on how\u000athey make me feel. This one makes me feel sad when Brooks dies, angry when\u000aTommy dies, and happy when Red finds his friend. This movie makes me feel\u000agood. I know that is not very scientific, but it's the truth. Because of the\u000away it plays on me, I can't help but give it a 10. Here's\u000awhy:First off, the acting. Tim Robbins is SO subtle that he strikes me as a\u000aperson that tries to bury his innocence, because in reality it does not\u000amatter. Few would argue that Morgan Freeman is brilliant, as usual. But here\u000athe supporting cast throws in with equally impressive performances.The Score. Outside the music from the records appearing in the movie, the\u000arelatively unobstructive score just helps us confirm what our eyes see, the\u000awalls of Shawshank. We feel them, through the music, and break through them\u000aas Andy does.And last but not least, My compliments on the cinematography. The site is\u000aperfect for the movie, and the clever camera angles and lighting invite us\u000ainto the dreary prison world.\u000a

I'm a graduate student, and midterm week was approaching. I\u000aconstantly said to myself: Ok, I'll go to the library at the next commercial\u000abreak ... but without me knowing it my butt was glued to the seat after the\u000afirst 5 minutes... and by and by I forgot I was watching a film. Finally\u000awhen it was over I was left tearful and speechless. It was that powerful an\u000aexperience. I even feel that my life is enriched so much more after watching\u000athe film. Those 3 hours are worth every second of it, I can tell you that! \u000a\u000a

But That final monologue Tim Robbins gave about hope stuck with\u000ame to the end.\u000aRobbins and Freeman had great chemistry and I hope they will be in\u000amore movies together.

V\u000a\u000aShawshank describes one of the most honest truths of this world today--hope\u000ais the reason we keep on living.  The reason Red was able to overcome his\u000adesire to kill himself or anyone else (to break parole) was the hope of a\u000abetter life helping Andy.  I think that this main theme is best described in\u000aone of the end sayings---get busy living, or get busy dying.  Great\u000amovie! \u000a

V\u000a\u000aThe Shawshank Redemption is, without a doubt, the greatest film ever made.\u000aYou simply will never find a better film, ever.The story revolves around a smart, kind hearted vice president of a bank\u000anamed Andy Dufresne, played by Tim Robbins, who is absolutely brilliant in\u000athe starring role. Andy is sent to prison after murdering his wife and\u000alover. Claiming he is innocent of the crimes, and was the victim of an\u000aunfortunate coincidence, the law does not believe him, and sentences him to\u000alife in prison without possibility of parole. Once inside, he immediately\u000abefriends a criminal by the name of Red, played brilliantly by Morgan\u000aFreeman. Andy then becomes the victim of fear, despair, and the prison\u000aitself, which is inhabited by crooked officials and hardened criminals.\u000aAfter a while, Andy finds the hope inside of him to never give up, with the\u000ahelp of his friend Red and others. He starts doing tax returns for the\u000aprison guards and the warden, and after a while, the warden, played by Bob\u000aGunton, who makes the viewer loathe the word warden, has Andy doing his tax\u000afraud for him. It's safe to say that Andy is "friends" with the\u000aofficials.I don't want to give it away for those of you who haven't seen this picture,\u000abut believe me, you will be breathless. The hope Andy holds inside of him\u000agives all of us a warm feeling inside of us, and tells you to never give up.\u000aThe cast is perfect in every way, and the film just carries beautifully. You\u000awill find yourself praying for Andy through the whole film, through bad\u000atimes and even good times. It is wonderfully capped off with a surprise\u000atwist ending that will leave you shocked, stunned and emotionally\u000abreathless.I call this film my all time favorite, because I agreed with the characters,\u000afelt for them, hoped for them and in the case of the corrupt characters,\u000aloathed them, due to great acting. I was able to actually hate and detest\u000acertain characters, because that's how wonderful the acting is. I would\u000aactually have cried at this movie, if it weren't for me being so emotionally\u000aparalyzed by the cast and story.\u000a

V\u000aI don't write film reviews normally, but this is no normal film. i\u000anever tire of watching the Shawshank redemption not because of its\u000asheer brilliance but because of all the intertwining emotions portrayed\u000aby the characters.The film begins slowly but Andy Dufresene (Tim Robbins) has a strange,\u000aintriguing style unfamiliar with that of a normal inmate jailed for 2\u000alife sentences. As the film progresses it's almost like you know the\u000acharacters and you're part of the gang with Andy and Red. you feel\u000aandy's tenacity as he battles for whats right. As you begin to relate\u000ato Andy's feelings you are reminded why he is there: found guilty of\u000amurdering his wife and her lover. So when the 'new boy' clears his name\u000athere is a huge relief, almost like a maternal feeling of 'i knew it'\u000aAs the film builds towards the end you cannot know what is about to\u000ahappen and when it does.... wow; brilliant ending. brilliant film\u000a

V\u000aI finally watched The Shawshank Redemption and I agree that it is an\u000aexcellent film. The pacing, directing, and storyline, holds interest\u000athroughout, along with a superb supporting cast, and a very moving\u000aending.The main character is Andy played by Tim Robbins who is imprisoned for\u000athe murder of his wife. Later on in the movie, the evidence comes out\u000athat he is truly innocent. However The Shawshank Redemption sends a\u000apowerful message that it doesn't matter whether you are innocent or not\u000ainside Shawshank penitentiary. This is because the prison is run by a\u000asadistic and corrupt staff. In this facility, you must use all of the\u000aintellect you can, both book smarts, and street smarts to not only stay\u000aalive, but prevent yourself from going insane within the system.Andy befriends "Red," a fellow inmate, played by Morgan Freeman in\u000aanother great performance. He teaches Andy street smarts of survival\u000awithin Shawshank's hell-hole. Andy, an experienced banker with a master\u000aability for finance and book learning, manipulates the prison officials\u000ato get funds to set up a "basic skills" learning facility within the\u000aprison's library. Red helps him organize this, and HOW Andy sets up the\u000afunding is really an amazing part of the movie. Another inmate is the\u000ahead librarian, known as "Brooks," who delivers many amazing scenes in\u000athe movie.What is special about The Shawshank redemption is how the characters,\u000aespecially Andy and Red, are able to use their inner abilities to rise\u000aabove the conditions of the prison and the people who run it. There are\u000asome disturbing and violent images that show the harsh realities of\u000aprison life, such as fighting, and often getting beaten by the staff or\u000apunished for very small offenses and a lot of times for no reason at\u000aall. The Shawshank Redemption shows the abuse of power by prison\u000aauthorities and how the inmates have to have the courage to rise above\u000athis abuse, because they need to do this, in order to keep living. They\u000alearn that failure to get this courage and survival skills from other\u000ainmates will destroy them. A great quote in this film is. "you can get\u000abusy living, or you can get busy dying." Another interesting experience\u000ais how Red often wonders how at his advancing age he will be able to\u000asurvive outside the prison if and when the parole board lets him go. An\u000aunderlining message is that whether you "get busy living or dying" you\u000abecome so accustomed to life in a controlling environment that the\u000aoutside world, and the struggles, to reach it, to become physically and\u000amentally "free" are an enormous challenge requiring great perseverance\u000aand the ultimate in determination.As good as this movie is, I was looking for that spark of magic that\u000awould put it at and over the top of all time classic films. However, I\u000athink that there are some outstanding prison movies that are just as\u000agood if not better than The Shawshank Redemption. Watch the Sean Penn\u000aMovie, "Bad Boys" for an outstanding portrayal inside and outside a\u000ajuvenile prison. (Interestingly, Clancy Brown, who plays the bad\u000aofficer in "Shawshank," is just as good as a prison bully in "Bad\u000aBoys.") Another great movie is "Midnight Express" which is (although\u000aloosely) based on the real story of Billy Hayes who was arrested in\u000aTurkey for trying to smuggle hashish back to the USA in 1970. This is\u000aanother amazing survival prison picture with an unforgettable musical\u000ascore and some chilling moments.I see The Shawshank Redemption equal to, but no better than "Midnight\u000aExpress" or "Bad Boys." This is NOT a criticism of a fine movie! I am\u000aonly putting The Shawshank Redemption in strikingly similar prison\u000asurvival pictures that don't get the same credit that this movie does.\u000aCall this movie the greatest ever, and you have to do the same for\u000a"Midnight Express" or "Bad Boys." All three films have the same\u000aemotional impact. Another under rated movie that you should see is "An\u000aInnocent Man," which is also similar to The Shawshank Redemption but is\u000aconsidered only above average.The Shawshank Redemption is a great film for its time. But because of\u000asimilarities to other similar prison pictures, I can't classify it as\u000agreat for all time\u000a

V\u000aThis film is a truly awesome film once i had started watching the first\u000a10 minutes of it i was addicted to the TV and could do nothing but to\u000awatch it. This story is about a respectable banker (Andy Duframe) who\u000ais sentenced to Shawshank prison for life imprisonment for a crime he\u000adid not commit. Once he arrives at Shawshank he soon starts to learn\u000athat the prison mentally takes your life. However, Andy seems very\u000aunusual being very quite and polite around the prison. At the\u000aspectacular climax at the end of this film it just gives the viewer\u000asuch an amazing feeling of hope and in my opinion this is the best film\u000aevery made. A must watch film!!! 10/10\u000a

V\u000aThe Shawshank Redemption has you hooked from the very first scene.\u000aAlthough Andy's innocence was obvious from the beginning, you just\u000athink how he's going to get out of it.For me, the power and depth in this movie was it's ability to make\u000aprison life and friendships look better than that on the outside. Also\u000awhen they were finally released they were so hesitant to live on the\u000aoutside and wanted to go back in. I'm not sure why this affected me so\u000amuch but i think it's just the fact that one mistake forced these\u000apeople to live in a certain way where they don't want so much freedom\u000aand they're used to being workers with no rewards. They just couldn't\u000aadapt to the outside world. As if it were a different planet or\u000asomething.Although the men are supposed to be 'cold hearted killers', they seem\u000aso nice and are so easy to sympathise with. I know it sounds lame to\u000afeel sorry for a killer or thief but i think that the amazing story and\u000aacting, had me hoping that all of the prisoners were innocent... except\u000afor some obviously. Not to mention the guards were so mean and rude i\u000ajust wished they would all get punished and tortured at the end of the\u000amovie.If someone can feel that passionate and involved in a movie the first\u000atime they've seen it...i think it's a sign that if the person reading\u000athis still hasn't...they should. The Shawshank Redemption most\u000adefinitely deserves its spot on the IMDb top #250.\u000a

V\u000aOut of the fertile mind of American author Steven King, comes the\u000aincredible prison story called "The Shawshank Redemption." It is the\u000astory of a young banker named Andy Dufresne (Tim Robbins) who has been\u000afalsely convicted of murdering his wife and her lover. Sent to the\u000anotorious Shawshank, Dufresne, is subjected to the standard abuses\u000aevery prisoner faces. During the ensuing years however, he is further\u000asubjected to additional punishment by the "Sisters" who enjoy torturing\u000awhat they call 'fresh fish.' Still Andy tries to survive each day of\u000ahis sentence as best he can. Being extremely agile at his banking\u000acraft, he overhears Captain Byron T. Hadley (Clancy Brown) complain of\u000ahis personal financial problems. This single incident allows Andy to\u000atake advantage of his dire situation and become useful once again. Over\u000athe years, he becomes friends with fellow convict Ellis "Red" Redding\u000awho is adroitly played by veteran actor, Morgan Freeman. When warden\u000aSamuel Norton (Bob Gunton) learns of Dufresnes' financial ability, he\u000aimmediately takes advantage of it. This arrangement presents many\u000afinancial opportunities for the brutal warden and the meticulous and\u000apatience prisoner. Both can benefit from the outcome. The warden\u000aintends to retire richer and Hope is the only benefit Andy ascribes to.\u000aBe he has he has more talent than the warden suspects. With additional\u000acharacters actors like William Sadler as Heywood, Gil Bellows as Tommy,\u000aMark Rolston as Bogs and legendary James Whitmore who lends a superior\u000aperformance as Brooks Hatlen, this film is destined as a classic for\u000athe enjoyment of every audience. ****\u000a

V\u000aThis is the #1. Absolute must see film of the 1990s, Our Generation,\u000aanyone's lifetime and quite possibly the history of film. Hope and\u000aperseverance are front and center as themes in this blockbuster. Anyone\u000aof any age any race either sex and any religion should see this and I\u000apromise you'll wish to share it with everyone you know. Don't think\u000a"another Prison Movie" about-this one, it's above and beyond that\u000acliché. Expect career performances from Morgan Freeman, Tim Robbins,\u000aBob Gunton, and James Whitmore. Along side many outstanding character\u000aperformances from the supporting cast. I Cannot emphasize-the\u000aimportance of this film. I personally thank Everyone involved in\u000aproducing such an enormous telling of Steven Kings masterpiece. It has\u000abecome a source of daily inspiration for me and I continue to watch it\u000aSeveral times a year to this day. thank you.\u000a

V\u000aThis is a good movie, and surely is right up there among the finest\u000aprison/concentration camp depictions which almost ALWAYS have at least\u000acompetent quality. In my mind I compare this genre to\u000a"submarine"-films: confined space, lots of guys under constant threat,\u000atherefore drama and tension easily created without much sweat (ha ha).\u000aBut also with obvious problems in providing something new. The same\u000asituations and characters are presented just from here to eternity, and\u000aI rest my case with this movie in question as follows: despotic warden,\u000asadistic guard/s, evil fellow inmates who want to kill/rape you but\u000aalso few trusted friends (along with that one old timer and his\u000ainevitable sad ending) and finally escape by the main protagonist who\u000aof course has been convicted in the first place based on false\u000aaccusations or at least something not-so-bad crime.So what's so special here? 9.1/10, come on... Maybe the same tricks\u000aworked here as in that other Stephen King's hit-penitentiary-drama "The\u000aGreen Mile", i.e. manipulative scenes and quickly identified cardboard\u000acharacters. Or maybe the majority of movie-goers consider what they're\u000awatching at face value and never mind that "I've seen this all\u000abefore"-feel. Or maybe they haven't or just have a lousy memory? Yes I\u000aadmit, I'm something of a cynic. But I also believe I'm able to spot an\u000atruly honest effort when I see one. Probably that's the reason why I\u000aconsider the grandpa of them all, Mervyn LeRoy's 1932 "I'm A Fugitive\u000aFrom A Chain Gang" as the all-time best prison-flick. No film-snobbery\u000ahere, as I hope you'll agree when you see this true classic.\u000a

V\u000aThe Count of Monte Cristo isn't a very good book, and has spawned a few\u000apretty poor films, but it's the ideas which make it an enduring story.\u000aNow whether Stephen King was consciously inspired by Dumas's\u000a("Dumass's") book when writing the original short story I don't know -\u000awhat I do know is that Frank Darabont took a dour, typically\u000acoarsely-detailed potboiler and evolved it into something special. The\u000abig step for me, was that having taken an interesting idea and made it\u000agood, Darabont then found an ensemble cast and a cinematographer who\u000acould make it sing. I don't think there's a dull line of dialogue in\u000athe movie, and barely a camera shot either out of place or wasted. Why\u000ait is that equally talented filmmakers can spend millions and produce\u000athe kind of mindless gibberish which actually wins Oscars (like\u000a'Braveheart' did in the year 'Shawshank Redemption' was nominated) I'll\u000atruly never fathom. Maybe there should be another way of formally\u000arecognising talent: wait ten years then take a vote - that way the\u000amindless and the popular will have time to find their level and what's\u000aleft is worth remembering.\u000a

V\u000aThis is the best movie robbed of acclaim. I don't care what anyone says\u000aabout Forest Gump. This movie is better in almost every category except\u000amusic and maybe tied for movie of the year.Tim Robbins acting is as good if not better than Hanks. I always have a\u000aproblem with the simpleton character getting acting nods, as with the\u000awhite trash and ghetto thug characters. I think most of us can all do\u000athe Gumpy Slow Hick voice ala Cleatus the Slacked Jawed Yokel\u000a(Simpsons).I can't quite remember how many Oscars Gump stole from this GEM of a\u000amovie, but this movie blows me away on almost every level. The quite\u000apassion the Robbins portrays is surpassed by no one except maybe the\u000aFreeman sidekick character.This movie was of course a short story made into a movie (S King i\u000athink) and because of what it delivers i truly believe it to be the\u000abest movie of 1994, and probably one of the top 3 movies of all time.\u000a

V\u000aIn all the days of film, of directors actors and writers dreaming of an\u000aanswer to - What is the perfect film?, what is the peak of human\u000aachievement in film?, the answer would simply lie within the shawshank\u000aredemption. I dearly hope Frank Darabont, Tim Robbins and Morgan\u000aFreeman plus all the others involved in the making of this masterpiece\u000aare remembered for generations for creating a film unique, like no\u000aother ever seen or likely to ever be matched. I through no coincidence,\u000afound out about this film from IMDb as I scrolled the top 250 films of\u000aall time. My favourite at that time, LOTR return of the king sat below\u000a2 films, The Godfather and of course The Shawshank Redemption. I\u000acouldn't understand, however seemingly naive that any film could equal\u000alet alone surpass peter Jackson's third instalment. I found this not\u000awith the Godfather, but Shawshank. As millions worldwide have been\u000aencouraged and excited even affected by the world of film, i had no\u000aidea when I travelled to my friends house to see it that this film was\u000apowerful enough to get inside of you and affect you on such a personal\u000alevel that you were left spellbound. This film is matched only by one\u000aother and that is a trilogy of The lord of the rings. Pre-lord of the\u000arings no other film comes or came within a mile of this unique film.The film itself captures your heart with the unjust incarceration of\u000aAndy dufrane and follows his life and the relationship he forms with\u000ared. It is as many others have found almost impossible to describe in\u000awords the way this film affects you, but what can be said without any\u000areasonable doubt is this is a film that produces such a strong message\u000aof hope and friendship you cannot help but feel overwhelmed. The films\u000astart immediately shows the harsh treatment of new inmate referred to\u000aas ''Fat ass'' and maintains frequently throughout the feature with\u000aClancy brown executing the role of Hadley with brutality and realism\u000athat is consistent.The duo of Tim Robbins and Morgan freeman is unsurpassed in film only\u000aequalled by Elijah wood and Sean Austin. The film evokes a relationship\u000abetween the two that goes deeper than friendship and creates the heart\u000aand backbone of the film. These performances are the greatest of their\u000acareers and are so because of moments such as the first with red\u000athrowing the baseball to and fro and with Andy interacting with him\u000acasually to the last where they are reunited. I could talk like many\u000aothers about heartwarming moments of the film such as brooks sad\u000apowerful ending or how clever the plot deceives you at the end and\u000areveals the magic of the film but i will conclude. This film uses no\u000aspecial effects, no predictability, no shoddy acting but perfection.\u000aYou cannot help but gain what the heart of the film is based on which\u000ais Hope.I can truly say this film has helped me through at 1 bad time\u000ain my life, and i know that it will help me through many more. I can\u000asay from my perception, that it will always hold a place in my\u000acollection and for one single feature film this is the best film ever\u000amade. I truly wish that the theme is never lost, HOPE.\u000a

I have seen it over 100\u000atimes since I first 'experienced' it, and now it is impossible for me\u000ato watch any scene without getting chills down my spine. Frank Darabont\u000ashould have a day made in his name for his adaptation of Stephen King's\u000acompelling and brilliant story. No one could have surmised that\u000aallowing for one of the more likable inmates to be killed would make\u000athe movie even MORE powerful...but he did. One last thing...I just\u000awanted to thank God for allowing them to change the ending to that of a\u000adiminishing Robbins and Freeman at the end, no words needed.\u000a

V\u000aDefinitely NOT your ordinary Stephan King adaptation. 'The Shawshank\u000aRedemption' is one of the few movies I've seen, where emotion and story\u000aare perfectly blended into one absolutely AMAZING story! You can feel the terror from Andy's trial, you can feel the happiness\u000afrom the beer on the roof scene,the anger from scenes involving The\u000aSisters, the shock when he learns that Tommy was killed, and the hope,\u000ajoy and happiness gathered together when Andy escapes.The acting was amazing, the adaptations from the book were spot-on,\u000athis is the greatest adaptation I have ever seen. Of all the people in\u000athe world, I have never met one person who didn't enjoy it.If you haven't seen it; why are you sitting there? Go out and rent it\u000aand see for yourself, how amazing this film is!\u000a

V\u000aWhen i first watched it i like it at once,it is really a good film.i\u000acan learn a lot of things from it.¡°The Shawshank Redemption", which is a movie about time, patience and\u000aloyalty - not sexy qualities, perhaps, but they grow on you during the\u000asubterranean progress of this story, which is about how two men serving\u000alife sentences in prison become friends and find a way to fight off\u000adespair.The story is narrated by "Red" Redding (Morgan Freeman), who has been\u000ainside the walls of Shawshank Prison for a very long time and is its\u000aleading entrepreneur. He can get you whatever you need: cigarettes,\u000acandy, even a little rock pick like an amateur geologist might use. One\u000aday he and his fellow inmates watch the latest busload of prisoners\u000aunload, and they make bets on who will cry during their first night in\u000aprison, and who will not. Red bets on a tall, lanky guy named Andy\u000aDufresne (Tim Robbins), who looks like a babe in the woods. But Andy does not cry, and Red loses the cigarettes he wagered. Andy\u000aturns out to be a surprise to everyone in Shawshank, because within him\u000ais such a powerful reservoir of determination and strength that nothing\u000aseems to break him. Andy was a banker on the outside, and he's in for\u000amurder. He's apparently innocent, and there are all sorts of details\u000ainvolving his case, but after a while they take on a kind of unreality;\u000aall that counts inside prison is its own society - who is strong, who\u000ais not - and the measured passage of time. Red is also a lifer. From time to time, measuring the decades, he goes\u000aup in front of the parole board, and they measure the length of his\u000aterm (20 years, 30 years) and ask him if he thinks he has been\u000arehabilitated. Oh, most surely, yes, he replies; but the fire goes out\u000aof his assurances as the years march past, and there is the sense that\u000ahe has been institutionalized - that, like another old lifer who kills\u000ahimself after being paroled, he can no longer really envision life on\u000athe outside. Red's narration of the story allows him to speak for all of the\u000aprisoners, who sense a fortitude and integrity in Andy that survives\u000athe years. Andy will not kiss butt. He will not back down. But he is\u000anot violent, just formidably sure of himself. For the warden (Bob\u000aGunton), he is both a challenge and a resource; Andy knows all about\u000abookkeeping and tax preparation, and before long he's been moved out of\u000ahis prison job in the library and assigned to the warden's office,\u000awhere he sits behind an adding machine and keeps tabs on the warden's\u000aill-gotten gains. His fame spreads, and eventually he's doing the taxes\u000aand pension plans for most of the officials of the local prison system. There are key moments in the film, as when Andy uses his clout to get\u000asome cold beers for his friends who are working on a roofing job. Or\u000awhen he befriends the old prison librarian (James Whitmore). Or when he\u000aoversteps his boundaries and is thrown into solitary confinement. What\u000aquietly amazes everyone in the prison - and us, too - is the way he\u000aaccepts the good and the bad as all part of some larger pattern than\u000aonly he can fully see.The partnership between the characters played by Tim Robbins and Morgan\u000aFreeman is crucial to the way the story unfolds. This is not a "prison\u000adrama" in any conventional sense of the word. It is not about violence,\u000ariots or melodrama. The word "redemption" is in the title for a reason.\u000aThe movie is based on a story, Rita Hayworth and the Shawshank\u000aRedemption, by Stephen King, which is quite unlike most of King's work.\u000aThe horror here is not of the supernatural kind, but of the sort that\u000aflows from the realization than 10, 20, 30 years of a man's life have\u000aunreeled in the same unchanging daily prison routine. The director, Frank Darabont, paints the prison in drab grays and\u000ashadows, so that when key events do occur, they seem to have a life of\u000atheir own. Andy, as played by Robbins, keeps his thoughts to himself. Red, as\u000aFreeman plays him, is therefore a crucial element in the story: His\u000aclose observation of this man, down through the years, provides the way\u000awe monitor changes and track the measure of his influence on those\u000aaround him. And all the time there is something else happening, hidden\u000aand secret, which is revealed only at the end. "The Shawshank Redemption" is not a depressing story, although I may\u000ahave made it sound that way. There is a lot of life and humor in it,\u000aand warmth in the friendship that builds up between Andy and Red. There\u000ais even excitement and suspense, although not when we expect it. But\u000amostly the film is an allegory about holding onto a sense of personal\u000aworth, despite everything. If the film is perhaps a little slow in its\u000amiddle passages, maybe that is part of the idea, too, to give us a\u000asense of the leaden passage of time, before the glory of the final\u000aredemption.All in all, I think it is a very good film and worthy for everybody to\u000awatch, the most important sentences ¡°Hope is a good thing , maybe the\u000abest of things, No good thing ever dies.¡± It is really make us\u000athinking deeply, and another one which was said by Red, he said that\u000athere has one kind of birds that you could never keep him in the cage,\u000abecause every feather of his body was covered by the brilliance of\u000afreedom. I think everyone should remember this , everyone of us are\u000acovered by some brilliance of our own, we should never give up no\u000amatter how difficult it is! And we should remember that ¡°hope is a\u000agood thing¡± ,we should have hopes for all our lives!--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\u000a

V\u000a\u000aI have long viewed the Shawshank Redemption as the most underrated film of\u000aall time.  That isn't to say that it wasn't universally acknowledged by the\u000amovie-going public as a great movie, but in terms of awards, critical\u000aacclaim, and best ever lists, this has somehow kept on losing out.  Now that\u000aI see it has the number two position, as voted by the movie-going public, on\u000aprobably the most accurate best ever list in the world (AFI be damned), I am\u000aeminently pleased.  There is no way Forrest Gump should have won best\u000apicture over Shawshank.  Certainly, Forrest Gump is a charming, well-acted\u000afilm, but it is nothing compared to this.  Morgan Freeman excels, and Tim\u000aRobbins turns in his best performance.  If you haven't seen this\u000amasterpiece, get up and rent it immediately.\u000a

V\u000a\u000aThis movie is good, there's no question about that, but he 2nd best ever?\u000aThat's a bit of a stretch. I can't really imagine that all of those people\u000awho gave this movie the 9 and 10 votes have seen very many other good\u000amovies.  Sure, the story is meaningful and it's harsh etc, but there are\u000aso\u000amany movies that are moving and powerful.  The fact that Shawshank is #2\u000aon\u000athis list is a reflection of those voting. \u000a

V\u000a\u000aIt was a great and a pleasant surprise to see that the movie that I chose\u000aalmost five years ago as my favorite movie of all time is the number one\u000aon\u000athe list. Although it's my favorite, my choice was based mostly on my\u000apersonal reaction toward this movie and I did not expect that there are so\u000amany people that feel the same way I do about it. I love every single\u000athing\u000aabout this movie, every single shot. And believe me I know what I'm\u000atalking\u000aabout because it's the only movie that I've seen so many times and it\u000anever\u000afailed to amaze me.A great story based on Steven King's novella, great\u000adirection by Frank Darabont, and great acting by Tim Robbin and Morgan\u000aFreeman. Not to mention music, and the truly original and always inventive\u000adialogue. Every body who commented here on this movie probably mentioned\u000aall\u000athe obvious great things about it. I would like to add one thing that made\u000athis movie even more spectacular to me. The movie contains scenes that\u000apresent a complete idea that stand and work on its own. Like the scene\u000awhen\u000aAndy plays Mozart or the scene on the roof. Critics might choose others,\u000abut\u000athere's no other movie touched my soul like this one, and I've seen\u000athousands of them. Remember "Hope is a good thing, maybe the best of\u000athings,\u000aand no good thing ever dies".  \u000a

V\u000a\u000aIn the first thirty minutes of watching this show on a slow Saturday\u000aafternoon I knew it was my favorite.  I was captured instantly by how the\u000astory unfolded.  You can't help but deeply respect Andy Dufrain (I don't\u000aknow if thats spelled correctly).  The way he speaks with thought and\u000ahope,\u000athe way he walks about the jail collecting rocks.  Seemingly oblivious to\u000athe fact that he is imprisoned in a jail.  They couldn't have found a\u000aperson\u000athat suited the roll of Red better than Morgan Freeman.  His voice is\u000aperfect for the narration of the film.  Every card played by this movie\u000awas\u000aan ace.  From the way they filmed the tall, barren walls of the prison to\u000athe brilliant story( thanks to Stephen King for that), and let's not\u000aforget\u000athe music.  I am pleased to see that it's in the top spot of this site, I\u000athink it deserves it.\u000a

V\u000a\u000aIn this era of television, and cable television, and satellite television,\u000awe are bombarded with movies, old movies, new movies, PPV movies, made for\u000aTV movies. There are so many outlets these days, that its unlikely that\u000ayou'll watch any movie on TV today, and not have another opportunity to\u000awatch the same film, in its entirety within a week.Amidst this morass of celluloid, and electronic representations thereof,\u000athere are films, which never leave you. You may be absentmindedly changing\u000athe channel on a Saturday afternoon, or late on a Friday night when you\u000acome\u000aacross one, a scene, any scene, will play. Whether it be from the\u000abeginning,\u000amiddle, or end, it hardly matters-- it is immediately recognizable to you.\u000aYour mouth will begin to make the words the actors are to say,\u000aunconsciously. A smile may come to your face as does a friendly, warm\u000afeeling inside, you may feel a tear, or fear the tear to\u000acome.You will move aside the bedclothes you were changing in order to find a\u000aspot\u000ato sit on the end of the bed, you will adjust the volume to your taste.\u000aYou\u000awill not go for a drink, or a snack, but remain, transfixed.Such is the magic of movies, and there are many movies for many people,\u000abut\u000a'The Shawshank Redemption' is one for us all. It is the sweetest music,\u000aand\u000aour conductor, Frank Darabont is indeed a maestro.The wonderful story behind the making of the film starts with  the\u000agenerosity of  Stephen King. King of course gets a premium price any time\u000aone of his novels is adapted. He has chosen to give young, unproven\u000afilmmakers an opportunity to adapt any of his short stories (as opposed to\u000athe novels) for the bargain basement price of $1. There is only one\u000acaveat,\u000athat they send him a video tape of their finished film. This opportunity,\u000aFrank Darabont took to advantage and made a short film, based on a King\u000astory, "TheWoman in the Room".  And King was impressed. When years later\u000aFrank Darabont came back to King hoping to adapt something called  'Rita\u000aHayworth and the Shawshank Redemption', King was only too happy to\u000aaccede.What came from Mr. Darabont is true cinematic history. Thank you sir,\u000athank\u000ayou both.\u000a

V\u000a\u000aOk, as I give this movie a 9, it is going to be hard to be critical, but I\u000afeel as though that is the responsibility of anyone who doesn't rate a movie\u000aa 10.First of all, the acting was sensational - as good as I have seen in a long\u000atime. The direction was great and the script was great. And, it turned into\u000a(unexpectedly) a true buddy story.I could only criticize a couple things - one of which was NOT the length -\u000a2:20. I found it a little troubling that most of the criminals were\u000aextremely nice guys - except for the obligatory bad guys in the shower. I\u000aalso have to confess a real distaste for the homosexual overtones -\u000aespecially early on. But, then what prison movie attempting to depict real\u000alife could leave that out???Also, prison movies in the 1940's, 1950's and 1960's are not my favorite\u000agenre, however one of the advantages of prison movies are that you really\u000adon't care very much what period it takes place in. Anyway, that is just\u000apersonal preference.All in all, it deserves the praise it gets. I'm very glad I finally took the\u000atime to watch it.  \u000a

There are so many\u000agood things about it that it is hard to even come close to mentioning all of\u000athem, so I'll only mention the one thing I liked the most.  I liked the fact\u000athat the movie could have ended a couple different times, and it still would\u000ahave been one of the best, but for Shawshank that just wasn't good enough.\u000aIt kept going until you felt the ending was so perfect, that you truly had\u000ato sit back breathless.

V\u000a\u000aThe great Morgan Freeman continues to spin out superlative performances.\u000aThis is one of his finest, a difficult and complex portrayal of a veteran\u000aconvict, who is so long a part of the numbing prison culture that we're\u000asomewhat surprised by his sympathetic understanding of the unfortunate Andy\u000aDuFresne, movingly interpreted by Tim Robbins. People are in prison, for the\u000amost part, because they belong there. Prisoners don't normally exude\u000acompassion for their fellow unfortunates, but Freeman's "Red" noticed right\u000aaway that DuFresne was of different stuff. Their friendship cut across both\u000aracial and social lines, and that it was forged in the furnace of a prison\u000aconducted by so corrupt a warden as Norton, was a magnificent testimony to\u000atheir bond. Clancy Brown as the warden's personal storm trooper could have\u000abeen reduced to caricature, but he turned this difficult role into a\u000amemorable portrayal of mindless violence. The great revelation in this film\u000awas Bob Gunton as the warden. There has rarely been, if ever in film, a\u000akeener reading of a character given the charge of men who've been reviled by\u000asociety, and thus forgotten and who are totally dependent upon his good will\u000afor their very survival. Norton was the essential bureaucrat who, given\u000asufficient backing from an indifferent public, can build from the\u000afoundations up, a system which brutalizes and murders men, and which\u000aexploits the last vestiges of their self-respect for his personal ends. The\u000anarration by Freeman in his great baritone lent an authentic base line for\u000athe kaleidoscopic unfolding of the film. James Whitmore's poignant turn as a\u000aman doomed to death outside of prison is proof of what lengthy incarceration\u000ato do to a man, turning him into a slave who is addicted to the very\u000astructure which denies his humanity. That both DuFrense and "Red" each\u000amanaged to leap over the abysses which yawned before them, was the great\u000acathartic experience of the film.\u000a

V\u000aShawshank Redemption (1994)The short of it: I asked some students what their favorite movie was,\u000aand some of them (many of them) said, "Shawshank Redemption," and I\u000asaid, "I haven't even seen it." And they assigned it to me as homework.\u000aI started watching, and after about twenty minutes I realized I had, in\u000afact, seen it before.That's how memorable it was for me.I also see that Shawshank has the highest user rating of any film on\u000aIMDb. What do these other intelligent, movieloving people see that I\u000adon't? I wish I could know, but I can't except by reading their\u000acomments. And here, then, finally, is mine.First of all, I don't think it's a terrible film, despite all the\u000apicking I do. I'm trying to be analytical. But when I take one aspect\u000aand think about it independently, and compare it to other movies I\u000alike, it starts to look weak for specific reasons, which is good to\u000aknow. Please don't read further if you just want a confirmation of why\u000athis is a great film. In brief, I don't think Shawshank probes,\u000ainvents, or seduces aesthetically. It's just a nice story well told.First, that story. Stephen King is a successful writer, to say the\u000aleast, and a really good "wordsmith." His stories work with simple\u000aconflicts, and they are plot driven--one thing happens, another thing\u000ahappens, a third thing is almost necessary to have happen, a twist, a\u000aturn, and always, from what I can tell, a nice wrap up. That's pretty\u000amuch the plot in Shawshank. There is almost no depth to the\u000acharacters--they are stereotypes, not made of foamcore maybe, but\u000aflimsy. There is the evil warden, of course. There is the thoughtful\u000ablack man who everyone likes, played by Morgan Freeman (who narrates),\u000aand the thoughtful white man who doesn't like anyone (at first), played\u000aby Tim Robbins.Of course, it goes from there, but really, the "twists" are old ones. The plot is the framework for something I found more irritating, and\u000athat was a slightly glib tone. The story was not really "realistic" in\u000aany sense, though the trappings of actual prison life are all there,\u000afrom rape in the back room to corruption in the front office. Maybe as\u000aa "fable" it can get away with its airiness, right up to the final\u000ahappy ending. It might not need any grounding in reality. As a fable it\u000awould naturally avoid complexity, or even anything independently\u000ainteresting. What I mean is, maybe the journey through these familiar\u000aclichés, done with a fuzzy, congenial ease, is self-satisfying on\u000apurpose. And therefore Shawshank Redemption is heartwarming and\u000aenjoyable, to use two words that are as exciting together as milk and\u000awarm.But it was this breezy tone that made it unwatchable for me. I had to\u000afastforward through a few parts in the second half (it was my second\u000atime seeing it). It seemed that nothing happening! Nothing I hadn't\u000aseen before in other movies. It struck me not as mythic or spiritual\u000a(those are words people use) but as false, as anti-meaningful because\u000ait's obvious, familiar, comforting.The film-making? Let's tick off some basics. Editing: conventional, and downright slow. You can argue the pace was\u000aleisurely and luxurious to draw the viewer in. Or you can say it's\u000adrawn out and sluggish.Music: functional and familiar, "movie music" pure and simple, in its\u000alush seduction, which is offputting once you pay attention to it\u000adirectly.Script: hmmmm. The writing is not distracting or "bad" especially, but\u000athat's hardly a recommendation. It gets the information across. But\u000areally, read some lines, repeat a few scenes out loud. There are those\u000anow famous lines, about everyone being innocent and so on, but most of\u000athe movie doesn't crackle--even other Hollywood heartwarmers like Die\u000aHard have more inventiveness. Isn't Shawshank presenting Hallmark\u000asentiments?Acting: exactly what the film needed for its pace and intentions. No\u000afaulting Freeman or Robbins there.Photography: professional. If there was a movie crying out for some\u000agreat filming, this is one, with a great interior to exploit and some\u000agood night scenes. But the camera work is functional, with a few\u000amoments of higher drama (the prisoner getting shot from above, the\u000aescape sequence). But look how often the scenes are just filmed\u000a"nicely" so that we enjoy being there. Maybe this is the idea, to be\u000acaressed and not assaulted--it's not an action adventure film, so I\u000adon't expect to be shocked. Direction: finally, the lynchpin person here needs to be accountable.\u000aOh, I'm sure Frank Darabont doesn't mind the cult status of his movie,\u000abut he probably knows he is no auteur, but rather rode the coattails of\u000aa lot of talented craftspeople around him. But those other people all\u000ahad to count on him to ask for (and deliver) something with more\u000aoriginality, beauty, surprise, depth, and compactness than the\u000aShawshank we have. It's not a shame, obviously, that we have what we\u000ahave, because so many people love it, really really love it. I didn't\u000acare for his other well known film either, The Green Mile, and so\u000aagain, it's just what you want from your two hours of absorption.But it brings me back to where I started, which is to realize that\u000athere are all kinds of viewers, and movies to match. This one didn't go\u000athe places I need a great movie to go. It's not a bad movie, not at\u000aall. In fact, this might be a classic example of a movie being much\u000amore than the sum of its parts. But, still, even the whole strikes me\u000aas flip and easy-breezy, obvious as child's lie. It is content to be\u000asuperficial, and I, personally, am not.\u000a

V\u000aThe Shawshank Redemption is one of those films that people either love\u000aor  well, hate is probably the wrong word.It's an OK film, but lacks in so many areas, most of all script and\u000aideas. Yet again, we are subjected to an innocent man being sent to\u000aprison, governed by a sadistic guard and corrupt governor. Yet again,\u000awe see him get a glimmer of hope of release, and yet again we see hope\u000adestroyed.It's not exactly original.But, it is well filmed, and superbly acted. Tim Robbins and Morgan\u000aFreeman played the lead roles to perfection. The surrounding parts were\u000aplayed as equally well, and none let the film down. Pity about the\u000ascript.Don't get me started about the poster on the wall. All the searches,\u000aand no-one took it down? Oh, come on.Watch the film  yes, even enjoy it.

V\u000aIt's times like these that almost tempt me to grab Jigsaw off the\u000ashelf. It's been almost a month since I saw a film that was flatout\u000abad; the worst review I've given in weeks was a 6/10 to Flightplan.\u000aThis film obviously didn't break my streak.I went into it knowing next to nothing, only that IMDb has it ranked as\u000athe second best movie of all time, that it was based on a story by\u000aStephen King, and that it took place in a prison. Needless to say, it\u000ablew me away. I wont say a thing about the plot, just so that others\u000awho've yet to see this film have a chance at the same experience as me.\u000aI will say this though: It has some of the most subtle and unexpected\u000atwists you will ever see. One in particular stands out above the rest.Not much can be said about the actors that hasn't been said. Morgan\u000aFreeman gives one of the best performances of his career, and even\u000athough I've only seen 2 or 3 other Tim Robbins movies, I'm sure the\u000asame can be said for him.Though I don't agree with the multitudes of people that call this the\u000abest movie ever made, it was still a very good, very well made, very\u000aentertaining and almost heartbreaking film.9/10\u000a

V\u000aAfter watching the shawshank redemption it left me with a true feeling\u000aof hope. The whole film symbolises the idea that hope can get through\u000aany challenge. I heard of this movie in the same way many other people\u000adid, through a recommendation from a friend describing it as the best\u000amovie he had ever seen. Even though I watched it with high expectations\u000aI was not at all disappointed. If I could recommend anything from this\u000acomment it would be to watch this movie. Its #2 in the top 250 for a\u000areason! The story the film revolves around and the relationship between\u000aRed and Andy is truly amazing to watch but also is the way that each\u000atime I watch the film I uncover new depth to it and new angles from\u000awhich to view the movie. There are many hidden references and ideas\u000athat can be taken from the Shawshank redemption making it a movie that\u000aworks on many levels (this being a rarity for most modern\u000ablockbusters).\u000a

V\u000a\u000aOkay, let's say this from the word go...Shawshank Redmeption might as well\u000abe called Fantasy Island visits Alcatraz.  Lets just see how many shopworn\u000aprison movie cliches the picture has:1.)  A corrupt warden\u000a2.)  Brutal guards\u000a3.)  Homosexual gang attacks (at least not in a shower)\u000a4.)  Innocent man sent to jail has a journey of self discovery\u000a5.)  All illiterate convicts speak flawless english and spout witty\u000aphrases.\u000a6.)  No racial tension, in fact no blacks with any character except Morgan\u000aFreeman doing a version of the kindly butler from a Shirley Temple\u000apicture...after all, it appears all he is there for is to be the witty\u000asidekick and supply cigarettes and pictures of scantily clad\u000awomen.\u000a7.)  A black man runs the illegal smuggling into the prison\u000a8.)  Nobody in jail is bad, or even seems like they could be violent, they\u000aare all a bunch of happy go lucky working class stiffs.  I guess this\u000ameans\u000awe should be able to identify with rapists and murderers as they are just\u000alike us...a chilling thought.\u000a9.)  Nobody except the hero ever attempts an escape or seems to want to\u000aescape,\u000a10.) Over use of metaphors such as rain as a metaphor of washing himself\u000aclean of his past and putting on a new life.I am not saying that all prison films have to be a version of Scared\u000aStraight, but come on, this is clearly a fantasy prison and the very\u000aunreality of it undercuts anything the movie might be trying to say.  The\u000aShawshank Redemption is in this reviewers eye nothing more than another\u000aholier than thou morality play packaged as "gritty realism" all because it\u000ais based in a prison...ho-hum.\u000a\u000a

V\u000a\u000aThe redeeming feature of this film is that it was made in innocence. \u000aDarabont had no idea he was making anything profound.  And he wasn't.  This\u000ais a film about a prisoner who ... well, I can't give away the plot, for\u000ait's much better to come to the screen in ignorance; but anyone who thinks\u000athat this is a story about how Andy `finds out the truth about himself', or\u000ais in any way `redeemed', is grasping at straws.  These elements play so\u000alittle role in the overall structure that we might as well ignore\u000athem.I have a theory: so many people have told Darabont that `The Shawshank\u000aRedemption' was a profound life-changing experience that he believed them,\u000aand then SET OUT to make another `profound, life changing experience' with\u000a`The Green Mile', with predictably ghastly results.  I haven't seen `The\u000aGreen Mile' yet, so I can't be sure.Don't get me wrong.  A great movie needn't be profound, and the film which I\u000athink is the best ever made isn't profound, either - it contains no comment\u000aat all on the Nature of Human Existence or anything of that kind.  Still,\u000a`The Shawshank Redemption' isn't even great.  It's a very good story very\u000awell told.  Lucky we get such nice photography, rather than having to put up\u000awith Stephen King's prose every step of the way ...  Also, Tim Robbins has\u000athe lead role.  (Lucky, again, that it wasn't Tom Hanks - now THERE'S a\u000afrightening thought.)  Nobody can do the bewildered but intelligent innocent\u000aso well as he can.  Fans make such extravagant claims about this movie, but\u000aI don't think it makes such extravagant claims about itself, which is why it\u000aworks so well.\u000a

V\u000a\u000aBy far Shawshank was the best film of 1994. But look who it was up against\u000aat the Oscars...Forrest Gump. It's not that Forrest Gump was such a horrible\u000amovie as alot of people make it out to be, in fact it was good. But it was\u000aalso a very hyped movie. The public ate it up, and they also got too much of\u000ait. That might be the reason everybody on the internet seems to hate it so.\u000aBut to say Forrest Gump is better than the Shawshank Redemtion is a far cry.\u000aI wish the Oscar's didn't do this all the time. They vote on who they think\u000athe public wants to win it seems like sometimes. It was robbed. But that\u000adoesn't make it any less of a film. It's a triumph of filmmaking. Robbins\u000aand Freeman are excellent. The character Brooks is terrific, and the warden\u000ais protrayed perfectly by Bob Gunton. Go rent this movie, if it's the last\u000athing you do. The ending is one of the most satisfying in movie\u000ahistory.\u000a\u000a

V\u000a\u000aI was a little surprised at first to see this film ranked #1 out of all\u000apossible candidates in the IMDB user ratings. When I thought about it,\u000athough, it made more sense--this is a "Rocky"-type feel-good movie that\u000adoesn't really make you think and reinforces what we would all like to\u000abelieve about human nature. Don't get me wrong--it's a fine film (I gave it\u000aa solid 7 out of 10), it's just not, in my view, up there with _Casablanca_\u000aand _The Graduate_.I guess the main problem I have with _Shawshank_ is the nature of the script\u000aand characters. Think about it: is there a single person in the film who\u000aisn't a one-dimensional cardboard cut-out with very simple motivations, or a\u000aHollywood cliche or stereotype? We have (in no particular order), a corrupt,\u000abigoted prison warden (who is a religious hypocrite for good measure), a\u000abrutal prison guard, a man who is wrongly accused of murder, an old convict\u000awho knows all the ropes and can't live on the outside, and a convict who is\u000amurdered by the brutal guards. Now where have we seen this stuff before?\u000aOnly in a few dozen movies made from the 20s to the 90s. There's really\u000anothing new here. Probably this comes from the fact that the story is from\u000aStephen King, who doesn't really do well with complex characters (a problem\u000aI noted as far back as _Carrie_).If you want to see a good prison picture, try _Cool Hand Luke_ (from which\u000athis movie borrows considerably). If you want an escape picture, see either\u000a_The Great Escape_ or _Papillon_, both with Steve McQueen. Or if, by some\u000achance, you want a crime and punishment movie that really makes you think,\u000ago with the late great Stanley Kubrick's _A Clockwork Orange_.I couldn't stop thinking about the warden: doesn't he have a family? How did\u000athey feel? What are they going to do now? I realize the story is inside the\u000aprison, but I wish the movie had made better use of its characters than\u000asimply as simple-minded symbols of EVIL or VIRTUE.I'm not Mr. Cranky, I did enjoy the movie, but I enjoyed it the same way I\u000ado an Italian dinner at the Olive Garden--a well-constructed genre product\u000awith nothing special to commend it. \u000a

V\u000aThe amazing thing about this film is how many people fail to realise\u000athat the film is about Red, not Andy. It's Reds perspective of Andy. I\u000aonly mention it because many people strangely think its told from the\u000aperspective of Andy.That common misunderstanding behind, a well made film. The photography\u000ais magical, the story is strong, the performances are exceptional and\u000athe depths of despair and humanity of canvassed well without losing\u000amainstream appeal.But that aside, there is a strong willingness to overstate this film.\u000aIn the end, it is a slightly overdone and there is a bit too much\u000a'triumph of the human spirit' dribble on the side. But I don't let that\u000aget in the way of what is otherwise a very good film with\u000are-watch-ability.Hadley's release from prison and letter deserves a spot in cinema\u000ahistory. That part was absolutely exceptional.\u000a

V\u000aI really liked this movie, which I just recently saw for the first\u000atime, strange indeed since it is more than 10 years old. It reminded\u000ame, naturally I would say, to Papillon, the 70's McQueen/Hoffman\u000aclassic.I like the story, the acting, basically everything, and I definitely\u000arecommend it to everybody. But compared to Papillon? There are so many\u000asimilarities that one has to think that idea of the movie did not came\u000aout of the blue. Because of that the movie has to accept to be compared\u000awith Papillon. And Papillon is simply even better. It is emotionally\u000amuch more touching, and when even Freeman's great performance doesn't\u000amatch Hoffman's, there is no doubt that Robbins is not close to McQueen\u000a- in that role I mean! Tim gave a great performance but his role didn't\u000agive him the chance that Steve had.Anyway, a joy to watch. But please watch the "original" too, it's not\u000aold-fashioned at all! I can only guess, but I think the huge\u000adifferential of 9.1 for SR and 7.9 for Papillon is because most young\u000apeople have never seen Papillon.\u000a

V\u000a'The Shawshank Redemption'... hmm where do I start. 'The Shawshank\u000aRedemption' is clearly one of the greatest films ever, I find that it\u000areally can show what it would be like trapped in a tiny little prison,\u000aeventually you would only think of what's outside the prison instead of\u000ainside or you might even become attached to the prison or should I say\u000ahome.What the audience really enjoy's about this movie is that you have been\u000adeceived for you believe through out most of the movie that there is\u000anoway out for poor Andy Dufresne and that he is trying to be nice to\u000athe guards for a chance of believable. After that you discover that the\u000awhole film and everything that has happened has all gone towards the\u000aescape of Andy Dufresne and the suicide of the dreadful warden. The\u000aaudience has been gullible enough to believe that Andy was getting used\u000ato the prison. 'The Shawshank Redemption' is clearly not just a movie, it is also\u000abeautiful art. Every little piece of the movie was delicately put\u000atogether to create pure yet daunting art.The story is about Andy Dufresne a wealthy intelligent banker who's\u000awife is having an affair with another man. Eventually both the wife and\u000athe other man are killed while having sex, with all evidence pointing\u000ato Andy, Andy is sentenced to two life times of prison. In prison Andy\u000adoes a lot of the workers at the prison's (and that include's the\u000awarden) banking. From then of the story is all about Andy in the prison\u000aand he idea's of hope and love of music.One of the most beautiful and touching moments in the movie is when\u000aAndy locks all the doors in the room that has the microphone and plays\u000aopera music of two Italian women singing opera in Italian. Morgen\u000aFreeman then say's that he had no idea what the two Italian women were\u000asinging but doesn't want to know, he just like to imagine that the\u000awords were too beautiful to be sung in English.The acting is brilliant and the directing is directed absolutely\u000aunbelievably tremendous. I praise both Morgan Freeman and Tim Robbins\u000afor a very touching movie that I will always remember.In conclusion, 'The Shawshank Redemption is one of the greatest films\u000aever that I have ever seen, if you do not like it I will also\u000aunderstand that you didn't listen closer to the brilliant word that\u000awere able to come out of the actors mouth.Hope is a dangerous thing.\u000a

V\u000aEmotion, hope and justice all blend perfectly in this film. Quite\u000asimply, no other film comes close to this one in regards to screenplay,\u000acasting and plot development. No spoilers here - just a comment on a\u000amovie that can still move you to tears even after multiple viewings.\u000aMorgan Freeman delivers the performance of a lifetime. Everything else\u000acomes together in perfect harmony. This movie came out the same year as\u000aForrest Gump which won the Oscar for best picture - Forrest Gump is a\u000agreat picture but this one really deserved the "cake". Tim Robbins is\u000aAMAZING as Andy, and he supported brilliantly by a cast that one could\u000aonly hope to see assembled again. This is one of those rare occasions\u000awhere the movie actually surpasses the book for drama, suspense and\u000aflow. If you haven't seen this film, please do yourself the favour and\u000awatch it. I know you will not be disappointed!"Get busy livin'"\u000a

V\u000aShawshank is one of the only movies I have ever scored as 10 out of 10.\u000aI had read the Stephen King short long before I saw the movie, and\u000aloved it, but had no idea going into the movie that it was the same\u000astory. Halfway thru the movie I finally put two and two together and\u000aalmost jumped out of my seat at the theater to say "OMG, I love this\u000astory!" Fortunately I managed to resist and hide the fact that I'm\u000atotally freaking insane for at least one more day...But I digress. The movie stars Tim Robbins as Andy Dufraine, a man\u000aconvicted of murdering his wife. He is sentenced to life at Shawshank\u000aprison. Although convicted of the same type of brutal crime as his\u000afellow inmates, it quickly becomes apparent that Andy is an oddity at\u000aShawshank. Highly educated, quiet and philosophical, Andy is initially\u000aa source of curiosity and unease to his fellow inmates but is soon\u000abefriended by Ellis 'Red' Redding, played by Morgan Freeman, and\u000aquickly becomes one of their own.Without giving too much away, the movie follows Andy's life in prison,\u000aas narrated by Freeman, as he finds a way to both survive and hold on\u000ato a shred of his humanity in a place that seeks to rob him of both.\u000aAndy learns, for example, to bargain with what he has (i.e. his\u000afinancial knowledge) for what he needs. Initially, many of the things\u000aAndy acquires during the course of the film seem to have little value,\u000abut you realize by the end of the film that what he has asked for has\u000ahad value beyond measure, both in the pragmatic sense and in a deeper\u000aphilosophical sense.The movie is at its core an exploration of what it is to be human. It\u000ais about loss, regret, perseverance, friendship, and ultimately, faith.\u000aHow do we deal with the mistakes that we have made in life? How do we\u000arecover when life beats us down? And how can we seek strength in our\u000aconnections to others? These are all ideas that Shawshank looks at. It\u000ais alternately funny, tragic, violent, and inspirational. Probably one\u000aof the best stories King ever wrote and without question one of the\u000abest films ever made.\u000a

V\u000a\u000aI think that the Shawshank Redemption is one of the best movies ever made.\u000aThe acting is crisp and full of endless tension, sometimes forlorn and on\u000aother occasions full of fear. How Stephen King could come up with a horror\u000astory like this is beyond me. It's a real nightmare to be in a penal system\u000awith so many things going against you. Personally, I think that Forrest Gump\u000a(FG) is also a tale of Hope, but in a different sense. Firstly, FG shows the\u000ahope of waiting for the woman you love for over 20 years. Secondly, FG shows\u000athat there can be hope for mentally disabled people to continue in society\u000aand aim for goals. I think that both movies are great and should not be\u000amissed or inappropiately criticised.\u000aI also urge people to watch La Vita e bella (Life is beautiful) as it is as\u000agood as The Shawshank Redemption and has some similar points.\u000aMay we all hope for more movies like these.PS Also watch It's a Wonderful Life (James Stewart) as this is about hope as\u000awell. \u000a

V\u000aI saw this movie for the first time a year ago. In those days I was\u000abrowsing the IMDb when I saw this movie ranked #2 in the top 250. That\u000awas very weird for me because I never heard about "The Shawshank\u000aRedemption" before. So I decided to go and rent it immediately. After\u000awatching the movie I was positively surprised. Definitely this is the\u000abest movie I've ever seen. The story, the direction and the cast\u000a(Specially Tim, Morgan and Gil Bellows) are perfect! The Shawshank\u000aRedemption really deserves that spot in the rankings. This movie is a\u000a"must see"! Thanks IMDb and all IMDb users for the top 250 and the\u000awake-up call!\u000a

V\u000aThe best movie I've ever seen. I've seen her more than twenty times and\u000ait's always perfect. On the 10th year anniversary DVD edition Frank\u000aDarabont claims that the movie has helped people through divorces and\u000alosing love ones and so on, just see the movie and you'll understand\u000awhy.The scene were Andy Dufresne finally gets out of Shawshank and he's\u000astanding in the rain and raising his hands is one of the better scenes\u000ain the movie history. I've got that poster up on my wall. It's amazing\u000ahow you feel brightened when you see that particular scene.Try seeing the movie a couple of times, and then reading the book which\u000ais written by Steven King, and then seeing the movie again.

V\u000aThis particular movie is the absolute best ever and should be rated #1\u000aof all times.With all the pages of comments that have been posted on this site; I\u000awill not even attempt to add to the eloquence of the previous comments.I have noticed that many people have posted that they did not see this\u000amovie in the theaters. I would not even watch the movie on VHS as my\u000awife and children begged me to take a look at the film.The title did not appeal to me and I did not understand the title. I\u000adon't particularly like any prison movies. I just would not watch the\u000afilm and I was probably watching ten movies per week at that time.I finally watched when one night; I could find nothing appealing in the\u000avideo store. From that moment in 1997; I've probably watched the movie\u000aabout 20 times per year for the last eight years.People refer to all the "classics" as being such masterpieces; but, I\u000adisagree. "Citizen Kane", "Some Like It Hot", "African Queen",\u000aCasablanca", "Godfather" and all the others can not compete with\u000aanything about this movie.\u000a

V\u000aThanx to everybody who helped to put Shawshank back to rank 2 in the\u000atop 250, in front of LotR3, where it belongs. I've seen this movie\u000aabout 20 times and I never get tired of it. That's what makes a movie\u000athe best. The first 2 in the top 250 are where they belong. The 3\u000aLotR-movies should be out of the top 10. They should create a category\u000afor special effects. Put them on top there. But for a great movie it\u000aneed a lot more then effects. The story of Shawshank is absolutely\u000agreat. The actors did their best. It's still a shame, that this great\u000amovie didn't got a single Oscar. It could have win the best picture in\u000amost years against all winners.\u000a

V\u000a\u000aOk.  It wasn't that bad.  In fact, there's a lot to like about this movie.\u000aBut there was absolutely no reason why this movie needed to go on and on\u000aand\u000aon and on.Excellent acting of course:  Freeman is always right on target and Tim\u000aRobbins is very good (although I happen to dislike his political views and\u000athat inhibits my ability to imagine he's anyone else but Robbins up there\u000aon\u000athe screen).Its a movie that makes one think about the important things in life, and\u000ait\u000adoes that without being preachy.However, I don't like the way it uses cliches all the way through, i.e.\u000athe\u000abad warden who is a pseudo-Christian.  Hollywood has shown much hatred\u000atowards Christianity,  and this is only one more movie in a long string\u000awhich tries to make Christians look bad.****spoilers ahead********Also, it is simply not believable that (a) the prison would not have moved\u000aAndy in 19 years of prison life, and (b) the sound of his rock scraping\u000awouldn't have been heard and (c) he wouldn't have been seen "underneath"\u000athe\u000aposter, working away at the wall.I find it hard to believe furthermore, that Andy would go back into the\u000atown\u000awhere he proposed, just to leave money under that rock.  An escaped\u000aconvict\u000awould not want to be anywhere near where people may recognize him, if he\u000ahad\u000aany smarts, which Andy did.But those things alone did not prevent me from enjoying the movie, I just\u000adon't think the movie lived up to its hype, and I would feel no need to\u000aever\u000awatch it again (and I always watch my favs over and over\u000aagain!).\u000a

V\u000aThe Shawshank Redemption is an example of magical film-making at its\u000abest. When I say best, I really mean it. There are a lot of great films\u000aout there, and a lot that make me glad I saw them. But Shawshank is,\u000aabove all of them, at the top of the list.I love this film. Every time any part of it appears on TNT I stay to\u000awatch until the end. I just got the DVD on New Years Eve and watched\u000athe whole thing through until 12:34 am. It was the most enjoyable thing\u000aI could have watched that night.Every part of the story is engrossing from the very first scene. The\u000afilm has a way about itself that is uniquely its own. From the way it\u000ais shot to the musical score (a masterpiece by Thomas Newman).Any film enthusiast, writer, storyteller, actor, or human being must\u000awatch this film. It is masterfully executed from one scene to the next,\u000apristinely edited, and in so many words...perfect. I myself am a\u000afilmmaker and have hard time watching even great films without judging\u000awhat I consider mistakes scene-by-scene. Shawshank pulls me out of that\u000aawareness and into a wonderful story and I have watched again and\u000aagain. It never stops being great. As a writer or storyteller I have the utmost respect for Mr. Daramont\u000aas well as Mr. King. The dialog throughout the film is understated and\u000amagnificent. There are more than half a dozen classic, memorable scenes\u000athat I consider iconic from this film. And to top it off, the\u000aperformances from all the actors, specifically Mr. Freeman and Mr.\u000aRobbins, are timeless.If you have not seen The Shawshank Redemption please make a point to\u000amake sure you do at some point soon. It is one of the best films ever\u000amade.\u000a

V\u000a\u000aThe Shawshank Redemption is easily my favorite movie of all time. It has\u000a every single element that should be looked for in a film. A brilliant\u000a script (with the best dialogue ever written), a perfect cast (not one bad\u000a performance), and not to mention an original, complex and ultimately\u000a uplifting story.Based on the Stephen King novel, Shawshank Redemption is a delight from\u000a first scene to last. The opening is a brilliantly done sequence with Andy's\u000a (Tim Robbins) trial intercut with his actions on the night of his crime.\u000a This leads to him being taken to Shawshank with one of the best shots ever\u000a captured on film, with the camera sweeping from behind the prison bus in\u000a the air and diving into the middle of the prison yard. There Andy meets Red\u000a (Morgan Freeman) and others, and a gradual friendship begins to\u000a develop.This movie has that certain indefinable screen magic, every line of dialogue\u000a spoken has real conviction and meaning, and the performances in this movie\u000a are nothing short of magnificent. Tim Robbins delivers his best screen\u000a performance ever, as the quietly spoken Andy. Here is a character like no\u000a other, so vivid, so real, that you can't help but like him. Morgan Freeman\u000a also delivers his best work ever as Red, Andy's friend. Freeman, while\u000a playing a different character from Robbins, is also able to give off a\u000a quiet dignity for his character. The supporting cast is perfect. From Bob Gunton, chillingly evil, but never\u000a over the top as to become cartoonish, as the Warden. Clancy Brown, as the\u000a prison Guard Hadley is brilliant, as is Veteran James Whitmore, as Brooks,\u000a who while given relatively small screen time is brilliant as the lifer con\u000a who's sad journey the film details.There is not a dull moment or poor line of dialogue in this film. Credit\u000a first time director Frank Darabont for this remarkable piece of work. He is\u000a a director of the future. I still can't believe this was his first movie!,\u000a he will find it hard to top this masterful film. Special mention must be\u000a made of the music score by Thomas Newman, who has composed a simple, but\u000a perfect score for this film. His scoring of the scene with Andy and Red\u000a sitting up against the wall discussing their plans for release is nothing\u000a short of brilliant, as is the rest of his score.I encourage everyone who has not seen this to grab it now, as it is surely\u000a not only the best movie of the 90's but the best movie of all time.***** out of *****\u000a

V\u000asimply the best movie ever made. this movie embraces the philosophy\u000athat justice will be done, karma is heard and that goodness will rule\u000aabove anything in this world. Andy and reds friendship is a strong\u000aunique bond, founded under the harshest of circumstances. In prison\u000athey each serve their time for situations they got themselves into, but\u000acertainly didn't form them as men - or messed with their true\u000acharacter. Andy has no choice but to try and accept his fate, that he\u000awill be in Shawshank forever - and on the surface he rises to the\u000aoccasion by doing the paperwork for the sadistic warden, who treats\u000aAndy like the lowest of the low. In the meantime Reds parole is\u000acontinuously declined, and they both have to re-adjust, even though\u000atheir life in prison sometimes offers them glimpses of hope and of\u000afreedom. Will the time really come, and if yes...are they ready for it?\u000a

V\u000aAn excellent movie that can surely move you a bit. It throws open the\u000aquestion that can we really have prisons which are redemption centers\u000ain the true sense. At the same time, it redefines the word criminal.\u000aAre the heinous acts committed by administrative authorities\u000ajustifiable by any means. There should be a code of conduct for the\u000aauthorities and a HOLY PRISON MAINTENANCE BIBLE if any reformation has\u000ato take place. The movie goes through several touching incidents and\u000amay bore you a bit if you rarely sees serious touching movies and are\u000afans of slick sci-fi thrillers moving at extraordinary pace like Matrix\u000aetc. However the exceptional acting by lead stars particularly by\u000aMorgan Freeman and the picking up of the tempo in the second half will\u000aleave you gasping for more. After Citizen Kane, Casablanca & Godfather,\u000ait is another classic that will stay in the echelons of the movie\u000arating lists for long. There are a few weak points though. There was\u000ainsufficient attention given to some characters and movie portrays just\u000aone side of the whole story not remaining fair to the prison\u000aauthorities. And finally if it was told in a non-linear tale then it\u000awould have been much more interesting\u000a

V\u000aI have literally just turned off the DVD player after watching this\u000afilm for the very first (and last) time after so much hype I thought it\u000awas about time. I sat all the way through it and did enjoy it, but I\u000areally don't see what all the fuss is about. Yes it is a good film, yes\u000ait is a good plot. However I had guessed the outcome and a few bits\u000awithin the film before the flashback at the end, and therefore for me\u000athere were no unexpected twists. I wasn't even moved at the end. In\u000afact all in all I was a bit disappointed, as my friends who have seen\u000ait said that they had cried and it was such a brilliant film. Am I\u000aabnormal???????? I think the green mile was better and I did cry at the\u000aend of that. I'm sorry if I upset any of you who think it is the best\u000afilm ever, but I don't.\u000a

V\u000aI simply fail to understand how this film is so popular... it's quite\u000asimply beyond me. The only way I can explain it is that all the fans of\u000aKing's short story found it very true to the spirit of the book, and\u000avoted 10 for that. I really could not find anything worth my time in\u000athis film, and apart from a very good monologue from Freeman near the\u000aend, one or two good lines of dialog and the acting, there's really\u000anothing in the whole film worth watching it for. It's about hope... and\u000athe director won't let us forget it, so it's repeated until the\u000aaudience mumbles it in our sleep. It's like this short, one-note story\u000awas written, and the author just didn't want to end it... so he kept\u000awriting... and writing... until someone had the sense to break down the\u000adoor and wrestle the pen from him yelling "for the love of all that is\u000aholy, stop writing!" And I thank that faceless man for doing that,\u000abecause it is undoubtedly the only reason the film was 142 minutes\u000along, and not 284, or, dare I say it, 568. The film simply drones on\u000aand on, scene after scene, containing nothing remotely interesting(but\u000awith excellent acting, mind you). There's nothing good about this film\u000aexcept for the acting. Just about all of it is great. I can't really\u000athink of anything else to say... I guess my dislike for the film stems\u000afrom my hatred of King's writing. I suppose it is possible for someone\u000awho is neutral on his works to enjoy this film. I recommend this to\u000afans of Stephen King, the actors and possibly Frank Darabont. If you're\u000anot a fan of any of these people, I doubt you'd find this enjoyable.\u000a5/10\u000a

V\u000aShawshank Redemption is another great movie. This movie is telling\u000aabout the Andy Dufresne's life, performed by Tim Robbins. He is a young\u000abanker who has a high opportunity in his job, then his life is turning\u000ainto the dark, he has to move into a jail just because the court judged\u000athat he killed his wife and adulterer while he did not do anything.\u000aThis point shows me about gap in the law and how the justice court\u000abecomes unfair, it's like a reflection of the reality and i do like it.\u000aHowever, the story is told by Red, Morgan Freeman, a close friend of\u000aAndy while he was in a prison, it broadcasts every single things in\u000aprison, such like right, equality, freedom, and corruption. That's why\u000athe movie can persuade the audiences to believe that Andy was really\u000awrong. The story is telling very silently, but the unexpected situation\u000ais coming up continuously.It does not make me surprise when I heard that Shawshank got many\u000aawards, even many people said that Forrest Gump is better than it and\u000agot the rewards more. In my opinion, I think it is because Shawshank is\u000ahard for understanding sometimes and the audiences did not get it. It's\u000alike this movie is telling by the third party and it was just a new\u000astyle of a movie at that time. Deeply, It is amazing for me because I\u000acannot guess what is the truth, what is not.\u000a

V\u000aThe Shawshank Redemption is written by Stephen King and directed by\u000aFrank Darabont, this two men also produced the film named 'the green\u000amile'. This film is about one young and successful man who works in\u000abank named 'Andy Dufresne who is convicted by court that he murdered\u000ahis wife and her lover. This made him has to get in the jail named\u000aShawshank, which has many friendship, injustice, ferocity, and hope.\u000aWith the good storytelling make this film isn't that boring although\u000ait's a long movie but we all forget the time while watch it. This story\u000ashow many sides of the society, show the part of prisoners that do not\u000aget the acceptance from the society, show the part of many richer who\u000ahas power but corruption the society. The injustice between people and\u000aprisoners make this film is interesting. With the good a casting, story\u000atelling, edited, sound technical and many things make is film is\u000aperfect. As you know that this film is the best movie on IMDb and I\u000aalso guarantee that this movie will make you impress.\u000a

V\u000aI just said 'representation of world', because actually it is ! The\u000ashawshank redemption showed how world is cruel and cannot be\u000aforecasted, by using limited area and place with specific characters.\u000aIt is quite old film but, still can be explained this era. I tried to\u000awatch this film as 2 kinds of views. First, I saw the shawshank jail\u000arepresent as the human society. In limited place, people really want to\u000amake their own 'laws and rules' for them. Sometimes, it looks like\u000anonsense nor illogical but, we;I mean human did actually and.. In this\u000asociety, there is invisible hierarchy also. Secondly, This film showed\u000ahow people are survive with their own way in society. Some people do\u000anot understand the change, and also some other people are against the\u000alaws and rules, such as Andy. Especially, Brooks who kill himself\u000ashowed the people who do not accept the change their environment. I can\u000asee myself, which kind of people am I? This film tells us many things,\u000anot only these. When time after time, it will be showed different way,\u000aso sure.\u000a

V\u000aThe best Hollywood movie I've ever seen. The screenplay, the background\u000ascore, the story line is epic and original. I just wish there is a\u000aShawshank redemption 2. Morgan freeman's acting is one of the best as a\u000asupporting actor. The mood swings rigorously through every emotion as\u000athe cranky, wiseguy and downright crazed array of criminals bare the\u000abrunt of the turbulent life within the doomy Shawshank catacomb. Then\u000ait gets really mean, gearing up for its injury-time shockers. Dufresne,\u000aa whiz with figures, is bullied into running the warden's (Gunton)\u000apetty accounting scams, giving him the chance to execute his and the\u000afilm's final, greatest miracle.\u000a

V\u000aShawshank is a good example of how adaptation works - or more\u000aspecifically, how changes made to the original story in translation\u000aoften benefit the finished product. The best example of this is the\u000acharacter of Red, who in the original novel is a red-headed Irishman.\u000aThis is referred to jokingly by Morgan Freeman in one of his first\u000aconversations with Tim Robbins; when Andy asks why people call him Red,\u000aRed responds: "Maybe it's because I'm Irish.".On top of Freeman's obvious ability, the casting decision makes sense\u000abecause it adds an extra layer of meaning to the character. Red is one\u000aof the few black characters we come across; while he applies himself in\u000adifferent ways, he is as much of an outsider as Andy DuFresne. This is\u000aborne out by his remarks about institutionalization, which are laughed\u000aoff by his fellow inmates. Red may be well-connected when it comes to\u000asmuggling things in, but otherwise he is just as lonely as Andy.Shawshank approaches the theme of institutionalization with great grace\u000aand dexterity. Because the story takes place over three decades, the\u000atemptation would be to canter through the plot points and cut straight\u000ato Andy's escape - you could even stage the entire story in flashback.\u000aInstead, Darabont allows the film to unfold at a gentle, gradual pace,\u000areflecting the mind-set of the characters. They don't realize how\u000atrapped they are until it's too late, just as we don't realize that\u000atwo-and-a-half hours has passed until the credits have begun to roll.The characters reflect the different extents and effects of\u000ainstitutionalization. Brooks has built his entire identity around his\u000abooks and role in the prison; he is so afraid of this being taken away\u000athat he attempts to kill William Sadler's character so he can stay\u000ainside. Red is aware of how trapped he is, and shares Brooks' fears,\u000abeing unsure that he could get things for Andy on the outside. But at\u000athe same time, he refuses to let himself be vulnerable, trying to play\u000athe system and constantly getting turned down for parole. Andy allows\u000ahimself to be vulnerable and endures all the pain that it brings him,\u000asustained by the knowledge of his innocence and the hope that he will\u000aescape.Shawshank is perhaps the most powerful depiction of hope in all of\u000acinema. The original short story, Rita Hayworth and Shawshank\u000aRedemption, was subtitled 'Hope Springs Eternal'. The film returns to\u000ahope and the celebration of the human spirit like a leitmotif, and\u000asucceeds because it retains Andy's humanity in all its many shades.\u000aWhile he is very different to the other prisoners, he is never\u000apresented as a saint or goody-goody, smiling gormless in the face of\u000amaddening torment. This makes his endurance all the more powerful: we\u000arecognize our faults in his moments of weakness, and aspire to his\u000ainner moral strength.The film has attracted many Christian interpretations - in fact, in my\u000areview of John Carpenter's The Thing, I called it "a poster child for\u000aChristianity". It's not hard to see why, considering its celebration of\u000ainner strength and devotion, and its overall arc of good triumph over\u000aevil against the greatest odds. While Andy has been called a Christ\u000afigure, he's just as close to the character of Daniel in the Old\u000aTestament: he finds himself in a strange land against his will, and in\u000aorder to survive he applies his natural talents to the service of his\u000atemporal masters. Through his labors the people around him benefit and\u000athe system is eventually changed for the better - albeit through pain,\u000asuffering and several deaths.An equally intriguing interpretation comes from Mark Kermode, who\u000aauthored a BFI Modern Classic on the film in 2003. In a video\u000adiscussing cinematic depictions of Richard Nixon, Kermode made the\u000aargument that Warden Norton (played brilliantly by Bob Gunton) is an\u000aallegory for Nixon, with Andy's prison term matching Nixon's political\u000acareer. Norton begins reaching out for friendship (Nixon seeking to be\u000aelected), then becomes the corrupt leader (beginning in the year that\u000aKennedy was shot), and finally descends into paranoia and disgrace,\u000aculminating in a more literal suicide than Nixon offered us.Whether you believe these interpretations or not, Shawshank is a\u000aterrific piece of dramatic film-making which soars on the strengths of\u000aits main performers. Tim Robbins perfectly captures Andy's distant,\u000aethereal quality while retaining his wry and infectious sense of humor.\u000aMorgan Freeman's performance may well be responsible for his subsequent\u000atype-casting, but he matches Robbins beat for beat, offsetting hope\u000awith world-weariness and guilt. There's also great support from two\u000aactors who would subsequently work with Darabont again - William Sadler\u000a(who appears in The Green Mile) and James Whitmore (The Majestic).The Shawshank Redemption may not be entirely worthy of its number one\u000aranking on IMDb, but it remains a really terrific piece of drama let\u000adown only by its final scene. In every other aspect it's a masterpiece,\u000aas a character piece, a treatise on hope and a beautifully paced and\u000amounted Stephen King adaptation. It remains a must-see for all film\u000afans of penchant or persuasion, earning its status as a modern classic\u000aand securing a warm place in our hearts.\u000a

V\u000aThis work from 1994 directed and written by a Hungarian-American Frank\u000aDarabont that was based on Stephen King's novella Rita Hayworth and\u000aShawshank Redemption was nominated for several highly appreciated\u000aawards, including The Academy Awards and The Golden Globe Awards. In\u000aspite of being nominated for so many prestigious prizes, it did not win\u000aany. However, this fact cannot put a shadow over the fantastic job that\u000awas done while making the movie. Critics from all over the world were\u000aabsolutely amazed by the drama with outstanding and unbelievably\u000arealistic scenery. It is simply a must to pay a great respect to the\u000amain protagonists  experienced Morgan Freeman as Red, a man who will\u000aprovide you with everything you need, and irreplaceable Tim Robbins as\u000aAndy Dufresne, a banker who was unjustly convicted of murdering his\u000awife and her lover.The story starts in the late 1940's when a banker Andy Dufresne is\u000asentenced to two consecutive life sentences at the Shawshank State\u000aPenitentiary for murdering his wife and her lover. He instantly becomes\u000aa friend with a contraband smuggler and the film's narrator Ellis "Red"\u000aRedding who procures a rock hammer for Andy so he can create small\u000astone chess pieces. Soon, Andy unleashes his financial skills when he\u000aoverhears the merciless guard chief Hadley complaining about taxes.\u000aThanks to his former occupation, Andy is given a position in the\u000alibrary so he can manage financial matters for Shawshank. As the years\u000apass, Norton, the head of the prison, uses the library and public works\u000aworked by prison labor to undercut skilled labor costs so he can\u000areceive huge kickbacks. Andy is used for laundering the money using the\u000aalias "Randall Stephens". In the mid-1960's young Tommy Williams, an\u000airredeemable burglar, is imprisoned. He gets close with Andy and Red\u000aand when hearing the details of Andy's case begins to talk about his\u000aformer inmate. He explains that the inmate told him how he had killed\u000atwo people and got away with it which seems to be a proof of Andy's\u000ainnocence. Unfortunately, as soon as Norton hears a word about it, he\u000ahas young Tommy shot by Hadley. This appears to be enough for Andy. He\u000atells Red about his secret dream of living in a Mexican coastal village\u000aand instructs him how to get there when he is free. The next day,\u000aAndy's cell is found empty. Norton and the guards find out that Andy\u000aescaped through a tunnel which he had dug with his rock hammer over the\u000aprevious two decades. While they are searching for him, Andy, as\u000aRandall Stephens, visits a large number of banks to withdraw the\u000alaundered money. Besides that, he sends a package with evidence of what\u000ahas happened at the prison to a regional newspaper. Will the police and\u000athe newspaper trust Andy? Will he and Red ever meet again? Go and watch\u000athe bravura ending.It is hard to find a more proper word for the film than a masterpiece.\u000aThe Shawshank Redemption is an opportunity to witness how fate is the\u000abest judge in the end, how a frightened cat can turn into a brave lion\u000aand how a friendship can be developed even in the darkest moments of\u000aones' lives. Next, I was really impressed by the perfect narrating\u000askills of Mr. Freeman. The actor's storytelling keeps you deeply\u000asettled in your seat and you are able to literally breathe the story. I\u000ahaven't seen such a well-thought-out plot like this in a long time. The\u000adiligent work of the producers, cameramen, costume designers, make-up\u000aand hair stylists and all of the crew will be remembered. I can't write\u000athis without mentioning the set. I have already talked about it, but I\u000aneed to praise it a little bit more. It was so easy to get into the\u000aplot thanks to the set  you do not get a chance to doubt the realism\u000aof the scenery. Another aspect to be spotlighted is the soundtrack.\u000aMagnificent Thomas Newman and his team produced a piece of quality\u000amaterial which does not stay unnoticed and bonds you even more with the\u000awhole drama. Last but not least, I must applaud the directing and\u000ascreen writing of Mr. Darabont who created a completely unique and new\u000aexperience for TV viewers and cinema audiences. We can only guess what\u000ahappens in the end until we finally get to see the finish line of\u000aShawshank. I guarantee you will end up with a wide smile on your face.To sum up, we can only thank the entire crew for the spectacular\u000aproject with an inspiring story of not giving up. The conclusion of my\u000areview is as brief as it can be  go and book your place in front of\u000athe big screen! You will not regret it. The massive number of emotions\u000ayou can experience while watching The Shawshank Redemption will make\u000ayou laugh or cry whenever you want.\u000a

V\u000aThis is not just a film. This is not just a work of art that transcends\u000athe black and white of human outlook to caste, justice and freedom and\u000apaints the human soul in all its true colors. This is not just life set\u000ain motion that takes us through it all - jealousy, hopelessness, irony,\u000atragedy, monotony, inspiration, perseverance, success, and the unending\u000amiracle that is life itself. This is all of these and more."The Shawshank Redemption" is as much about the story it tells as about\u000athe way it tells it. We have to really immerse ourselves to understand\u000aand share the lead character's exuberance of redemption that is the\u000aprincipal focal point of the entire film. And the slow and steady\u000aunfolding of events in an apparent idyllic manner makes it very easy\u000afor us viewers to get engrossed into this wonderfully threaded,\u000aemotionally rich story.All the actors in the film were in perfect tune with one another. Never\u000afor once did any of them give an impression that this is a work of\u000afiction and not a true incident captured on camera in real time. Tim\u000aRobbins is easily the finest of the cast, portraying the initially\u000aderanged, subsequently fearful and tentative, and ultimately the\u000aemancipated Andy Dufresne with total compulsion. Morgan Freeman is\u000aequally captivating as the wise and ever-supportive "Red" Redding, with\u000ahis wry indifference to the sufferings of life, which finally gives way\u000aplain and raw happiness at his own emancipation.This is a film that makes us appreciate the beauty and subtlety of\u000alife, soothes our soul, gives us hope and inspires us to keep trying\u000atill we reach our own "redemption" - our own freedom from the failures\u000athat bind us to the success that we always crave. This is film of life,\u000afor life, and a film to live by.\u000a

V\u000aThe Shawshank Redemption actually an outstanding film that come up with\u000aa story of dealing with prisons as seen by several prisoner. In the\u000amovie show many social problems, which are all discussed in the movie.\u000aAlso it has a emotionally attached at the end of the film it almost\u000amake me cry out. This movie can capture and identify with American male\u000aspirit as it shows in movie. The movie actually talking about the\u000adevelopment of friendship between Red and Andy is charming and\u000aappealing. For this movie is consisting of a beautiful personal film\u000afantastic acting well crafted story, great scenes, great characters and\u000aawesome plot, which make this movie turn out this good. It's the most\u000atouching and heart warming film of human spirit that I have seen and it\u000amight be a great movie to watch with family and be one of the best\u000amovies of all time.

So, he was in jail at\u000aShawshank. He had to bear with wickedness everyday.It's kind of normal movie that is just a good man in the prison that\u000aeverything is very frightful.

V\u000aI think everyone who saw this movie will like it. If you are director\u000aor director photography, this is the best technique of camera shot. It\u000alooks like a easy shot but it will be great. Some shot in this movie i\u000athink it will use after effects for making that shot but in that time i\u000athink adobe just was born. Thus the director of this movie is\u000aintelligent. He can make a lot of technique in that time but some shot\u000ahas a mistake. We will can observe some shot is not real or unusual. I\u000athink overall are great. I copy some technique to improve my film too.\u000aThe actors of movie are smart. They make the audience believe with\u000atheir acting. I love it too much.\u000a

V\u000aSimple but complicate. This movie is great movie in element of the\u000astory telling. I haven't known the plot before; I thought It was a\u000aregular movie but it wasn't. It is one of the best movie that I ever\u000aseen. Frank Darabont did a great job and he has directed clearly story.\u000aHe makes every character in the movie become important in the movie.\u000aFirstly, I thought Anny was tried to survive in the prison day by day.\u000aRed he was a leader of the prisoner. At first I thought he would have a\u000aconflict with Anny because He imported things from outside the prison\u000ato sold in prison to make a profit for himself. Anny always asked for\u000adifferent thing from other prisoners with him. But truly he had a\u000acoolest plan for getting out of prison. The story was complicated but\u000astory was telling smoothie because he had plan to escape from the\u000aprison. He made the warden trust him by working for him. The warden\u000aused him to did his dirty work even he had destroyed the last evidence\u000athat Anny wasn't guilt. Finally, Anny payback by a very cleaver plan. So, If you are the fan of prison brake movie. You must watch.\u000a

This story\u000awas told by Red's point of view. Red is a friend of the main character.\u000aYou will never know the main character thinking about. The way to tell\u000astory was great which is to show defectiveness of social, justic\u000asystem, and corruption but the main character can handle his problem\u000avery well. Another thing is the main character was a good man even he\u000awent to the prison he did not change himself to be bad. He still doing\u000aa good things for other people.

V\u000aThe movie is amazing.First let me begin with the theme of the movie. The theme and the\u000aconcept of the movie is quit predictable because before watching i know\u000athat it is a movie about a main character try to break out the the\u000aprison and i am quit sure that at the end the main character will\u000asucceed and it is definitely like what i thought. but what make this\u000amovie great are what is in the movie. All the detail that are given and\u000atoward the running of the story line that make it is unpredictable for\u000ame of what going to happen next even though i already know that he will\u000abreak out of the prison successfully.The setting of the movie is not much special because most of the time\u000ait is in the prison so not much to talk about, but it is still great\u000athat we as a viewer got the see how a real prison look like a how does\u000ait really feel as we follow the main character throughout the whole\u000amovie.The lighting of the movie is pretty dark and giving a sad and hopeless\u000afeeling to us viewer so it is great that we get to feel what the\u000acharacters feel too.This movie gave me a point of view of a people who is in a prison for\u000ato long and don't have a clue of what they will do if they ever got a\u000achance to come out again or not. This movie contain many emotion\u000afeeling of the character and really done well on delivering it to us\u000aviewing.The casting of the movie is amazing all the character and the actor\u000areally look believable like they are who they are.After watched the movie, it gave me so many thing to think about and\u000ahow hard and how corrupt the world is today, even though the world we\u000alive on now is on the different era but there will always be a bad man,\u000aand it will never change. We just need to do what is right and continue\u000adoing it.\u000a

V\u000aNo words that i can think of even comes close of how amazing this movie\u000areally is. its funny, thrilling and bone chilling. what i really love\u000aabout this movie is that you really feel for the characters as if they\u000awere family. when Brooke's committed suicide I was holding on a pillow\u000ashouting. It has it moment, and the greatest flaw of this movie in my\u000aopinion is pacing. The Shawshank Redemption may be a tad slow, but it\u000ais justified. I believe director Frank Darabont wanted to show Andy's\u000atime at Shawshank by showing how slow prison time really is. Some\u000amovies are just slow; this movie does it for a deeper reason, adding to\u000aShawshank's genius.Adding to the slow pacing, Andy acting is neutral is bare shows\u000aemotion. Which is charming in a way, because Straight face can\u000amagically immerse you in a weird way. Neo from the Matrix series for\u000ainstance. Tim Robbins did this on purpose. Andy was quiet, mellow, and\u000awas obviously quite shocked and angry he was going to prison for a\u000acrime he didn't do. I feel like the fact that he acted like this just\u000aadded to the realistic atmosphere of the movie.In one word, a masterpiece Have come at the wrong time. Nevertheless,\u000astill an unforgettable movie. The story will take in. Great movie with\u000afantastic performances by Morgan Freeman and Tim Robbins..This kind of movie will get you off the hook at first, But it's an\u000aacquired taste that you will receive half way through.\u000a

Almost all people\u000awho watched The Shawshank Redemption said this movie is good, and\u000aconsidered as the best movie all the time, so I watched it.The story is about a man who named Andy Dufresne, a banker is convicted\u000aof murdering his wife and her lover and sentenced to two consecutive\u000alife sentences at the fictional Shawshank State Penitentiary in the\u000astate of Maine. He befriends contraband smuggler Ellis "Red" Redding,\u000aan inmate serving a life sentence. Spend over 20 years of his life in\u000aShawshank prison and finally he was able to escape from Shawshank\u000aprison.I think this movie is interesting enough that always on top in movie\u000aranking. I like this kind of drama movie and it is tear jerking story.\u000aPersonally I do not like the movie has too much violence, shouting, or\u000ayelling. In the beginning I was bored and do not want to continue to\u000awatch because there was a scene that Hadley and other prison guards\u000apunch and kick until a new prisoner die. Also there are so many scenes\u000athat similar to this scene. Those things are what I do not like. Over\u000aall, I like this movie.\u000a

V\u000aThe Shawshank Redemption is a movie involving story about life in\u000aprison that represents through crimes, bribery, sexual harassment, and\u000adrama. This movie was simple but it delivers meaningful messages in all\u000acharacters' performance especially in the scene when their eyes\u000acontact. This film contains emotional impact about true friendship and\u000ahope. Brief the plot: Andy, a successful banker, was accused of\u000amurdering his wife and her affair. He was sentenced to Shawshank Prison\u000afor that. Later in prison, Andy helped one of the prison guards to\u000aevade taxes. In return, the prison guard gave Andy and Red, his best\u000afriend in Prison, some cold beer. From this cause, Andy became a\u000apopular guy in the prison and made a lot of friends. After several\u000ayears of slowly piercing through the wall using some kind of art\u000aequipment, Andy finally broke out of prison. A couple of years later,\u000aRed was released out of Shawshank Prison. He came to meet Andy at the\u000abeach that Andy told him to meet up when he get released. The highlight\u000aof this movie is when Andy used his specialty in evading taxes to make\u000athe wardens trust him. The biggest surprise for me is when Andy asked\u000athe warden for rope, most of the people who watch will predict that he\u000awill commit suicide but the truth is, he used to it tight things up and\u000aescape from the prison. In conclusion, the acting in this movie is very\u000agood, the storytelling is amazing, exciting and brilliant, and\u000aproduction is quite simply. This movie is very amazing because it\u000ateaches me that people must always have hope to move on in their life.\u000a

V\u000aWhile maintaining some of the poetic and moving dialogue of the\u000anovella, Darabont also proves that a film's score can generate a great\u000adeal of emotional response from its audience, as dialogue does. He\u000aemploys the cunning Thomas Newman, son of the legendary Hollywood\u000acomposer, Alfred Newman. Darabont shows recognition for the film's\u000aneeds by employing Newman, who makes the gentle piano chords whisper\u000asoftly to the viewer, as if a part of the scripted dialogue. Newman\u000alends himself to individualism and tends to drive more towards the\u000aunique in the realm of score composition. His effort in Shawshank did\u000anot go unnoticed, as his score received an Oscar nomination in 1995.\u000aWhile unique and independent, Newman's score never once intrudes on\u000ayour concentration or distracts from the film.\u000a

V\u000aCurrently I am studying Film Critics at university and I was suggest to\u000awatch and write a review on The Shawshrank Redemption. The film is\u000aabout Andy told by Red, Andy's good friend at the prison called\u000a"Shawshrank". I must say that I'm pretty positive about this movie at\u000athe beginning because of Morgan Freeman. My expectation wasn't fail but\u000ai felt a little bored at the end. However, i thought the plot was going\u000ato be more complicated than this. The movie gives a lot of survival\u000afeeling though which makes me quite into the movie. Besides, the whole\u000aplot was very touching especially for the scene that Brook commit\u000asuicide. It seems like the guys who went in there can never find\u000ahappiness when they came out. I believe this movie gives out motivation\u000ato be strong and really learn what living is really. It shows mood\u000aincredibly well for the depressed part but sometimes I find the story\u000agoes very slowly so I get bored.\u000a

V\u000aFirst off, films REALLY DO have the tendency to be overrated or\u000aunderrated these days. And this film is no exception. Simple fact, I'm\u000anot a fan at all of Stephen King or his work, or the films that are\u000aBASED off his work. Just too dark, too controversial, too creepy, too\u000ahorrendous, too controversial, and too uncomfortable to sit through.Is this really one of the 10 best films of all time? Shawshank is not a\u000adownright bad movie but it has some severe flaws and I have no clue how\u000aeveryone chooses to overlook them. The problem I have with it is how it\u000aabsolutely oversimplifies everything. Shawshank for the most part\u000afocuses on exploring the idea of "Hope" (one of the most overused ideas\u000ain any prison movie), but in order to do so, it treats everything as\u000ablack or white with no middle ground. I will say that "The Shawshank\u000aRedemption" is not an "awful" film. This isn't a poorly made film with\u000amore crude humor than storyline. One of the positives of the film lies\u000ain the IMAGERY. The shot of all the prisoners in the prison yard\u000alooking up to the heavens as music plays is an amazing shot, one of the\u000amost memorable shots I've ever seen.Shawshank was really hard to watch; with all the violence and swearing,\u000aI don't think it does the story justice. I understand this film was\u000anominated for Best Picture, and I've heard people whine, left and\u000aright, that Forrest Gump did, and Shawshank didn't. Well, the way I see\u000ait, I really don't mind. I don't like how this film seems to use the\u000aname of God, or Jesus, as a bad thing, used by the world's biggest\u000ahypocrites in Shawshank (ie. the Warden); it's one of the reasons why I\u000alike Forrest Gump better so much; there isn't much violence, hardly any\u000aswearing, and even treats & talks the name of the Lord in a good way.The villain of the film, Warden Norton, is an incredibly cartoonish,\u000atwo dimensional bad guy. He and Cal from Titanic could have a\u000a"pure-evil-for-the-sake-of-being-pure-evil" standoff. Aside from greed,\u000awe have no idea what made him who he was.I see that actors William Sadler and Jeffrey DeMunn are well known for\u000abeing in this flick, though a much better film that they both star in\u000ais "Rocketman" (1997), a wild, slap-happy family-friendly comedy.\u000aPlease do check it out sometime!! And I don't even like hearing Morgan\u000aFreeman curse at all. "Driving Miss Daisy" is a much better performance\u000aof his, and is a great way for people to be introduced to him, growing\u000aup (or maybe even "Evan Almighty" is a good one, too). Tim Robbins, I\u000aguess was okay. Though he was also bizarrely in "Howard the Duck"; it\u000adoesn't have anything to do with it, I know - it's queer to see how far\u000ahe's come. And it sure is strange the head guard, who is often so prone\u000ato violence & swearing is the one who voiced Mr. Krabs in Spongebob\u000aSquarepants. Ar-Ar-Ar-Ar! Though to be fair, the escape scene is really\u000awhere things get interesting, how everything comes together, and the\u000aending definitely is pretty sweet - kinda makes you wish you could see\u000athe ending go on from there.But in the end, I'm quite glad I didn't grow up with this film -\u000abecause, sadly like many others, it might have brainwashed,\u000abadly-influenced, or manipulated me to what "reality is supposed to be\u000alike" in such a subversive & biased way.I never had any friends that ever "owned" or ever "recommended" this\u000afilm, because likely they feel the same way. One other thing that subtly bothered me was, if this story takes place\u000aover 20 years in prison... why doesn't anybody seem to AGE??? What\u000ahappened to the Makeup Department??Though I don't entirely hate this film - it's got likable actors, good\u000aacting, cool character development (i guess), great camera work, decent\u000amusic, some good effort, and a feel-good ended scene - but it's really\u000aoverwhelmed by so much bad, it almost makes the good stuff non-existent\u000aor even seem "sugar-coated".IMO, Groundhog Day is a much better film worth to be nominated for\u000aOscar and even considered one of the "greatest films ever", not this\u000anor "the Godfather".5/10 PS: Want a better film from 1994??? Go watch either "Iron Will",\u000a"Angels In The Outfield," "The Jungle Book," "The Swan Princess", "A\u000aTroll In Central Park", "Speed", "The Little Rascals", "True Lies",\u000a"The Santa Clause", or even "Forrest Gump." PS 2: "Pulp Fiction" should not even have been NOMINATED that same year\u000afor a "Best Picture" Oscar, being an overrated worthless pile of\u000anothing - it should've been the Lion King nominated! Pulp Fiction can\u000ago off and die.\u000a

V\u000aShawshank Redemption  Never Give up HopeShawshank Redemption gives an insight into prison life in the 1940's\u000aand how people can become after being there for a long time. This\u000abecomes the life they come to know and they become "institutionalized".\u000aWhile in prison, life on the outside goes on. We are encouraged to have\u000ahope and to never give up.Shawshank redemption has several major characters that play in it\u000aincluding but not limited to (real name, character name)Tim Robbins  Andy DufresneMorgan Freeman  Ellis Boyd "Red" ReddingBob Gunton  Warden NortonWilliam Sadler  HeywoodJames Whitmore  Brooks HatlenClancy Brown  Captain HadleyAfter being convicted of killing his wife, Andy Defresne is to serve a\u000alife sentence and was sent to Shawshank Prison to do his time. Andy\u000aremains quiet and tries to keep to himself until he meets Red. Andy and\u000aRed become friends. Red shows Andy the ropes and helps him adjust to\u000aprison life. Red advises Andy to not let his guard down or to let\u000aothers see his weaknesses. Andy stays strong and encounters an\u000aunforgettable journey inside Shawshank Prison. Andy dreams big but\u000awonders if his dreams will ever come true. Andy learns to never give up\u000ahope and to stay strong.Themes of hope and the power of friendship can be seen throughout the\u000amovie. It seems that no matter what Andy is dealt with he keeps\u000afighting to stay on top and maintain his hope. Although the target of\u000athe "Sisters" Andy never gives up. He remains determined to keep a\u000apositive attitude despite what prison life may sent your way. Shawshank Redemption was filmed in prison. The lighting was low key\u000awhile in the prison walls and natural lighting in the prison yard. The\u000ause of lighting made it more convincing of the 1940's. Filming was done\u000aso as to be able to read expressions on the actor's faces and read into\u000atheir thoughts. This movie teaches up to never give up hope and that true friendship\u000awill always be there till the end. "Remember Red, hope is a good thing, maybe the best of things and no\u000agood thing ever dies"  Andy Dufrense\u000a

Morgan Freeman\u000anarrating, it just doesn't get better than that kids. The characters\u000apull you in and you will be engrossed in the story before you know it.\u000aTim Robbins has a performance of a lifetime. Honestly, I believe it is\u000aa crying shame that this movie didn't win any Oscars. That is because\u000ait came out the same year as Forrest Gump and people were in awe\u000abecause they had never seen anything done like Forrest Gump before.\u000aDon't get me wrong, Tom Hanks is amazing and Forrest Gump was great,\u000abut if you are looking for the true best picture of 1994 grab some\u000apopcorn, and look no further than Shawshank Redemption. If you don't\u000abelieve me look at what movie sits on top of the IMDb's Top 250 movies\u000aof all time list year in and year out.\u000a

V\u000aI took a course of film criticism and it was a requirement to watch a\u000afilm called "The Shawshank Redemption". My first thought was quite\u000anegative because it was an old movie made in 1994. However, after I\u000awatched it yesterday, it was so impressive.The Shawshank Redemption is a story about Andy Dufresne who is a banker\u000awas convicted of murdering his wife so he was caught to the fictional\u000ashaw shank stage. Things that happened in shaw shank were terrible but\u000ahe had a friend named "Red" who always supported him. Moreover, he was\u000aa genius person so he did everything he could to make things better. In\u000afact, every single thing that he has done, he did it in purpose. And\u000athat consequence was over my expectation. What I like most is the story line and the plot was perfect. I really\u000alike how the story has been laid out and it always surprised me. You\u000acannot guess what will happen next or even why the character does such\u000athings. Furthermore, I really like the main characters; Tim Robbins and\u000aMorgan Freeman, because their acts were so natural\u000a

V\u000aEvery time this film comes on the TV I end up watching it all the way\u000athrough. Even if it's on till 2am and I have got to be up early for\u000awork I stay up and watch it all the way through. I don't know what it\u000ais about it. Possibly Morgan Freeman voice hypnotising me. Or maybe I\u000ajust enjoy it. Saying that though Green Mile does the same thing to me\u000aand Morgan Freemans not in that. I'd say I have seen this film more\u000atime than the name Andy Dufrey is said throughout the film. All in all\u000aa superb film and if you have not seen it yet, i'd like to know how you\u000ahaven't with the countless amount of times it's been on the TV. Give it\u000aa watch and fall into the trap I am stuck in. (In a good way)\u000a

V\u000aTalk about your school of hard knocks. In The Shawshank Redemption\u000a(Columbia, R), Andy Dufresne (Tim Robbins), a tall, soft-spoken New\u000aEngland banker, is convicted-wrong- ly-of killing his adulterous wife\u000aand her lover. It's 1947, and Andy, having received a double life\u000asentence, is shipped off to Shawshank State Prison in Maine, a\u000amaximum-security fortress packed to the grimy gills with thieves,\u000arapists, and murderers. How bad is life at Shawshank? So bad that when\u000aAndy trudges off the bus along with a dozen other new inmates, the\u000aveteran prisoners make wagers on who'll be the first to cry. So bad\u000athat Andy finds a huge, wriggly yellow maggot buried in his lunch. So bad that, over the next two years, he is systematically beaten and\u000araped by the Sisters, a crew of leering renegade inmates who take\u000aspecial delight in tormenting their fellow prisoners. Make no mistake:\u000aAndy gets worked over-and so does the audience. But then, good things\u000ahave a way of happening to unfortunate movie characters. Early in his\u000astay, Andy makes the acquaintance of Red (Morgan Freeman), a sly\u000asurvivor who is serving a life sentence for murder and who acts as\u000aShawshank's one-man black market, smuggling the prisoners anything they\u000awant-cigarettes, reefer, cards with naked ladies (''I'm a regular Sears\u000aand Roebuck,'' he deadpans). As soon as Andy bonds with Red, things\u000astart to ! look up. He gets hold of a rock hammer so that he can sculpt\u000aan elegant chess set. He does the guards' tax returns in exchange for\u000aperks like beer on a sunbaked afternoon. He expands the dusty,\u000aneglected book room into the most comprehensive prison library in New\u000aEngland. Set over a period of 20 years (the passing decades are marked by Andy's\u000apinup posters of Rita Hayworth, then Marilyn, then Raquel), The\u000aShawshank Redemption begins as a nightmare, a postwar- New England\u000aMidnight Express, but it doesn't take long to reveal its true,\u000afeel-good colors. The movie is about survival, triumph, and a thing\u000acalled hope. It's about a hero who rises above the squalor because he's\u000ablessed-a saint in the muck. It's Midnight Express Goes Gump. You need\u000aa certain craftsmanship to traffic in twin brands of manipulation- the\u000aexploitative and the sentimental-and there's no denying that Frank\u000aDarabont, who wrote and directed The Shawshank Redemption (it's based\u000aon a short novel by Stephen King), knows just what he's doing. The\u000amoss-dark, saturated images have a redolent sensuality; you feel as if\u000ayou could reach out and touch the prison walls. And Darabont is an\u000aaccomplished button pusher. He coaches the actors so that you always\u000aknow exactly who to root for and against. When it comes to a character\u000alike the warden (Bob Gunton), all Bible- thumping righteousness, the\u000amovie has no compunction about turning up the hissability factor. He\u000astarts out mean, then turns meaner, then meaner still. When Andy blasts\u000aMozart's The Marriage of Figaro over loudspeakers to the prison work\u000afield, it becomes a full-scale opera-soothes-the-savage-breast number,\u000awith the prisoners standing open-mouthed at the sublime sounds. The\u000ascene is meant to fire our righteous liberal hearts. It helps, of\u000acourse, that most of the prisoners don't actually behave like\u000acriminals. They never say a word about their pasts-even Andy remains a downtrodden\u000acipher-and this lends the proceedings a hollow, generic feel, as if\u000aDarabont had constructed a blueprint out of old prison melodramas. A\u000amovie like The Shawshank Redemption, with its brazenly mechanical\u000aplotting and its wish-fulfillment finale, requires a lead actor who can\u000acarry us on the wings of his good spirits. Tim Robbins is crafty and\u000alikable when Andy is hoodwinking the guards, and he makes you feel the\u000acharacter's mute anguish. Yet in shouldering what is essentially a\u000alaconic- good-guy, neo-Gary Cooper role, Robbins never quite makes\u000aemotional contact with the audience. His face, foggy and placid,\u000asuggests an overgrown baby's; there's something naggingly unformed\u000aabout him. Morgan Freeman, on the other hand, with his delicate\u000asmolder, his eyes that seem to peer directly into everyone's soul,\u000amakes Red feel genuine, lived-in. Speaking of the prison walls, he\u000asays, ''First you hate 'em. Then you get used to 'em. After long enough, you get so you depend on\u000a'em. That's institutionalized.'' With his gift for rapt pauses, for\u000acaressing just the right syllable, Freeman can make a speech like that\u000asound like one of the philosophical nuggets of the ages. Then again,\u000aisn't it time Morgan Freeman stopped playing the soulful sidekick?\u000aWhile we're on the subject of prison walls, an actor as great as he is\u000ashouldn't get too used to movies like this one.\u000a

V\u000aPart of that probably comes from the concept of tolerance, hope to\u000abring freedom. It was answered clearly for Andy who does not make\u000amistakes But patience to stay inside jail Doing what he loves, offering\u000ahope, goodness and kindness to others. (Proposed channels of tax\u000aevasion for the atrocities against their jailers, like beer,\u000acolleagues, by himself, does not touch alcohol, etc.) say it is my view\u000athat the Andy is in jail without fault.

V\u000aThe Shawshank Redemption is a movie about time, patience and loyalty.\u000aThe partnership between the characters played by Tim Robbins and Morgan\u000aFreeman is crucial to the way the story unfolds. This is not a "prison\u000adrama" in any conventional sense of the word. It is not about violence,\u000ariots or melodrama. The word "redemption" is in the title for a reason.\u000aThe movie is quite unlike most of King's work. The horror here is not\u000aof the supernatural kind, but of the sort that flows from the\u000arealization than 10, 20, 30 years of a man's life have unreeled in the\u000asame unchanging daily prison routine. "The Shawshank Redemption" is not\u000aa depressing story, although I may have made it sound that way. There\u000ais a lot of life and humor in it, and warmth in the friendship that\u000abuilds up between Andy and Red. There is even excitement and suspense,\u000aalthough not when we expect it. But mostly the film is an allegory\u000aabout holding onto a sense of personal worth, despite everything. If\u000athe film is perhaps a little slow in its middle passages, maybe that is\u000apart of the idea, too, to give us a sense of the leaden passage of\u000atime, before the glory of the final redemption.\u000a

V\u000aCan Hollywood, usually creating things for entertainment purposes only,\u000acreate art? To create something of this nature, a director must\u000aapproach it in a most meticulous manner, due to the delicacy of the\u000aprocess. Such a daunting task requires an extremely capable artist with\u000aan undeniable managerial capacity and an acutely developed awareness of\u000aeach element of art in their films, the most prominent; music, visuals,\u000ascript, and acting. These elements, each equally important, must\u000asucceed independently, yet still form a harmonious union, because this\u000amixture determines the fate of the artist's opus. Though already well\u000aknown amongst his colleagues for his notable skills at writing and\u000adirecting, Frank Darabont emerges with his feature film directorial\u000adebut, The Shawshank Redemption. Proving himself already a master of\u000athe craft, Darabont managed to create one of the most recognizable\u000aindependent releases in the history of Hollywood. The Shawshank\u000aRedemption defines a genre, defies the odds, compels the emotions, and\u000abrings an era of artistically influential films back to Hollywood.The story begins with the trial of a young banker, Andy Dufrense,\u000avictimized by circumstantial evidence, resulting in a conviction for\u000athe murder of his wife and her lover. After a quick conviction, Andy\u000afinds himself serving a life sentence at Shawshank prison, with no hope\u000aof parole. He exists in this prison only in appearance, keeping his\u000amind free from the drab walls around him. His ability to do this\u000aresults in the gaining of respect from his fellow inmates, but most of\u000aall from Ellis Redding. Ellis, commonly referred to as Red, finds\u000againful use of his entrepreneurial spirit within the drab walls of\u000aShawshank by dealing in contraband and commodities rare to the confines\u000aof prison. Andy's demeanor and undeniable sense of hope causes Red to\u000atake a deeper look at himself, and the world around him. Andy proves to\u000aRed and the other inmates that in the conventional walls of Shawshank\u000aprison convention will find no home in his lifestyle.By creating the film's firm foundation, the meticulously chiseled\u000ascreenplay paved the way for this film's success. Frank Darabont\u000aoutdoes himself with the phenomenal adaptation of Stephen King's\u000aequally noteworthy novella, Rita Hayworth and Shawshank Redemption. In\u000athis novella, King demonstrates that he can break free from the genre\u000ahe dominates and still create a marvelous piece of modern literature.\u000aThough the film mirrors the novella in many ways, Darabont illustrates\u000aa focused objective of improving upon the areas where the novella came\u000aup short, resulting in one of the best book to film transitions ever.While maintaining some of the poetic and moving dialog of the novella,\u000aDarabont also proves that a film's score can generate a great deal of\u000aemotional response from its audience, as dialog does. He employs the\u000acunning Thomas Newman, son of the legendary Hollywood composer, Alfred\u000aNewman. Darabont shows recognition for the film's needs by employing\u000aNewman, who makes the gentle piano chords whisper softly to the viewer,\u000aas if a part of the scripted dialog. Newman lends himself to\u000aindividualism and tends to drive more towards the unique in the realm\u000aof score composition. His effort in Shawshank did not go unnoticed, as\u000ahis score received an Oscar nomination in 1995. While unique and\u000aindependent, Newman's score never once intrudes on your concentration\u000aor distracts from the film.With work from vast array of talented scene designers, costume\u000adesigners, composers, cinematographers, and various other Hollywood\u000aartists, the cast of The Shawshank Redemption had a strong foundation\u000ato work with. The marvelous cast of this film will dazzle you with some\u000aof the most convincing performances you will witness in a film. While\u000aboth Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman shine as Andy and Red,\u000arespectively, the true spectacle of acting lies within the plethora of\u000aamazing supporting actors who easily disappear into their roles. Most\u000anoticeable of these, the veteran film star James Whitmore, who portrays\u000athe elderly Brooks Hatlen. Brooks, a man incarcerated for an\u000aunmentioned crime for so long that he finds himself attached to the\u000aShawshank and the daily life he has lead. Each of these actors show a\u000atrue dedication to their art, and a focused purpose in their\u000amotivations, creating a convincing setting that never once caters to\u000aanything unbelievable.With all of the aesthetic touches and attention to cinematic detail,\u000athe most beautiful part of the film lies within its thematic material,\u000asuch as its focus on the human desires for the most abstract concepts,\u000alike hope and freedom. These themes, which concern things the human\u000aspirit undoubtedly yearns for, seem so intricately woven into the plot\u000athat it easily draws its audience in to its story. Though full of\u000ahardened criminals, your heart will go out to these men as they display\u000athe most basic of human emotions, and deliver some of the most quotable\u000alines in a film to date. Like a great novel, this film manages to\u000asucceed at greater things than simply entertaining an audience.\u000aDarabont tells his story most masterfully, illustrating principles and\u000ainspiring his audience to think. He leaves us a poignant film with a\u000apowerful message of hope, and redemption, something we all seek.Darabont shows us that artists still work in the Hollywood studios and\u000aproduction facilities. These artists show their capability to produce\u000aart; real art that inspires you to look at the deeper aspects of life\u000aand the world around you. The Shawshank Redemption delivers much-\u000aneeded breath of fresh air for anyone who realizes the capability of\u000afilm. It proves that masters of the craft still live on this earth, and\u000astill bless us with timeless masterpieces that we will never forget.\u000a

V\u000aI had a chance to check the list of movie top 250 and this film is on\u000athe top of the list with high ratings.It's about man who got arrest cause convicted of murder his own wife.\u000aHe got a life imprison that had change his whole life. He struggles\u000awith living and dealing with new life. He started to adjust himself\u000awith other especially with one who turns out to be his friend.I admire the way that film represents life deeply and give various\u000adimensions. I saw main character thinking contradict with other. It\u000adoes show violence and rude of life but give good thought.In my opinion, after I watched this film. I have no doubt why it's on\u000athe top list. It gives lot of thought and show various dimension of\u000alife.\u000a

V\u000aOne of my all time favorites. Shawshank Redemption is a very moving\u000astory about hope and the power of friendship. The cast is first rate\u000awith everyone giving a great performance. Tim Robbins and Morgan\u000aFreeman carry the movie, but Bob Gunton and Clancy Brown are perfect as\u000athe Warden Norton and prison guard captain Hadley respectively. And\u000aJames Whitmore's portrayal of an elderly inmate Brooks is moving. The\u000ascreenplay gives almost every actor at least one or more memorable\u000alines through out the film. As well as a very surprising "twist" near\u000athe end that almost knocked me out of my chair. If you have not seen\u000athis movie rent it or better yet buy it. As I bet you'll want to see\u000athis one more than once.\u000a

V\u000aIt's well paced, although maybe a bit slow for impatient viewers, but\u000aevery scene is important and done very well. The score is great and\u000asets a nice tone in correlation with each scene. There are two things,\u000ahowever, that make Shawshank really stand out. The first being the\u000acharacters, they're well developed and all believable and all likable,\u000awhich is fitting as the story is told mainly through the perspective of\u000aMorgan Freeman's character, and it's made all the better by the fact\u000athat every single actor puts on a nearly flawless performance, and not\u000aone of them left us doubting that they were a very real person. The\u000asecond way in which Shawshank really stands out, and exceeds as much as\u000aany movie ever has, is the order in which the events are shown and how\u000athey are presented. We see the story before us, sometimes hearing it\u000afrom Morgan freeman, sometimes we learn about a characters past,\u000asometimes we learn about their more or less significant philosophies,\u000awe learn about many characters and not one seems out of place or\u000apointless, and each is introduced in no manner short of perfection, and\u000ain it's way we are left only to wonder how their story will progress in\u000athe film, and we frequently end up surprised. And in the end, Shawshank\u000acomes together with a vast number of things to appreciate, and it's an\u000aultimately powerful film when everything comes together in especially\u000abeautiful fashion in the final scenes.\u000a

V\u000aThis movie is not your ordinary Hollywood flick. It has a great and\u000adeep message. This movie has a foundation and just kept on being built\u000aon from their and that foundation is hope.Other than just the message of this movie the acting was phenomenal.\u000aTim Robbins gave one of the greatest performances ever. He was\u000ainspiring, intelligent and most of all positive. His performance just\u000amade me smile. Robbins plays Andy Dufresne who was wrongfully convicted\u000aof murdering his wife and her lover. He is gets to life sentences but\u000ayet never gives up hope. In he becomes friends with Ellis Boyd "Red"\u000aRedding played by Morgan Freeman. Freeman who gives the finest\u000aperformance of his career has unlike Robbins lost hope. He is in deep\u000aregret of the crime that he committed. His way of deflecting the pain\u000aaway is by trying to not feel anything at all. With his friendship with\u000aAndy he learns that without our hopes and dreams we have nothing. Andy\u000aalso becomes friends with the rest of Red's group. James Whitmore also\u000agave a great performance as Brooks Halten who gets out of prison parole\u000abut in the words of Red he has been "institutionalized". The directing by Frank Darabont was just magnificent. He kept this\u000amovie at a great steady pace along with the writing and great\u000acinematography. He portrayed prison life in such a horrifying way, but\u000anot in terms of the physical pain but the stress and pain that wares\u000amentally on the inmates, some of which deserve a second chance.\u000a

V\u000aThis movie deserves 10/10. And yeah you can can say that there are so\u000amany things that help you cut down its rating as left most cell for\u000aAndy(A hotshot banker on whom this movie is pictured) or Bogs only\u000adicks with Andy, so what it is still a MOVIE based on novel of Stephan\u000aking. Its just that its an "EPIC MOVIE". The narration by Morgan\u000afreeman is remarkable, it feels like someone is whispering in your\u000aears, when this movie reaches it mid you starts to adore the relation\u000abetween Andy and red. and that night Andy finally redeem himself from\u000aprison, that Rita Haywood poster, that chess board and everything, you\u000astarts to love when detailed by red. this movie also has a cliché in\u000awhich Andy makes himself rich which you want to see and how he keeps\u000ahis mind occupied and what they think about him. "Some birds are not\u000ameant to be caged, Their feathers are just too bright".\u000a

As the same as other review I was\u000amoved by this film, this movie affects me strongly that even I watch it\u000aover and over again. I've always have the impression of the first time\u000aseen.The best thing is you have to prepare to be moved by the hopes that\u000aemerged in this story, no special effects or tricks. This is just plain\u000asimple and impressive by its owns way portraits the very common life of\u000amen. In such despair , its amazing that when you watch this movie you\u000acan taste the freedom. The strong power of hope and determination will\u000ablow your mind.So no doubt this is the best film I've ever seen, as far as my concern\u000athere is no minor things that will stop me from rating it 10.\u000a

V\u000aI am 22; And I was craving a well plotted movie the other day. And\u000aquite frankly I was quite bored of fantasy movies. I wanted to watch\u000asomething that had to do with the system. I decided to go through the\u000alist of top movies of all times, according to IMDb. The Shawshank\u000aRedemption was ranked number one based on popularity. I watched the\u000atrailer and I immediately fell in love with the fact that it was\u000anarrated by Morgan Freeman and that it was about the prison system in\u000athe previous century. The movie The Shawshank Redemption Is about a\u000acharacter named Andy Dufresne, an introverted,young,successful banker.\u000aIn 1947, one fine morning, Andy finds himself guilty of a crime that he\u000arepeated says he didn't commit. However, the evidence says otherwise.\u000aThey charge him for murdering his wife and her lover. Double life\u000asentence. He soon finds himself in one of the harshest prison in the\u000acountry. There he meets Red and his friends. Andy takes his time but\u000aslowly, tactically, befriends them. Andy's wide range of skills helps\u000ahim get on good terms with the prison guards, and even the Prison\u000aWarden. The Warden soon finds Andy so useful that he starts making Andy\u000ahelp him with his bank statements, allowing him to launder money\u000awithout any suspicion.Soon Tommy Williams enters the picture, and what\u000ahe discloses changes everything. The movie was very well directed.\u000aHowever, I wish the story focused a little more on how Andy manages to\u000acreate a false identity. Overall, the movie was very interesting. I\u000aloved how they portrayed all the inmates and their problems. I very\u000amuch appreciated the fact that they didn't show the prison rapes in\u000adetails, and left most of it to the imagination. Andy's unreadable\u000acharacteristics were very well played by the actor Tim Robbins.\u000aThroughout the whole time, I simply couldn't figure out whether he was\u000areally innocent or not, until Tommy Williams enters the picture. Andy's\u000aand Red's friendship develops very realistically. The little jokes they\u000ashare were very amusing, especially the first time they talk, when Andy\u000aasks Red why his name is Red. The villainous Warden's character was\u000avery unpredictable. His "Strict Christian" image was brilliant. It made\u000ait seem that he might have a little bit of goodness inside, but as the\u000astory unveils, he turns out to be pure evil. The movie overall was\u000aintriguing. It does show some real issues that inmates go through-\u000adiscrimination, sexual frustration, institutionalization and all forms\u000aof abuse. I think the movie is very eye opening. I think the message it\u000awants to send out is that one should get to know the system and how it\u000aworks so that when the system turns abusive, one can do something about\u000ait.\u000a

V\u000aThis film really impressed. We can feel the friendship between Red and\u000aAndy. They start from stranger to become a best friend. Even they are\u000anot contact for many years but friendship doesn't gone. I really\u000asurprise in the middle of movie that Andy is innocent, because from the\u000abeginning at movie, the first day in prison. He look not fear in the\u000aprison. In addition, he really intelligence and no one know his plan\u000afor escape the prison. In this movie we see difference between Brooks\u000aand Red, they are out from prison when they get older but they choose\u000ain different way. It like Andy told Red "get busy watching or get busy\u000adying".\u000a

V\u000aThe Shawshank Redemption is a Prison tricky film. The prison itself\u000abecomes a metaphor for the society, or even to retard people from being\u000acompletely free instead.Tim Robbins as Andy Dufresne, an intelligent banker convicted of\u000akilling his wife and her lover is wrongly sent to Shawshank Prison. The\u000afirst and best friend that he makes is Red, the elder statesman of the\u000ayard, played by Morgan Freeman, the one that obviously a great actor\u000awho never ever did wrong in his career.At Shawshank, they communicating us about how to survive in here, and\u000awhat you need to maintain a stage of humanity, which literally reflect\u000aus about reality of life. The warden, sexually abused by inmates and\u000aeven beaten by guards harasses Andy. Sooner or later, Andy gets used to\u000ahis new living arrangement which someone called home, but still has\u000ahope that he will leave Shawshank. As well as he try to reminds others\u000ato be hopeful.Shawshank Redemption is not to reform you, but totally drive you crazy.\u000aIt's not just a film for entertainment; it's educating us about what\u000alife really is. Even though the film offers us a prison and corruption,\u000ait's definitely warmth my heart and so do you.\u000a

V\u000aI am aware that by now almost everyone knows the plot of this film, but\u000asince this is my first reviewed title on IMDb, I'll do my part in\u000aexplaining it."The Shawshank Redemption" is based on the Stephen King's short story\u000a"Rita Hayworth and the Shawshank Redemption". Set in New England, the\u000afilm tells the story of a young banker named Andy Dufresne (played by\u000aTim Robbins), who is wrongfully convicted of murdering his wife and her\u000alover. In prison he befriends Ellis Boyd Redding (Morgan Freeman),\u000anicknamed "Red" by his friends, and his gang. But he also catches the\u000aeyes of "The Sisters", a gang of rapists and bullies led by Bogs (Mark\u000aRolston). He then must make up his escape plan, while aiding the guards\u000aand most importantly the warden (Bob Gunton) to cheat on their taxes.I was deeply impressed by this film since the first time I watched it,\u000aand has remained my favorite film ever since. All of the main actors\u000aplay their parts beautifully (Freeman in particular), and the ending is\u000athe most powerful I have ever seen.A must-see for everyone.\u000a

V\u000aThis subtitle might sound a little cheesy, but in fact the movie\u000apresents us with a story of having to cope with a harsh reality, and in\u000athe end, managing to move on from it. The Shawshank Redemption always\u000agives to me the feeling that it is separated between two very different\u000aacts. Although this separation isn't balanced in the runtime, it is, in\u000aa way, the manner in which the film is constructed.At the beginning, we are introduced to Andy Dufresne (Robbins), a man\u000aaccused of murdering his wife and her lover. He is sent to Shawshank\u000aPrison for life, and there he meets Red (Freeman), the man who can get\u000ayou anything you want. Over the years, Andy will become good friends\u000awith Red, be brutally abused by a group of aggressive homosexuals, and\u000aparticipate in a series of scams orchestrated by the warden. All the\u000atime Andy spends in incarceration seems like a living hell, thus\u000asetting up the dark, absorbing environment of most of the movie's\u000aruntime. By the time we get to the last part of the film, we see a\u000apleasant payoff that presents itself in a different tone, one that\u000awhile sometimes present in the movie's gritty prison setting, lashes\u000aout fully in the last few scenes.Directed masterfully by Frank Darabont, and with career defining\u000aperformances from Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman, Shawshank lives on as\u000aa cinematic landmark. It's a movie that captures the essence of good\u000astorytelling and lives up to its legacy through that, while also being\u000aa competently made film, with a diverse soundtrack and a beautifully\u000aplanned production design.For me, The Shawshank Redemption represents assuming responsibility and\u000acoming to terms with a complicated situation, while also having the\u000astrenght to triumph over adversity. As Andy says, hope is what keeps a\u000aman mentally stable and in my estimation the most powerful feeling in a\u000amovie like this.Rating 10/10\u000a

V\u000aI know it is absolutely shocking to you that the #1 movie on IMDb's Top\u000a250 is my (and many, many others') favorite movie. Why, you may ask?\u000a(and I would respond with a quizzical look and say what do you mean\u000awhy?) Because it is simply perfection in every facet of the film making\u000aprocess. The direction is magnificent as Darabont gets wonderful\u000aperformances from his entire cast and paced the movie perfectly. It's a\u000along film, but doesn't feel that way. Darabont of course also gets\u000acredit as the writer, and the writing is masterful. There are so many\u000amemorable lines. The cast is amazing and the performance by Morgan\u000aFreeman and Tim Robbins are unforgettable. God I love this movie. The end scene makes me shed a tear every time.\u000a

V\u000a.....and Ironically, it most certainly does.Bank Merchant Andy Defrene is convicted of the murder of his wife and\u000aher lover, and sentenced to life imprisonment at the titular prison. Life seems to begin to fade, but fortunately Andy befriends some of the\u000aother inmates, in particular a character known only as Red. Over time Andy finds ways to live out life with relative ease as one\u000acan expect in a prison, his body may be locked away in a cell, but his\u000aspirit can never be truly imprisoned.....There is nothing to say about this film that hasn't been said before.\u000aIts awe-inspiring, its warm, and most of all, it gives you an enormous\u000asense of well being once the credits roll.From the opening shot of the prison, to the iconic Christ like pose in\u000athe rain, the film is chock full of religious allegory, and references\u000athe bible in several key scenes. But the film demands repeat viewings,\u000abecause there is so much subliminal imagery and messages in the film.The acting is brilliant, and the warmth between Andy and Red is the\u000aheart of the film, and the chemistry between Freeman and Robbins is\u000asecond to none.Its a perfectly crafted film, with effortless narrative, and it will\u000amake you smile and cry in equal measures.Yes, it should have ended when Freeman got on the bus, but nothing is\u000atoo perfect is it?\u000a

V\u000aOther than just the message of this movie the acting was phenomenal.\u000aTim Robbins gave one of the greatest performances ever. He was\u000ainspiring, intelligent and most of all positive. His performance just\u000amade me smile. Robbins plays Andy Dufresne who was wrongfully convicted\u000aof murdering his wife and her lover. He is gets to life sentences but\u000ayet never gives up hope. In he becomes friends with Ellis Boyd "Red"\u000aRedding played by Morgan Freeman. Freeman who gives the finest\u000aperformance of his career has unlike Robbins lost hope. He is in deep\u000aregret of the crime that he committed. His way of deflecting the pain\u000aaway is by trying to not feel anything at all. With his friendship with\u000aAndy he learns that without our hopes and dreams we have nothing. Andy\u000aalso becomes friends with the rest of Red's group. James Whitmore also\u000agave a great performance as Brooks Halten who gets out of prison parole\u000abut in the words of Red he has been "institutionalized".\u000a

V\u000aThis film portrays hope, justice and friendship in the most elegant of\u000aways; mixed in with the prison life makes for a journey that inspires\u000amany never to give up and remember hope is always an option.The personality of Andy Dufresne mixed with prison life is calming at\u000atimes and also simple yet it leaves a feeling of joy and happiness when\u000atime comes, the opposite of the feeling at the start, which would make\u000aanyone doubt the justice of the act.The impact of Morgan Freeman lets us see a more in-depth side to Andy\u000aDufrense even though they have great differences between them creating\u000aa everlasting friendship.This movie is set apart from others as it shows us the realistic view\u000aof a prison in the 1940/50's and the affect it has on its inhabitants.\u000a

V\u000aThe Shawshank redemption is an excellent movie that was executed\u000aperfectly. Based off of the Stephen King novella Rita Hayworth and\u000aShawshank Redemption, the movie did an exceptional job of recreating\u000athe story. The Shawshank Redemption is a top class movie that needs to\u000abe seen by anyone and everyone with the perfect features to make it\u000astand out in the crowd of movies.The acting in the movie The Shawshank Redemption is one of the main\u000areasons that the movie turned out to be so wonderful. Combining the\u000askills of Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman proved to be a pair for the\u000aages. With two characters, one quiet, reserved character and one\u000apopular, outspoken character, both played by actors with similar\u000apersonalities. Appreciation was shown for the acting in this movie when\u000aMorgan Freeman was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Actor in a\u000aLeading Role (Academy Awards 1995). Although he lost, it is still\u000aimpressive considering he lost to Tom Hanks in Forrest Gump/ These two\u000aactors were not the only actors vital to the production of this movie.\u000aEach individual side character was played by an actor perfect for the\u000apart. No actor could have done justice to any of the characters like\u000athe actors who starred in the film did.The story of the movie was possibly one of the best told stories of all\u000atime. Although it is a recent story when compared with stories from all\u000atime, it does the perfect job of immersing you in the lives and\u000afeelings of the characters and of keeping you hooked on what happens\u000anext the whole time. Stephen King started off by writing this\u000amasterpiece of a story in his novella and Frank Darabont worked with\u000athis masterpiece and wrote and directed one of the top one hundred\u000amovies of all time (AFI Top 100). The story is told over a just longer\u000athan two hour movie, that does not go on too long or too short. After\u000athe viewer has finished watching the movie, they are perfectly\u000asatisfied.The Shawshank Redemption has a Motion Picture Association of America\u000arating of R, or restricted. This rating should be lowered too PG-13,\u000aknown as Parents Strongly Cautioned. Although the movie does have\u000aslight hints at sexual activity and scenes with murders and suicide,\u000athis does not outweigh the benefit of people seeing this movie. No\u000aperson of the age above thirteen, or maybe even lower, should be denied\u000athe right to view this movie. The Shawshank Redemption has the\u000apotential to have an enormous effect on the lives of those who view it.\u000aAnd even if it does not impact their lives, it still could easily\u000achange their perception of a good movie or just be an enjoyable two\u000ahours of their lives. Without such heavy restrictions on the age of\u000athose who can view the movie, maybe it could have a chance to be more\u000awidely viewed, and ultimately more widely appreciated.The AFI Rating of The Shawshank Redemption shows it ranked as the\u000anumber seventy two American movie of the past one hundred years (AFI\u000aTop 100). I strongly disagree with this rating. The Shawshank\u000aRedemption, although it didn't cause any revelations in the movie world\u000a(mostly because it was too recent to have done so), is one of the best\u000afilmed movies of all time. I personally would rate The Shawshank\u000aRedemption in the top ten of all movies, and number one on my own\u000apersonal list. The less official Internet Movie Database ranking of\u000amovies has The Shawshank Redemption as the number one movie of all time\u000a(IMDB Top 250). This is a much more agreeable rating for my own opinion\u000aon the movie. Having seen five of the top ten movies on AFI's renowned\u000alist, I do not believe any of them compare to the quality and\u000aentertainment value of The Shawshank Redemption. Although I earlier\u000aagreed with AFI's rating of The Shawshank Redemption in the top one\u000ahundred, I believe it should be much higher than the ranking they\u000adecided on.Overall, the Shawshank Redemption is a movie that will go down in\u000ahistory as one of the best movies ever created. This future historical\u000arelevance is not an exaggeration. If anything, The Shawshank Redemption\u000ais an underrated movie. It's not too often that there comes a movie\u000athat is as well made as The Shawshank Redemption, so when one is, it is\u000aimportant to fully appreciate it. The Shawshank Redemption is a grade A\u000amovie made up of the perfect components of story and acting which come\u000atogether to make one of the best movies of all time.\u000a

The Director did a\u000amarvelous job with this film, the cinematography is amazing, along with\u000aa talented cast it's a hard one to beat (well Green Mile does but\u000athat's another review)I have read the negative comments and all I can\u000asay to that is (as a film maker myself)well is that not the magic of\u000acinema? Nothing created for the cinema as fiction is ever real to life\u000aor it wouldn't be called a movie but a documentary but that's my\u000aopinion.I think the story is both captivating and well told on the screen and\u000ait doesn't get the credit it deserves.\u000a

V\u000aTwo imprisoned men bond over a number of years, finding solace and\u000aeventual redemption through acts of common decency. Andy Dufresne,\u000aplayed by Tim Robbins, is a young and successful banker whose life\u000achanges drastically when he is convicted and sentenced to life\u000aimprisonment for the murder of his wife and her lover. Set in the\u000a1940's, the film shows how Andy, with the help of his friend Red,\u000aplayed by Morgan Freeman is the prison entrepreneur, turns out to be a\u000amost unconventional prisoner. The Shawshank Redemption is just a\u000abrilliant, brilliant masterpiece of modern cinema, what makes The\u000aShawshank Redemption so endearing is that it involves a strong\u000afriendship over a number of years between Andy and Red. It really is a\u000alife-affirming and inspirational film. What can I say that hasn't been\u000asaid already about this film? Only that it is the closet to perfection\u000athat a film will ever come. It really is the model and benchmark to\u000awhich other films will be compared, nothing will ever surpass it.\u000a

V\u000aMisery and Stand By Me were the best adaptations up until this one, now\u000ayou can add Shawshank to that list.This is simply one of the best films ever made and I know I am not the\u000afirst to say that and I certainly won't be the last. The standing on\u000athe IMDb is a true barometer of that. #3 as of this date and I'm sure\u000ait could be number 1. So I'll just skip all the normal praise of the\u000afilm because we all know how great it is. But let me perhaps add that\u000awhat I find so fascinating about Shawshank is that Stephen King wrote\u000ait.King is one of the best writers in the world. Books like IT and the\u000aCastle Rock series are some of the greatest stories ever told. But his\u000abest adaptations are always done by the best directors. The Shining was\u000abrilliantly interpreted by Kubrick and of course the aforementioned\u000aMisery and Stand By Me are both by Rob Reiner. Now Frank Darabont comes\u000aonto the scene and makes arguably the best King film ever. He seems to\u000aunderstand what King wants to say and he conveys that beautifully.\u000a

V\u000aThis is not a movie to be watched just for the heck of it. You can't\u000ajust stumble upon it as you can when looking for an action or comedy\u000amovie. Not to say that it can't happen, but if you're going to watch\u000athis movie, you have to focus on it and watch it all the way through\u000awithin a week. I don't know if it is a good representation of modern\u000aprisons or prisons from the time it takes place, but regardless of\u000athat, you feel for the two protagonists. I found the predicament of\u000aAndy to be completely horrific and unfair (though I wish I could find a\u000abetter word to use here than "unfair"). Some people might find the\u000amessage of hope to be kind of corny, which is a view that I can\u000aunderstand but don't share and I'm a guy that finds many things to be\u000acorny. The life of the prisoners is brutal, partly because of the\u000aguards, but partly because of the conduct of the prisoners. Andy is\u000aeasy to sympathize with, but also easy to root for because of his\u000aperseverance and hope. I like Morgan Freeman's character, Red, too.\u000aThere is an air of dignity that sets him and Andy apart from the other\u000aprisoners. The one rather implausible character point that I found was\u000aAndy's selflessness. His ability to sympathize with his fellow inmates\u000aand his willingness to better their lives does not necessarily do\u000aanything to his desire for the same benefits that they reap. His motive\u000ais certainly to help his fellow inmates, but I don't feel like he would\u000aas a human just let his hard earned rewards be wasted. The one other\u000amain character is the warden, who can either be viewed as a good\u000aheartless villain or a guy that the screenwriters forced a mean\u000apersonality onto with no good reason. I'm not saying that either one is\u000atrue, it just depends on where you're coming from. I read another\u000areview that criticizes the way the warden's quoting of the bible is\u000asort of demonized and was a biased act by the producers. Personally, I\u000adisagree with that, because there are plenty of people in real life who\u000ause biblical passages and religious motives as an excuse to do bad\u000athings. One thing about his character that I didn't really understand\u000awas why he is so reluctant to let Andy go free. The story is rather\u000alike that of Mr. Holland's Opus in the sense that it is divided up by\u000athe minor characters that come and go throughout. You can see how Andy\u000aand Red make a difference in the lives of the other inmates and each\u000aother. The mystery of how Andy escapes at the end is pretty good, but\u000anot something that requires you to have remembered a lot of things from\u000aearlier to understand. For anyone considering watching it, I would\u000arecommend that you watch it alone or with someone who won't talk\u000athrough it. Also, don't watch it if you're looking for anything outside\u000aof a good or emotional story. Overall Rating: 8.9/10\u000a

And it definitely deserves the fame. this movies reminds me\u000aabout a lot things that I kinda forget in the daily life. What we are\u000aliving for? What is the value of freedom. When you have the freedom,\u000ayou won't feel anything about it. But when you lose it, freedom becomes\u000athe most important thing in your life, as important and necessary as\u000athe air.

Next thing you know\u000athe husband lands in prison and fighting to stay alive from all the\u000ainmates and prison officers. Luckily his accountancy profession saves\u000ahim and rewards him at the same time. He makes friends with RED and\u000aends up building up the library to a delux place of relaxation, reading\u000aand music playing for all the prisoners.The ending just blew my mind.You must see this film, but be warned.....it is absolutely addictive\u000aviewing.\u000a

Invoking the desperation of all of\u000aus...wondering; in this situation, how would we handle it? This film/\u000astory is definitely one of my favorites from Stephen King's book of\u000ashort stories. If you haven't taken the time to watch this you're\u000amissing out. I watch whenever I can and always feel satisfied at the\u000aend. From the music, to the attention to detail with the wardrobe, this\u000amovie is all-around a classic and should be put on your top 10 best\u000alist....today....

V\u000aSometimes, a classic can come from an unexpected source. That's the\u000acase with the Shawshank Redemption. When you only hear about the plot,\u000ayou'd guess that it may be very enjoyable, but it's been done before.\u000aThe film is about a prison break. That doesn't sound like an original\u000aidea. Shawshank Redemption is based on a Steven King novella named\u000a'Rita Hayworth and the Shawshank Redemption'. Usually, the film\u000aadaptations of Stephen King's novels aren't very strong. The picture\u000awas directed by Frank Darabont, who didn't have much of a success\u000arecord back in 1994. The two leading actors are Tim Robbins, who\u000aportrays Andy Dufresne and Morgan Freeman, who portrays Ellis Boyd\u000aRedding (simply known as 'Red'). While they are both very good actors,\u000ayou wouldn't expect them to have a perfect chemistry. The film also\u000adidn't very well in the box office upon its release. So despite all of\u000athat, this film has often been referred to as one of the best films of\u000aall time. I think that's a fair point to make. You don't expect an\u000aall-time classic going into the Shawshank Redemption, but that's\u000aexactly what you're going to get. This films sucks you in and blows you\u000aaway.Andy Dufresne is sent to Shawshank prison in 1947 because he murdered\u000ahis wife and her lover, or so we believe. He's very introvert at first\u000aand doesn't interact with any of the prisoners. That is, however, until\u000ahe asks Red if he could get Rita Hayworth to Shawshank. Red simply\u000areplies that it will take a little while, but he'll manage, since he's\u000aa man who knows how to get things. It eventually turns out to be a\u000aposter of Hayworth. When Red asks Andy why committed the crime he's\u000abeen sentenced for, Andy states he's innocent. Of course every other\u000aprisoner in Shawshank state that they are innocent, except for Red, who\u000atells Andy he's the only guilty man in the prison. Red and Andy develop\u000aa friendship over the years and the chemistry between the two is simply\u000aamazing. Andy befriends most of Red's friends, like Heywood (played by\u000aWilliam Sadler) and the old man named Brooks Hatlen (played by James\u000aWhitmore). Andy's first couple of years in Shawshank are extremely\u000adifficult. The 'sisters' have an eye on him and especially their\u000aleader, Bogs (played by Mark Rolston). They attempt to rape Andy on\u000aseveral occasions. The prison is run by the corrupted warden named\u000aSamuel Norton (played by Bob Gunton) and his chief of the guards, Byron\u000aHadley, who brutally assaults prisoners to demonstrate his power. In\u000aMay of 1949, Red and his friends are selected to tar the roof of\u000aShawshank, which keeps them outdoors for a couple of days. Andy\u000aconfronts Byron Hadley about his financial issues. This eventually\u000aleads to an improved prison live for Andy and his friends. Andy helps\u000athe prison guards with their financial situation and eventually even\u000adoes all of the wardens finances. In 1954, Brooks Hatlen is released\u000afrom Shawshank after having stayed there for 50 years. He can't live a\u000anormal live outside of the prison walls and decides to hang himself.\u000aRed clarifies that Brook has become institutionalized. After Bogs and\u000athe 'sisters' nearly beat Andy to death, Byron Hadley assaults Bogs so\u000aso hard he is never able to walk again. Andy continues to control the\u000awardens finances and explains to Red how all the 'dirty' money is\u000awashed clean. He made up a person on paper, named Randall Stevens, so\u000aall the trails lead to him, but because he's fictional, the I.R.S won't\u000abe able to catch anybody. In 1965, Tommy (played by Gil Bellows)\u000aarrives in Shawshank for a two year sentence. He's a young guy who\u000aloves Rock and Roll. He wants to be educated and Andy starts to teach\u000ahim. At one point, Tommy hears Andy's story and reveals that Andy is\u000ainnocent. Andy confronts the warden with this statement, but he's\u000aafraid Andy will reveal to the outside world what happens within the\u000awalls of Shawshank, so he puts Andy in isolation for two months. During\u000ahis stretch in isolation, Tommy gets killed by Byron Hadley, because he\u000aknew too much, although the warden says he tried to escape. Andy meets\u000aRed after getting out of the isolation cell and tells him about his\u000afuture plans, although Red waves it off by stating Andy's being\u000aunrealistic. Andy tells Red to never give up hope. Andy decides he's\u000abeen in prison long enough and escapes through a tunnel he dug during\u000ahis time in prison. The following day, Andy travels to Zihuatanejo, a\u000aplace in Mexico. He leaves with half of Norton's money. The next\u000amorning, Byron Hadley is arrested for being a corrupt guard and the\u000awarden shoots a bullet through his own skull. After serving 40 years,\u000aRed is released from Shawshank. He goes through the same motions as\u000aBrooks did and you get the feeling he'll also hang himself, until he\u000aremembers he made a promise to Andy, so he searches for an old oak tree\u000anear Buxton and finds some money Andy's left for him. He decides to\u000amake the trip to Mexico and rejoices with his old friend Andy, while\u000astating he finally dares to hope.This is, simply put, the best film ever created. It's incredibly\u000apowerful. The film really sucked me in. The chemistry between Andy and\u000aRed is undeniable and the performances from Robbins and Freeman are\u000asuperb. The supportive cast also does a fantastic job. Clancy Brown as\u000aByron Hadley really looks like a despicable bully and Bob Gunton as\u000aSamuel Norton plays his role as the corrupt warden perfectly. This film\u000anever drags and the remains entertaining for all of its 142 minutes.\u000aFilms, in my opinion, don't get any better than the Shawshank\u000aRedemption.\u000a

V\u000aThe Shawshank Redemption is without a doubt one of the most brilliant\u000amovies I have ever seen. Similar to The Green Mile in many respects\u000a(and better than it in almost all of them), these two movies have shown\u000aus that Stephen King is a master not only of horror but also of prose\u000athat shakes the soul and moves the heart. The plot is average, but King\u000adid great things with it in his novella that are only furthered by the\u000adirection, and the acting is so top-rate it's almost scary.Tim Robbins plays Andy Dufrane, wrongly imprisoned for 20 years for the\u000amurder of his wife. The story focuses on Andy's relationship with "Red"\u000aRedding (Morgan Freeman, in probably his best role) and his attempts to\u000aescape from Shawshank. Bob Gunton is positively evil and frightening as\u000aWarden Norton, and there are great performances and cameos all around;\u000athe most prominent one being Gil Bellows (late as Billy of Ally McBeal)\u000aas Tommy, a fellow inmate of Andy's who suffers under the iron will of\u000aNorton.If you haven't seen this movie, GO AND RENT IT NOW. You will not be\u000adisappointed. It is positively the best movie of the '90's, and one of\u000amy Top 3 of all time. This movie is a spectacle to move the mind, soul,\u000aand heart. 10/10\u000a

V\u000aIt is a strange comment to make about a film set inside a prison, but\u000a"The Shawshank Redemption" creates a warm hold on our feelings because\u000ait makes us a member of a family. Many movies offer us vicarious\u000aexperiences and quick, superficial emotions. "Shawshank" slows down and\u000alooks. It uses the narrator's calm, observant voice to include us in\u000athe story of men who have formed a community behind bars. It is deeper\u000athan most films; about continuity in a lifetime, based on friendship\u000aand hope.Interesting that although the hero of the film is the convicted former\u000abanker Andy Dufresne (Tim Robbins), the action is never seen from his\u000apoint of view. The film's opening scene shows him being given two life\u000asentences for the murder of his wife and her lover, and then we move,\u000apermanently, to a point of view representing the prison population and\u000aparticularly the lifer Ellis 'Red' Redding (Morgan Freeman). It is his\u000avoice remembering the first time he saw Andy ("looked like a stiff\u000abreeze would blow him over"), and predicting, wrongly, that he wouldn't\u000amake it in prison.\u000a

V\u000aOne of the finest films made in recent years. It's a poignant story\u000aabout hope. Hope gets me. That's what makes a film like this more than\u000aa movie. It tells a lesson about life. Those are the films people talk\u000aabout 50 or even 100 years from you. It's also a story for freedom.\u000aFreedom from isolation, from rule, from bigotry and hate. Freeman and\u000aRobbins are majestic in their performances. Each learns from the other.\u000aTheir relationship is strong and you feel that from the first moment\u000athey make contact with one another. There is also a wonderful\u000aperformance from legend James Whitmore as Brooks.He shines when it is his time to go back into the world, only to find\u000athat the world grew up so fast he never even got a chance to blink.\u000aStephen King's story is brought to the screen with great elegance and\u000aexcitement. It is an extraordinary motion that people "will" be talking\u000aabout in 50 or 100 years.\u000a

V\u000aIn this Stephen King short story adaption, were amazing. One of the\u000abest prison movies. It is a story about hope and dreams. A friendship\u000abetween inmates. Old fashioned movie without being boring. The story is\u000acaptivating. Powerful acting. The story is narrated by Morgan Freeman.\u000aThat makes the story even more interesting. One of the best movies of\u000athe nineties. "The Shawshank Redemption" will instantly become a\u000afavourite of anyone who watches it. I recommend it to any fan of\u000aStephen King. And also to any fan of Morgan Freeman. But obviously if\u000ayou are a fan, you should have seen it by now, except if you have\u000amissed it. It happens, I don't blame you, you gotta catch up!\u000a

I really\u000aliked the movie because of it's thriller. I liked the movie " Shutter\u000aIsland" because it is as thrilling as this one. The part where Andy\u000agets to know about the killer is the most awesome part of the movie.\u000aThe best part after that was the escape through a dirty place,\u000aeverything in the movie was fantastic.

V\u000aMy advice would be to watch this movie in full before you judge it.\u000aActually, the movie itself is nothing special, but it has some good\u000astuff. From an artistic standpoint, there were some plot elements and\u000acharacter developments I didn't think were totally needed. They do,\u000ahowever, drive the story, which seemed to be their purpose, so I can\u000aaccept them. The leads' combined talents and charisma have a lot to do\u000awith this movie's success. I found the acting to be sensational, the\u000adialogue incredible and the director's abilities to be up to par and\u000athen some. It reminds me of some of those Croatian films that were\u000apopular back in the 1990s. My final rating comes in at seven out of 10\u000astars.\u000a

V\u000aTop250 years will take place in the first place. I think the world's\u000abest film. Excellent script, great players. Red's narration of the\u000astory allows him to speak for all of the prisoners, who sense a\u000afortitude and integrity in Andy that survives the years. Andy will not\u000akiss butt. He will not back down. But he is not violent, just\u000aformidably sure of himself. For the warden (Bob Gunton), he is both a\u000achallenge and a resource; Andy knows all about bookkeeping and tax\u000apreparation, and before long he's been moved out of his prison job in\u000athe library and assigned to the warden's office, where he sits behind\u000aan adding machine and keeps tabs on the warden's ill-gotten gains. His\u000afame spreads, and eventually he's doing the taxes and pension plans for\u000amost of the officials of the local prison system.\u000a

V\u000aOne of the Best movie I have been seen.If you don't love Shaw shank,\u000achances are you're beyond redemption. This movie is based on a novella\u000aby Stephen King, but don't let that put you off. It's not a horror\u000afilm, rather a thumpingly good ode to friendship, hope, wit, wiles and\u000awisdom, brimming with crackling characters and topped with the most\u000atwisteroo of twists since The Crying Game. Found guilty of killing his\u000aunfaithful wife and her lover in a fit of passion, sullen accountant\u000aAndy Dufresne (Robbins, casting off his goofball image to display more\u000alayers than the proverbial onion) is shipped to the Gothic wind-swept\u000acorridors of the Shawshank State Prison for life. It is here the movie\u000agracefully unfolds. With a beautifully rounded script, writer/director\u000aDarabont conjures up a spellbinding personal odyssey stretching through\u000athe years from 1946 to 1967.Dufresne, all the while protesting his innocence, slowly overcomes the\u000ahellfire tortures of the prison system - an unblinking range of\u000abeatings, rapings and abject humiliations - while managing to inspire\u000ahis fellow inmates to lift their degraded horizons. Among them is Red\u000a(Freeman, in a matchless supporting role), the lifer who can, given\u000atime, provide virtually anything. And for reasons best known to\u000ahimself, Dufresne requires 40s starlet Rita Hayworth, provisioned in\u000aposter form.The mood swings rigorously through every emotion as the cranky, wiseguy\u000aand downright crazed array of criminals bare the brunt of the turbulent\u000alife within the doomy Shawshank catacomb. Then it gets really mean,\u000agearing up for its injury-time shockers. Dufresne, a whiz with figures,\u000ais bullied into running the warden's (Gunton) petty accounting scams,\u000agiving him the chance to execute his and the film's final, greatest\u000amiracle.If you're miserable enough to look for gripes then, yes, it does drift\u000aon too long and who needs prison buggery again? Yet the ending has such\u000apoetic completeness you're too busy contentedly chuckling to worry\u000aabout sore behinds. This may have confounded American audiences - it\u000aflopped big-time on planet Yank - but a more divine movie experience\u000ayou will not find this side of Oscardom. Spread the word.\u000a

The whole movie is just\u000aconstantly interesting and even if you don't watch the film for the\u000aactors or the writers or the produces, you stay for the story. Because\u000alets be honest, there is nothing better than a prison break story. The\u000aconstant changes in story lines, learning about each characters lives\u000ain and out of the prison walls, the relationships formed and broken,\u000aand the beautifully narrated story is one great film that helped me\u000areally see things from an interesting perspective. All in all, i give\u000athis movie 10/10 because there are many prison movies out there, but\u000athis one takes the cake.\u000a

V\u000aThis is an awesome movie I have ever seen. The movie is pretty old but,\u000athe old is gold it seems in here. This is sort of prison break but the\u000away it's been done is terrific. I am not too fond of the Tim Robbins,\u000astill he was really just the center of attraction. I think everyone\u000ashould watch the movie, even the young stars as well. In my views the\u000acharacter Andy Dufresne was a perfect manipulator and planner, and a\u000agood friend as well. I mostly liked the chemistry between Freeman and\u000aTim, the way Tim left some stuffs for freeman, might be needed for to\u000ago forward. And after a long time how a prisoner has become habituated\u000awith loo permission.The evens were not surprising, but the way it was reflected was\u000atremendous.

V\u000aI'm shocking what a true genuine movie is that. Every time you see this\u000amovie! You feel like it fresh. Awesome movie I ever watch in my entire\u000alife....itself a testament to overcoming odds. It is sentimental and\u000astereotyped, yet we are able not only to suspend our disbelief but to\u000aroot for it all the way.It's an old-school melodrama at heart, sturdy\u000aand forthright and upstanding, but without a whisper of complexity or\u000awit. I have not read Stephen King's novella (his first non-horror), but\u000asome of the movie's deficiencies, such as the old-fashioned morality\u000atale and portentous message and redemption--must have been in the\u000asource material.An amazing movie. Easily one of the best movies made\u000aduring the 90s and definitely one of the top 'prison' movies of all-\u000atime. Pretty much everything about this movie works and works extremely\u000awell!It may deserve to be generally regarded as (one of) the most\u000aoverrated film(s) ever made, but it is above all a wonderful, uplifting\u000aand deeply touching tale of hope and perseverance that certainly\u000adeserves to be remembered as one of the best adaptations of a Stephen\u000aKing story. Before we can critically assess The Shawshank Redemption,\u000awe first have to deal with The Shawshank Reputation. In addition to its\u000aOscar nominations and huge critical acclaim, the film has topped the\u000aIMDb Top 250 for years and shows no signs of dropping off any time\u000asoon. Any attempt to criticism it could come across\u000a

The film\u000atouches upon many subjects, including the ideas of hope, redemption,\u000alove, loneliness, justice, life/death, friendship, endurance, fear,\u000apatience, inspiration and so much more.Watching this movie always makes me feel a million times better, and if\u000athat's not the greatest reason to watch a film, I don't know what is.\u000aGive it up to both Freeman and Robbins for completely engulfing their\u000acharacters with heart, soul and the spirit of humanity. I appreciated\u000athe message in this film, I absolutely loved the way it ended, I\u000asurrendered to its pace, I enjoyed all of its characters, I thought it\u000awas wonderfully photographed, I loved the score and I could seriously\u000awatch this movie 10 times a year and not bat an eyelash the whole way\u000athrough.Love it, watch it, get your own motivation from it and surrender to its\u000aspirit which gives anyone in the world hope to do whatever they dream\u000ato do in life. It's like I quoted back at the top of this review, you\u000abetter "get busy living, or get busy dying". It don't get more black\u000aand white than that.

If you are figuring out what to watch between this and the\u000agodfather (because that's what the top 250 said) then choose this one!\u000aIt has elements in it that we can all relate to or inspire to and\u000aelements in which we can all escape to through another world we don't\u000aknow about. I chose this film as my first review as i thought it was\u000aworth my while so take the hint please! If you like sci-fi fantasy be\u000aprepared to not be amazed in this area but i would say it is a fantasy\u000athrough the eyes of Red (Morgan Freeman's character) because he does go\u000aon a bit about how he has never seen someone like Andy (Tim Robbins)\u000abefore. If Morgan Freeman thinks he's cool then he is cool therefore\u000athis film is cool end of.\u000a

V\u000aOne of the finest movies ever made. Nothing unnecessary for commercial\u000avalue is added, sticked to the story. A genius story, excellent actors.\u000aThe movie is in narrative style by Morgan Freeman. The story revolves\u000aaround Andy a banker who has been arrested for murdering his wife. The\u000astory unfolds as Andy's behavior is distinctly different from other\u000ajail members. His wit and cunning nature keeps the audience keen to\u000amake his next move. the twists were not included for the sake of it. It\u000ais meant to be. Watch it, if by any chance you haven't yet. One of the\u000afinest English film of all time. Plot details have been avoided in the\u000areview just to avoid spoilers, its just too good.\u000a

V\u000aMovie is really a masterpiece. I had already watched it many times and\u000ai am going watch again many times in future.An amazing movie. Easily\u000aone of the best movies made during the 90's and definitely one of the\u000atop 'prison' movies of all-time. Pretty much everything about this\u000amovie works and works extremely well! A simple story that touches the\u000abottom of the heart. The concept of this movie is the best and unique.\u000aNo Action ,Fight ,Drama ,Romance. Just a sober bond of emotions. The\u000awork done by Tim Robbins, Morgan Freeman deserves a great\u000aapplause.Watching these actors work together is a real treat, and they\u000amore than make up for the script's deficiencies. No Oscar is bad luck\u000aof this movie but 16 awards is what it deserves.Powerful, poignant,\u000athought- provoking and finally irresistibly uplifting. At end i would\u000arecommend everyone to watch this movie once.\u000a

V\u000aOne of my all time favorites. Shawshank Redemption is a very moving\u000astory about hope and the power of friendship. The cast is first rate\u000awith everyone giving a great performance. Tim Robbins and Morgan\u000aFreeman carry the movie, but Bob Gunton and Clancy Brown are perfect as\u000athe Warden Norton and prison guard captain Hadley respectively. And\u000aJames Whitmore's portrayal of an elderly inmate Brooks is moving. The\u000ascreenplay gives almost every actor at least one or more memorable\u000alines through out the film. As well as a very surprising "twist" near\u000athe end that almost knocked me out of my chair. If you have not seen\u000athis movie rent it or better yet buy it. As I bet you'll want to see\u000athis one more than once.\u000a

V\u000aI was jaded in my bed after a long boring day walking around with my\u000agreat-aunt and I didn't know what to do. I was literally exhausted but\u000aI wanted to perk myself up with something awe- inspiring for boosting\u000amy spent brain. I decided to type in Google "The best movie ever" and\u000athen appeared the Top 250 from IMBDb, the world's most popular source\u000afor movies and TV shows. The first one was called "The Shawshank\u000aRedemption" by Frank Darabond, and I started to watch it without\u000astopping even a second. It was a movie about an imprisoned man\u000asearching for freedom, "That's exactly what I need tonight" I said to\u000amyself. As the movie was moving forward, I became more disappointed, maybe\u000abecause of my bad mood and my great expectations about the movie. I was\u000awatching THE movie, not merely another one to pass the time. What was\u000ahappening? Asking myself this question I realized that it was my fault\u000aand I decided to watch the movie through a different lens and have a\u000apositive attitude. From then on, everything changed, my blindness\u000adisappeared and the film met my expectations: It perked me up and gave\u000ame goosebumps. In the final scene, I was crying like a child, I felt a\u000alittle foolish. Every aspect of Shawshank fit together. The story is incredibly well\u000anarrated, it keeps you interested throughout the film, it provides all\u000athe information you need to follow along, and is completely believable,\u000aeven Andy is a kind of genius and has to put in practice astonishing\u000aideas for escape from the prison. Analyzing the back-story, it was a\u000ahigh budget film and I'm sure it is the masterpiece of Frank Darabont\u000aand Tim Robbins (at least). The characters are played well, seemed like\u000areal people and I especially love Andy's one, I will never forget the\u000asarcastic smile of Tim Robbins withdrawing money from his false\u000aaccount. Film prop and costumes are useful and fits the mood, and\u000amusical score by Thomas Newman helps move the movie along. Regarding\u000athe filming techniques, the use of long takes, close ups, and slow\u000azooms toward the characters make the story intimate enough to affect\u000athe audience. Finally, in relation to its pacing and organization I\u000athink the film flows well, not too short or too long. On the other hand, if you ask me for the weak points of the movie, I\u000acould point out the Tommy storyline. We already know Andy is innocent\u000aand we know also how corrupt the system is. What's the point of that? My overall verdict: 8/10. A great movie, but not the best movie ever by\u000afar.\u000a

V\u000aAn amazing movie. One of the best movies made during the 90s and\u000adefinitely one of the top 'prison' movies of all-time...Tim Robbins and\u000aMorgan Freeman at their best. A true classic. If you haven't seen it, I\u000arecommend you go watch it as soon as possible!After being convicted of murdering his wife, something he denies, smart\u000aand banker Andy Duffrain (Tim Robbins) is sent to Shawshank prison,\u000awhich is run by a corrupt warden (Bob Gunton). He makes friends with\u000asome of the inmates but his closest relationship is with Red (Morgan\u000aFreeman) a wise lifer who is a you want it, he can get sort of guy.\u000aAfter many years there, and after the last straw from the warden, Andy\u000adoes something that will be remembered throughout the history of\u000aShawshank prison. The lot of this film is equally incredible with story\u000aand characters, we love whats going on the entire film because every\u000amoment is important to the ending of the film, and the characters of\u000athe movie are just perfection, Andy and Red as best friends is probably\u000athe greatest friendship I have ever seen a film and that makes it\u000aimpossible to dislike them and how colorful and fun the supporting\u000acharacters are, what an incredible and beautiful movie that shows the\u000ahorrors of prison. The cast is just incredible, Tim Robbins plays his\u000amost memorable and best performance of his career if you ask me, and\u000aMorgan Freeman has also his greatest role to date and truly deserved\u000ahis Oscar as much as everyone else that year, they were just\u000aincredible.\u000a

V\u000aFirst of all sorry for my not perfect English, it's not my native\u000alanguage.In my opinion "The Shawshank Redemption" is one of the best movies\u000awhich I seen so far! Twenty years ago this movie was a "low-key prison"\u000afilm that didn't get back its costs. But now it has become one of the\u000amost popular movies of all time! Everything is amazing there: actors\u000aplay, shooting scenes, the story itself of course... I already have\u000aseen it more than 10 times and I believe that I definitely will do it\u000aagain once more!This is first movie and the only one which I rated with 10 stars!\u000a

V\u000aI've always enjoyed a good prison series/film, but this one exceeded\u000aall others! My favorite part of the film was definitely when the main\u000aactor made an alliance with Morgan freeman! Such great chemistry there,\u000athere were also some tense moments. It is not one of them films which I\u000acan easily watch over and over simply because it is such a long film\u000aand because it takes a while to forget the plot, and if you have\u000aalready watched it, the build up to seeing the main actor escape the\u000aprison is no longer a tense surprising moment.So clever and the casting\u000awas perfect! I think the film sells itself! In perspective i would rate\u000athis film 10/10 for everything, even with the age of the film (1994) it\u000awill always be a "one to watch" film for generations to come.\u000a

V\u000aThe Shawshank Redemption is in my mind undeniably the greatest movie\u000aever made. This film breaks down the essence of human existence,\u000aembodies the human condition, and shows that when knocked down there is\u000aalways hope. Just as Andy said "hope is a good thing, maybe the best of\u000athings, and no good thing ever dies". That is what this film is it is\u000anot just a prison film it is not just a redemption story it is truly a\u000alesson. This film is a masterpiece only a few films in existence come\u000aremotely close to this movie but none can compare.I would recommend this film to everyone because what you get out of it\u000ais all based on your beliefs but everyone can agree that this is a\u000amasterpiece that should endure throughout the ages.\u000a

You learn of Andy and being\u000asent to prison. The acting is phenomenal, and of course, the viewer is\u000atreated with narration from Morgan Freeman throughout the movie.After that, you get to know each character well, all excellently\u000awritten and diverse. The script is highly intelligent, and the dialogue\u000aflows in a smooth and believable way.You find yourself gripped for EVERY second as Andy's perfect plan\u000aunfolds, into a tremendous climax, leaving you emotional as you have\u000aseen his struggle.If anyone considers themselves a movie fan, then they not only should\u000ahave seen this film; they should own it.One of the best!!\u000a

V\u000aWhen I started watching the movie, I thought: This is going to be\u000aanother one of those movies drama in prison, where the guy suffers and\u000aescapes and lives happily forever. Just waiting there. Not so. The film\u000areaches the spiritual side of things. Shows how this affects people\u000apsychologically. Having cut his freedom is yes, one of the worst things\u000ain the world, even when there is no fault. But when you get used to the\u000aplace, the rules, what is inside you, it becomes your place, your\u000atruth. And then you go out. Now what? How do I live? I do not know no\u000amore walking on the street! This can really drive someone insane.\u000aAnother important point is the issue of corruption in jail. Not that\u000acommon place fell to be the focus of this thing. Was already\u000astructured, it was not something that needed to be nor explained.\u000aCorruption in the chain is already so common to us, which is not\u000asomething that needs 20 minutes of film to explain how it works -\u000adespite the great scene in the library where Andy pro account as Red in\u000aShawshank laundering scheme works.\u000a

V\u000aThe story of a man struggling to survive in one of the most hostile\u000aenvironments possibly know by any human being took my breath away. He\u000adid not deserve to be there, he was innocent from the beginning, but\u000ainstead of claiming his innocence, he worked from day one to find a way\u000ato scape from all that. He never quit fighting. A lesson to us all. The\u000aplots are amazingly driven. The characters arc is strong and\u000aunderstandable from begging to end. Photography is captivating. Acting\u000ais precise, and reach the soul of the subtext all the way. The director\u000areally knew how to pull together an award winning team. Every aspect of\u000athe script is taken care of. The producers went the distance in this\u000aone. A masterclass in acting, directing, photography, production but\u000amost important, scriptwriting. Thou I did not read the book, I guess\u000athe film did justice to it. I'm sure Steven King feels really proud of\u000ait. A must see to everyone who loves good films, or pretends to break\u000ainto the film industry.\u000a

V\u000aThe Shawshank Redemption is a 1994 American drama film written and\u000adirected by Frank Darabont and starring Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman.\u000aIt is ranked #1 in IMDb's "Top 250" list and is considered one of the\u000abest movies of all time -Says WikipediaParents need to know that this movie is rated R for a reason: The\u000agritty world of Shawshank Prison is populated with sadistic guards, a\u000acorrupt warden, and predatory fellow inmates. Two characters have sex\u000a(their clothes are on, and it's not graphic), one lovable character\u000ahangs himself, guards shoot an inmate and frame it as an escape\u000aattempt, inmates attempt and, we are told, succeed in raping Andy, and\u000aguards beat and kill an inmate in the opening scenes. But the film also\u000ashows inmates forming a loving community of friendship and support\u000adespite oppressive conditions.Must watch movie.before u die !!\u000a

V\u000aThe story begins with the trial of a young banker, Andy Dufrense,\u000avictimized by circumstantial evidence, resulting in a conviction for\u000athe murder of his wife and her lover. After a quick conviction, Andy\u000afinds himself serving a life sentence at Shawshank prison, with no hope\u000aof parole. He exists in this prison only in appearance, keeping his\u000amind free from the drab walls around him. His ability to do this\u000aresults in the gaining of respect from his fellow inmates, but most of\u000aall from Ellis Redding. Ellis, commonly referred to as Red, finds\u000againful use of his entrepreneurial spirit within the drab walls of\u000aShawshank by dealing in contraband and commodities rare to the confines\u000aof prison. Andy's demeanor and undeniable sense of hope causes Red to\u000atake a deeper look at himself, and the world around him. Andy proves to\u000aRed and the other inmates that in the conventional walls of Shawshank\u000aprison convention will find no home in his lifestyle.By creating the film's firm foundation, the meticulously chiseled\u000ascreenplay paved the way for this film's success. Frank Darabont\u000aoutdoes himself with the phenomenal adaptation of Stephen King's\u000aequally noteworthy novella, Rita Hayworth and Shawshank Redemption. In\u000athis novella, King demonstrates that he can break free from the genre\u000ahe dominates and still create a marvelous piece of modern literature.\u000aThough the film mirrors the novella in many ways, Darabont illustrates\u000aa focused objective of improving upon the areas where the novella came\u000aup short, resulting in one of the best book to film transitions ever.While maintaining some of the poetic and moving dialogue of the\u000anovella, Darabont also proves that a film's score can generate a great\u000adeal of emotional response from its audience, as dialogue does. He\u000aemploys the cunning Thomas Newman, son of the legendary Hollywood\u000acomposer, Alfred Newman. Darabont shows recognition for the film's\u000aneeds by employing Newman, who makes the gentle piano chords whisper\u000asoftly to the viewer, as if a part of the scripted dialogue. Newman\u000alends himself to individualism and tends to drive more towards the\u000aunique in the realm of score composition. His effort in Shawshank did\u000anot go unnoticed, as his score received an Oscar nomination in 1995.\u000aWhile unique and independent, Newman's score never once intrudes on\u000ayour concentration or distracts from the film.With work from vast array of talented scene designers, costume\u000adesigners, composers, cinematographers, and various other Hollywood\u000aartists, the cast of The Shawshank Redemption had a strong foundation\u000ato work with. The marvelous cast of this film will dazzle you with some\u000aof the most convincing performances you will witness in a film. While\u000aboth Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman shine as Andy and Red,\u000arespectively, the true spectacle of acting lies within the plethora of\u000aamazing supporting actors who easily disappear into their roles. Most\u000anoticeable of these, the veteran film star James Whitmore, who portrays\u000athe elderly Brooks Hatlen. Brooks, a man incarcerated for an\u000aunmentioned crime for so long that he finds himself attached to the\u000aShawshank and the daily life he has lead. Each of these actors show a\u000atrue dedication to their art, and a focused purpose in their\u000amotivations, creating a convincing setting that never once caters to\u000aanything unbelievable.\u000a

V\u000aI don't think Shawshank is perfect. To be honest I don't even think it\u000adeserves the #1 at the IMDb Top 250. The thing about it is that you can't point anything wrong, there is\u000anothing that anybody would really dislike. The highest note is somewhat\u000aodd though, it would not make my own top 10, despite of all the\u000acompliments I could make about it.There are a few memorable quotes, the always great Morgan Freeman, but\u000anothing that i would call outstanding. A good movie, definitely worth\u000awatching, but not one of those you would watch over and over again\u000auntil you got all dialogues by heart.\u000a

V\u000aThe Shawshank Redemption is the perfect movie because it touches the\u000ahearts of so many people and it is one of the greatest atypical, drama\u000afilms of the 90's. It draws us in as if we are apart of a great\u000amovement showing us how to open our minds and explore the endless\u000apossibilities. Shawshank walks you through detailed moments in the\u000afilm, which is narrated in a soothing voice to involve us in a story of\u000amen who have built a union in prison. The film begins telling a story of a young successful banker, Andy\u000aDufresne (Tim Robbins) convicted for the murder of his wife and her\u000alover who is sentenced to two life prison terms consecutively. Andy is\u000atransferred to Shawshank State Prison where he meets a fellow inmate,\u000aEllis "Red" Redding (Morgan Freeman) serving a life sentence as well.\u000aAndy's demeanor was quiet and reserved, typical of a new prisoner. As\u000ahe walks through the prison gates you hear a voice, "looked like a\u000astiff breeze would blow him over". Red soon realizes he judged Andy\u000ainappropriately that he wouldn't last in the prison sector longer than\u000a2 weeks and later becomes very close friends. Andy initially jeopardizes his life to build trust and friendships with\u000aothers in prison including the warden and prison guards. There is a\u000aturn of events enabling him to regain his life back through\u000amanipulation and self-determination. The double cross and trickery that\u000ais done to the Warden and the head prison guard at the end of the movie\u000ais so gratifying to see play out. Red is finally paroled after he told\u000athe board that he really didn't care how they voted after 40 years of\u000abeing behind bars and two rejected parole hearings. His emotions of\u000adefiance and inspiration, ultimately is what grants his freedom. The\u000amovie will take you through a host of emotions, which has a great\u000aending. The name of the prison and redemption refers to the action of\u000aredeeming. The movie shows how one can recover from past mistakes\u000athrough resiliency. The old adage, "What does not hurt you makes you\u000astronger" holds true to moving forward with life and starting over.I believe the editing in the film was appropriate because the scenes\u000awere cut at just the right and precise time to introduce the next scene\u000aand new characters. It was not choppy and the movie flowed perfectly\u000aspanning over 20 years.The photography of The Shawshank Redemption takes the realism approach\u000ato how the scenes are displayed and captured. The scenes that are\u000ainside the prison are gloomy and full of darkness portraying fear,\u000aauthority, and violence. They make the viewer feel emotionally\u000aconnected to the circumstances exposed in prison with the characters.\u000aWhen the inmates are out in the prison yard the film shots are open and\u000abright, though it is still a prison, the outside scenes have a\u000adifferent feel to them. This is because when the other population is\u000aoutside, it is a small touch of freedom, though there are guards\u000aeverywhere and barbed wire fences restricting their every move. This\u000amay be the only time where inmates feel a sense of freedom or autonomy. The film was very enjoyable but did move along very slowly. It was\u000ainteresting to see how a man who was innocent of a crime he was\u000aconvicted of and never vindicated. Also, in the process it was\u000aintriguing to watch Andy manipulate the warden and the prison guards to\u000aget what he needed and wanted to fulfill his true desires. It's a must\u000asee movie because it was a good compelling story line based on a man's\u000acourage, will, and tenacity to never give up. Despite the many\u000aobstacles Andy faced almost daily, he had the ability to maintain his\u000ainnocence and intelligence while staying focused on his ultimate goal\u000aof obtaining his independence again.\u000a

V\u000aOne of the best performances of Morgan Freeman and probably the best\u000aone for Tim Robbins. I never get tired of watching it again and again.\u000aThis story, keeps you aware the entire duration of the movie, and the\u000asoundtrack, one of my favorites composed by Thomas Newman gives the\u000atale even more grandeur. It's an impeccable direction from Frank\u000aDarabont, as he did on The Green Mile. Also it might make you\u000areconsider some aspects of your life and to value more your time. The\u000aphotography, costume, art direction, all of them are astonishing which\u000adeserved many more prizes and recognitions than it received. It's\u000adefinitely one the best films made on the 90's and it's a piece of art\u000aint the film history. Nowadays I wish and I hope in Hollywood were made\u000asuch great films as The Shawshank Redemption, but it seems lack of new\u000aideas and making remakes every year. In my humble opinion, what\u000aHollywood needs it's an entire REBOOT, not only with screenwriters but\u000ain direction and production.\u000a

V\u000aI watched this movie about five years ago. I am right now 21 and i love\u000ato watch movies especially new ones. My favorite genre is Action,\u000aThriller and Comedy but this drama was one of the best movies that i\u000ahave watched in the last five years. So if you didn't watch this one\u000amake sure you do it! Amazing story, fantastic actors (Freeman) my\u000afavorite one. Injustice and the real life are represented in this film.\u000aMy advice to sit back grab some popcorn and watch it in the night, the\u000abetter the effect. By the end you do not know what's going to happen,\u000aexciting and interesting. It is well recorded, and my opinion is that\u000adeserves a clear 10. Cheers!\u000a

V\u000aThere are times when I want to reminisce the great movies I have\u000awatched, to satisfy my pride of being a good movie watcher. This is\u000awhen some would want to segregate the greatest of movies into great\u000amovies and great movies you would remember till the end of time. The\u000aShawshank Redemption falls in the latter category. This movie is so\u000ainspiring that it lifts your morale no matter how beaten up in your\u000alife at that point of time. It is must watch for anyone who wants to\u000acal himself Homo Sapiens. The awe-striking fact about this movie is that it didn't win The\u000aAcademy Awards for Best Picture. This is a testimony to the great\u000adilemma the jury of the 67th Academy Awards must have been. Comparing\u000asome of the greatest movies ever made like The Shawshank Redemption,\u000aForrest Gump, Pulp Fiction, etc. must have been a hell of a job. But\u000aeven then this movie is truly a wonder by Frank Darabont, one which\u000awill always end up in the debate for the greatest movie ever made by\u000amankind. And to me this is a bigger award than the Academy Awards.\u000a

Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman is awesome in this movie.One of\u000athe great movie of the year. Martin Lewison has wrote it to very\u000areality. There are many stories like this surround us and they are\u000areally noticeable. The life of Andy Dufresne at prison was miserable\u000aand panic but he keep on moving to get his final hope.Today most Prison\u000alives reflect these things but there is no solution to fix it.

V\u000aWhen I've seen this movie, I had just one movie with a 10-rating and\u000adidn't believe this could beat it (in my opinion). However, when the\u000acredits started, I knew why this is on the top: People have large\u000aexpectations on "The Shawshank Redemption" and also their all-time\u000afavourite movies, but it seems it can touch nearly every person deeply.\u000aI really love this masterpiece from the beginning to the end, but I\u000adon't think it's perfect, the beginning is a little bit too violent and\u000amostly I don't like erotic scenes (because it seems like the movie\u000awants a cheap upgrade).

V\u000aMisery and Stand By Me were the best adaptations up until this one, now\u000ayou can add Shawshank to that list.This is simply one of the best films ever made and I know I am not the\u000afirst to say that and I certainly won't be the last. The standing on\u000athe IMDb is a true barometer of that. #3 as of this date and I'm sure\u000ait could be number 1. So I'll just skip all the normal praise of the\u000afilm because we all know how great it is. But let me perhaps add that\u000awhat I find so fascinating about Shawshank is that Stephen King wrote\u000ait.King is one of the best writers in the world. Books like IT and the\u000aCastle Rock series are some of the greatest stories ever told. But his\u000abest adaptations are always done by the best directors. The Shining was\u000abrilliantly interpreted by Kubrick and of course the aforementioned\u000aMisery and Stand By Me are both by Rob Reiner. Now Frank Darabont comes\u000aonto the scene and makes arguably the best King film ever. He seems to\u000aunderstand what King wants to say and he conveys that beautifully.\u000a

V\u000aCity Banker, Andy Dufresne, arrived at Shawshank State Prison in 1947,\u000aconvicted of two brutal murders, he received a double life sentence.\u000aSoon he discovers that when they send you to Shawshank Prison for life,\u000athat is exactly what they take. Within the confines of Shawshank, Andy\u000aforms a friendship with a fellow prisoner Red. He also becomes popular\u000awith the warden and the prison guards, as Andy is able to use his\u000abanking experience to help the corrupt officials amass personal\u000afortunes. Andy learns a life lesson in Shawshank and that is either get\u000abusy living or get busy dying.This film starred: Mark Robbins, Morgan Freeman & William Sadler.The Shawshank Redemption is down as the greatest film of all time on\u000athis site. I disagree. Although this is a remarkable film and I admire\u000aall that it has achieved, I just don't see it as the best film ever and\u000aisn't one of my personal favourites, this is in my opinion.

V\u000aThis is a film about people and the choices they make, the choices that\u000aare made for them. Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman take the viewer on a\u000aroller coaster of emotions ride attempting to help the viewer\u000aunderstand their world, a prison world. It is made pretty clear early\u000aon that their world and our world are very different from one another\u000abut due to exquisite writing and equally exquisite acting we (the\u000aviewer) get to see the horrors of Shawshank prison, and even thought\u000aeveryone is guilty (to one extent or another) you can't help but feel a\u000acertain kinship with the two main actors and to even some of their less\u000acompanions. I read the Novella on which this movie was based and the\u000amovie is every bit as good and the book which is a testament to Frank\u000aDarabont's directing and screen writing abilities. The film is about\u000aCorruption abuse of power the human spirit, redemption and humanity and\u000athere is a reason it is # 1 on IMDb's top 250 list. it is well\u000aconceived, well written, well acted and well paced, it is the kind of\u000afilm that even when you have seen it a dozen time and it is late, when\u000ayou stumble upon it while channel surfing you still can not help but\u000astop and watch it till the end credits, it is just a fantastic film\u000afrom start to finish.\u000a

V\u000aFreeman, who is simply a great actor, a man who has never struck a\u000afalse note in his career, both narrates this tale and anchors it with\u000ahis authoritative playing. Anyone who read the Stephen King novel knows\u000ared turns from a white guy to a black one. and the guard casually\u000aripping the poster at the end is different but other than those small\u000achanges, everything else is on point. This is the best prison movie\u000aever made in my opinion. Certain ironies play out very well in this\u000afilm. For instance the head sister who get cripple when Andy has had\u000aenough of his ilk. A 'life-affirming' tale about life imprisonment, The\u000aShawshank Redemption is the kind of old-fashioned entertainment that is\u000aeasily overvalued in an era of diminishing expectations.\u000a

V\u000aThis was an intricately woven tale of an innocent man. He would be our\u000amodern day Joseph if you will. What makes it so unusual is that he is a\u000awhite collar tax accountant that ultimately has to use his knowledge to\u000akeep him alive and in a safer position than with the regular population\u000aof the prison. The characters and scenes are carefully crafted to\u000ahorrify and titillate the audience. His wife the victim whom this\u000aentire debauched attempt at justice centers, is eliminated, early on as\u000ashe is caught in an unfortunate love triangle whilst her husband is\u000ahard at work providing for her needs. He is then incarcerated for the\u000acrime and the action continues to build in one tragic incident to the\u000anext until he meets a true friend behind bars. The Sisters are\u000atreacherous. The Warden and Captain of the Guard maniacs. The prisoners\u000aare utterly lost, uneducated, and misused. There are many victims in\u000athis somewhat heroic tale. Had this man never been framed the light of\u000areason would have never illuminated the conditions of prisons. They\u000aprobably would have been overlooked perhaps another 20 or 30 years. He\u000awas the voice of reason that so eloquently told his tale of astonishing\u000amisfortune in the first person.\u000a

V\u000aI have never seen such an amazing film since I saw The Shawshank\u000aRedemption. Shawshank encompasses friendships, hardships, hopes, and\u000adreams. And what is so great about the movie is that it moves you, it\u000agives you hope. Even though the circumstances between the characters\u000aand the viewers are quite different, you don't feel that far removed\u000afrom what the characters are going through.It is a simple film, yet it has an everlasting message.

Why\u000athis movie didn't win all seven Oscars is beyond me, but don't let that\u000asway you to not see this film, let its ranking on the IMDb's top 250\u000alist sway you, let your friends recommendation about the movie sway\u000ayou.Set aside a little over two hours tonight and rent this movie.

V\u000aI've watched this movie for the first time like 20 years ago (when i\u000awas a little boy), but recently friend of mine wanted to watch it\u000aagain, so we did. Nowadays movies are full of clichés and remakes of\u000aold good movies, but compared to this one they are like crap. Tons of\u000amoney are wasted on 3D effects, sound and other 'extras', but the\u000amovies are bad. They are no new stories... only the same old stories -\u000avampires, aliens, fast cars, war and the drama... so much dramas... why\u000awould we want watch some dramas? Ain't we living our own dramas every\u000aday? This is a masterpiece movie and i regret that no one make such\u000agood movies anymore!\u000a

V\u000aThe Shawshank redemption is about a man who is wrongly accused of\u000amurdering his wife and her lover and sentenced to life in prison. In\u000aprison the man makes friends with the inmates while improving the\u000aprison's library. He also gives financial advice to the prison security\u000aguards and personnel. The theme of this film, The Shawshank Redemption,\u000ais about finding friendship and having hope while being at a hard time\u000ain your life. Andy Dufresne is play by Tim Robbins and is the main\u000acharacter who is accused of murdering his wife and her lover in a\u000ajealous rage. Morgan Freeman also plays a huge part in this film as\u000aEllis "Red" Boyd. Ellis or Red as he preferred to be called in the film\u000ais Andy's best friend in prison. There are five main plot points in my\u000aopinion within this film. These points include when the inmates are\u000abetting on the new arrivals, when some of the inmates are re-tarring\u000athe roof on one of the buildings, when new library books finally arrive\u000aafter all of Andy's attempts, and when the warden of Shawshank\u000adiscovers that Andy has escaped. This films theme is similar to the\u000aretelling of the mythical story of "Perseus" by author Edith Hamilton.\u000aThere are several techniques that were used throughout this film but a\u000afew really caught my attention. The first technique is a motif, this is\u000athe repeated showing of the crow that Brooks rescued and raised. The\u000abirds represent a hopefulness of freedom but it also represented the\u000aloss of hope after prison. When Brooks is released, he also sets "Jake"\u000athe crow free and continues to look for him in a park nearby hoping\u000athat he will return to him. However, when Jake does not return it\u000arepresents the loss of hope in Brooks for life after prison. Another\u000atechnique that attributed to the emotions of the film was the lighting\u000aaspects. In the scene after Andy escapes where he is standing in water\u000awhile it is raining with his arms spread wide, the light is directed\u000adown on him with his back in the shadows. This lighting technique in\u000athis scene adds to the feeling of triumph, of hope and of freedom. This\u000afilm absolutely reflects the feeling of hope onto the viewers.\u000a

V\u000aRobbins kills as does Freeman. Amazing supporting cast. Everything is\u000aflawless from the camera work to the editing. Some might say that the\u000aside stories and other occasional story slowdowns drain it a bit but in\u000amy opinion these elements really only serve to better the buildup for\u000awhat is maybe the greatest ending of a film ever. The location the film\u000awas shot in is also perfect and really adds to just how fun this movie\u000ais to watch. I wouldn't dare to tempt anyone with spoilers but if you\u000ahaven't seen this movie then you are really missing a huge moment. Not\u000ajust in cinema history. But also in terms of appreciating life. And\u000afreedom.\u000a

V\u000aThe Shawshank Redemption is one of the finest, most interesting films\u000aever made; without a doubt. It's the highest-rated film on IMDb and I\u000acan honestly see why. It deserves it very much. 9.3 is something! It's incredible and interesting, with remarkable directing, extremely\u000agreat and actually inspiring dialogue and acting, great scenes and so\u000amuch more and beyond. It's absolutely inexplicable, it cannot be done\u000aby words, to describe how astonishing this masterpiece of a film is -\u000ait really took filmmaking a step further, beyond shadows and light -\u000aand as crazy as it sounds, it's the genuine true. I don't know why I waited this long to write an extremely positive\u000areview on The Shawshank Redemption. There aren't many films that top\u000athis one, in particular. It really is an A+ film and achievement.\u000aFilmmaking at its absolute finest. Truly. The Shawshank Redemption is definitely a list-topper and usually always\u000acomes in amongst the top 10 best films ever made; i wonder\u000awhy.......haha, of course i don't - it's very understandable. I rate the Shawshank Redemption 10/10 - and it deserves that rating, as\u000ait's that good. Genius-filmmaking; genius everything! Outstanding.\u000a

V\u000aThe Shawshank Redemption is a film of great passion and gritty script.I\u000alove the entire detail structure of the movie.Almost the entire film is\u000ashot at the prison, adding to the feeling of isolation and routine.The\u000asimple yet hard to convey messages could not be handled more subtly\u000athan this.I have almost watched it more than 20 times. The Bond between the characters played by Morgan Freeman (Red) & Tim\u000aRobbins (Andy Dufresne) feels fabulous when you finishes the\u000afilm.Script and Dialogues are top notch. Frank Darabont directs with\u000agenius and masterfully transcending the script and gives something\u000adefinitively spectacular.

V\u000aI first saw this movie on TV and quickly it captured me somehow. The\u000anext day I searched the entire city for a shop to buy this movie and\u000awatch it on DVD. I must say, when I watched it first, I felt like...\u000athis has to be the best movies of all times. I think I cam compare it\u000awith Schindler's list but somehow this is better. Now let's talk about\u000athe movie. This is movie is really dramatic in a way, but it motivates\u000ayou somehow, the main character gives you that power to live more\u000abetter your days, when you see him struggling in that crazy prison. As\u000aeveryone, the main character needs a friend, to get over the worst\u000athing in prison, and he gets Red (M. Freeman) who remains his buddy\u000auntil the end. The movie also show us how a prisoner gets so used to\u000athe prison life, that after he can get out... he doesn't know what to\u000ado with his life anymore. After you see Shawshank Prison, you are\u000athinking about life in another perspective... and after that, you fell\u000alike seeing this movie again... and again! Great movie, and 10 stars\u000afrom me, maybe the only one with this grade.\u000a

V\u000aThis movie got full marks from me.

When I can watch familiar\u000aactors in a movie and believe who they are, I mean fully buy into who\u000athey are portraying and lose myself in the story, that gets good marks\u000afrom me. The story is a simple one but how it is told in this film makes it a\u000abest. Watching how these two men managed to come together as friends\u000awhile existing in a place where you trust nobody was beautifully told\u000awith patience and finesse.I watched this many years ago when it first came out and I just\u000are-watched once again...it has stood the test of time with a top rating\u000afrom me.

V\u000aOne of the best movies I've ever seen, if not really the best. That\u000a"Angel's Prison" name in Romanian, I agree with it. It has marked my\u000asummer vacation last year, I thought about it very much, and how an\u000ainnocent man can be punished for what he didn't do. I also liked his\u000aperseverance, and how he never gave up his ambition to become a free\u000aman, legally or not. The sad part was Brook's death, but I understood\u000ahis decision and agreed with it. I also very much liked the way that\u000aAndy and Red bonded over the time Andy spent in prison, and the things\u000ahe had done for the men in prison, like the library, and the courses he\u000ataught, and how he refused to give up his position, that moment when he\u000aplayed the music.

V\u000aThe movie is definitely one of the best movies i have ever seen, but to\u000abe honest, the movie is also greatly overrated in many ways. I believe\u000athat the reason the movie is so popular is because of the huge wave of\u000apopularity towards voting it up. As the movie portrays the continuous\u000astruggle for the main character, Andy Dufresne, you are in suspense,\u000aand locked by the question whether he did it or not. And even though he\u000akeeps doing good and honorable thing for the guards and his fellow\u000ainmates. There was in my experience not a moment before he escaped\u000awhere you are absolutely certain that he did not do it. This is the\u000athing that captivates a lot of people i think, and i follow this\u000aaspect, and i understand it. But even though this movie, in my opinion\u000adoes not have any flaws, it is still not perfect, and i do not think\u000athat it is the best, not flawed feature film ever made.\u000a

V\u000aIf you're in the mood for a good movie based on a true story that takes\u000aplace during a seemingly simpler time and played by really great\u000aactors, then this movie is a good choice. A man wrongly accused of\u000amurdering his wife is sent to prison where he meets his new life long\u000abest friend, Red. It is the type of movie that pulls you in close so\u000athat you can't help but to like these "criminals". It's not often that\u000aany movie good or bad has a good ending. This movie has a very good\u000aending and leaves you with the answers you were looking for. You laugh,\u000acry (or at least feel like you might),get mad and cheer for the good\u000aguys and the mild mannered sarcasm. A man who never should have been in\u000aprison in the first place ended up making it a much better place,\u000aexposed tax scam, educated others, provided tax advice, made life long\u000afriends, developed allies and THEN receives his redemption. It's a\u000abattle of wits, showing of strength and endurance of pain (emotional &\u000aphysical) throughout the movie. I have never met anyone who hasn't\u000aabsolutely loved this movie.\u000a

V\u000aThe movie Shawshank Redemption is based on a novel from Stephan King.\u000aThe movie is directed by Frank Darabont (1994) and it is one of the\u000abest movies ever made. The movie is not only a depressing story but it\u000acontains friendship, loyalty, hope and wisdom. Andy (Tim Robbins) is\u000aconvicted for the murder of his wife and his lover. he is sent to\u000aShawshank prison. He has a life long sentence and in his time in prison\u000aAndy becomes friends with Red (Morgan Freeman). Andy tries to adapt to\u000athe life in prison and does this together with his friend Red. Through\u000atime Andy overcomes the tortures of prison, and he tries to inspire\u000aother prisoners ("While the body may be locked away in a cell, the\u000aspirit can never be truly imprisoned). The movie shows the\u000adetermination of Andy and leads us into a world of imagination, filled\u000awith courage and desire. The setting of the movie is extremely\u000arealistic and the establishing shot immediately shows the setting of\u000athe movie, so you know what to expect. I personally think Shawshank\u000aRedemption is the best film ever made. It has already been a number one\u000amovie on IMDb for a while now. The costumes, the make-up and acting are\u000adone extremely well and the story is very well thought through. To\u000aconclude, the movie has many inspiring messages in it, such as "never\u000agive up" and "always have hope to achieve what you want" for example.\u000a

Many movies offer us vicarious\u000aexperiences and quick, superficial emotions. "Shawshank" slows down and\u000alooks. It uses the narrator's calm, observant voice to include us in\u000athe story of men who have formed a community behind bars. It is deeper\u000athan most films; about continuity in a lifetime, based on friendship\u000aand hope.From Andy's arrival on the prison bus to the film's end, we see only\u000ahow others see him - Red, who becomes his best friend, Brooks the old\u000alibrarian, the corrupt Warden Norton, guards and prisoners. Red is our\u000asurrogate. He's the one we identify with, and the redemption, when it\u000acomes, is Red's. We've been shown by Andy's example that you have to\u000akeep true to yourself, not lose hope, bide your time, set a quiet\u000aexample and look for your chance. "I guess it comes down to a simple\u000achoice, really," he tells Red. "Get busy living' or get busy dying'."\u000aThe key to the film's structure, I think, is that it's not about its\u000ahero, but about our relationship with him - our curiosity, our pity,\u000aour admiration. If Andy had been the heroic center, bravely enduring,\u000athe film would have been conventional, and less mysterious. But we\u000awonder about this guy. Did he really kill those two people? Why does he\u000akeep so much to himself? Why can he amble through the prison yard like\u000aa free man on a stroll, when everyone else plods or sidles? People like\u000aexcitement at the movies, and titles that provide it do well.There wasn't much going for it: It had a terrible title, it was a\u000a"prison drama" and women don't like those, it contained almost no\u000aaction, it starred actors who were respected but not big stars, and it\u000awas long at 142 minutes. Polls and rentals reflect popularity but don't\u000aexplain why people value "Shawshank" so fervently. Maybe it plays more\u000alike a spiritual experience than a movie. It does have entertaining\u000apayoff moments (as when the guards from another prison, wearing their\u000abaseball uniforms, line up to have Andy do their taxes). But much of\u000athe movie involves quiet, solitude, and philosophical discussions about\u000alife. The moments of violence (as when Andy is sexually assaulted) are\u000aseen objectively, not exploited.The movie avoids lingering on Andy's suffering; after beatings, he's\u000aseen in medium and long shot, tactfully. The camera doesn't focus on\u000aAndy's wounds or bruises, but, like his fellow prisoners, gives him his\u000aspace.The Morgan Freeman character is carrier of the film's spiritual arc. We\u000asee him at three parole hearings, after 20, 30 and 40 years. The first\u000ahearing involves storytelling trickery; the film has opened with Andy's\u000asentencing, and then we see a parole board, and expect it's about to\u000alisten to Andy's appeal. But, no, that's when we first see Red. In his\u000afirst appeal he tries to convince the board he's been rehabilitated. In\u000athe second, he just goes through the motions.There's an underlying problem. Behind bars, Red is king. He's the\u000aprison fixer, able to get you a pack of cigarettes, a little rock pick\u000aor a Rita Hayworth poster. On the outside, he has no status or\u000aidentity. We've already seen what happened to the old librarian (James\u000aWhitmore), lonely and adrift in freedom.Frank Darabont wrote and directed the film, basing it on a story by\u000aStephen King. His film grants itself a leisure that most films are\u000aafraid to risk. The movie is as deliberate, considered and thoughtful\u000aas Freeman's narration. There's a feeling in Hollywood that audiences\u000ahave short attention spans and must be assaulted with fresh novelties.Tim Robbins makes Andy a man of few words, quietly spoken. He doesn't\u000aget real worked up. He is his own man, capable of keeping his head down\u000afor years and then indulging in a grand gesture, as when he plays an\u000aaria from Mozart's "The Marriage of Figaro." (The overhead shot of the\u000aprisoners in the yard, spellbound by the music, is one of the film's\u000aepiphanies.) Because he does not volunteer himself, reach out to us or\u000aoverplay his feelings, he becomes more fascinating: It is often better\u000ato wonder what a character is thinking than to know.Darabont constructs the film to observe the story, not to punch it up\u000aor upstage it. Upstaging, in fact, is unknown in this film; the actors\u000aare content to stay within their roles, the story moves in an orderly\u000away, and the film itself reflects the slow passage of the decades.\u000a"When they put you in that cell," Red says, "when those bars slam home,\u000athat's when you know it's for real. Old life blown away in the blink of\u000aan eye. Nothing left but all the time in the world to think about it."\u000aWatching the film again, I admired it even more than the first time I\u000asaw it. Affection for good films often grows with familiarity, as it\u000adoes with music. Some have said life is a prison, we are Red, Andy is\u000aour redeemer. All good art is about something deeper than it admits.\u000a

V\u000aThis movie blow my mind, i love the character of Andy and his friend\u000aRed, i like the he overcome his problems and keep in mind his goal\u000afreedom. Love how he make all the plan to brake out form jail. i think\u000ais really cool the as always all runaways go and hide in Mexico. Like\u000athe idea of going to Zihuatanejo beach and build a ship and go travel\u000aall pacific Mexican cost. Andy was a really Smart man and i think this\u000amove shows how you can pass all bad things in life if you have a goal,\u000aand look for it. The only i didn't like was the fact the nobody prove\u000athe Andy was Innocent of killing his wife. or maybe he did, i think\u000aAndy find out the she was cheating on him and he plan the crime with\u000athe same method he plan his scape of prison, who knows?\u000a

V\u000aI have never seen such an amazing film since I saw The Shawshank\u000aRedemption. Shawshank encompasses friendships, hardships, hopes, and\u000adreams. And what is so great about the movie is that it moves you, it\u000agives you hope. Even though the circumstances between the characters\u000aand the viewers are quite different, you don't feel that far removed\u000afrom what the characters are going through.It is a simple film, yet it has an everlasting message. Frank Darabont\u000adidn't need to put any kind of outlandish special effects to get us to\u000alove this film, the narration and the acting does that for him. Why\u000athis movie didn't win all seven Oscars is beyond me, but don't let that\u000asway you to not see this film, let its ranking on the IMDb's top 250\u000alist sway you, let your friends recommendation about the movie sway\u000ayou.Set aside a little over two hours tonight and rent this movie. You will\u000afinally understand what everyone is talking about and you will\u000aunderstand why this is my all time favorite movie.\u000a

Tim\u000aRobbins and Morgan Freeman carry the movie, but Bob Gunton and Clancy\u000aBrown are perfect as the Warden Norton and prison guard captain Hadley\u000arespectively. And James Whitmore's portrayal of an elderly inmate\u000aBrooks is moving. The screenplay gives almost every actor at least one\u000aor more memorable lines through out the film. As well as a very\u000asurprising "twist" near the end that almost knocked me out of my chair.\u000aIf you have not seen this movie rent it or better yet buy it. As I bet\u000ayou'll want to see this one more than once.\u000a

V\u000a*** This review may contain spoilers ***The Shawshank Redemption is without a doubt one of the most brilliant\u000amovies I have ever seen. Similar to The Green Mile in many respects\u000a(and better than it in almost all of them), these two movies have shown\u000aus that Stephen King is a master not only of horror but also of prose\u000athat shakes the soul and moves the heart. The plot is average, but King\u000adid great things with it in his novella that are only furthered by the\u000adirection, and the acting is so top-rate it's almost scary.Tim Robbins plays Andy Dufrane, wrongly imprisoned for 20 years for the\u000amurder of his wife. The story focuses on Andy's relationship with "Red"\u000aRedding (Morgan Freeman, in probably his best role) and his attempts to\u000aescape from Shawshank. Bob Gunton is positively evil and frightening as\u000aWarden Norton, and there are great performances and cameos all around;\u000athe most prominent one being Gil Bellows (late as Billy of Ally McBeal)\u000aas Tommy, a fellow inmate of Andy's who suffers under the iron will of\u000aNorton.If you haven't seen this movie, GO AND RENT IT NOW. You will not be\u000adisappointed. It is positively the best movie of the '90's, and one of\u000amy Top 3 of all time. This movie is a spectacle to move the mind, soul,\u000aand heart. 10/10\u000a

V\u000aParents need to know that this movie is rated R for a reason: The\u000agritty world of Shawshank Prison is populated with sadistic guards, a\u000acorrupt warden, and predatory fellow inmates. Two characters have sex\u000a(their clothes are on, and it's not graphic), one lovable character\u000ahangs himself, guards shoot an inmate and frame it as an escape\u000aattempt, inmates attempt and, we are told, succeed in raping Andy, and\u000aguards beat and kill an inmate in the opening scenes. But the film also\u000ashows inmates forming a loving community of friendship and support\u000adespite oppressive conditions.This is a truly the most beautiful movie\u000ai've ever seen.

V\u000aWell-acted, well-directed, powerful and thought-provoking, The\u000aShawshank Redemption encompasses all of the above, as it tells the\u000aincredibly inspiring story of friendship and hope. Both Tim Robbins and\u000aMorgan Freeman shine in their roles as inmates who develop a remarkable\u000abond during their imprisonment, facing the struggles of prison life\u000atogether and ultimately finding redemption. Although it focuses on a\u000avery familiar theme, The Shawshank Redemption stands out from the rest\u000aof the films in its genre, mainly due to the extremely intimate\u000aportrayal of its characters it has to offer. The film successfully uses\u000aits prison setting as a lens for society, and manages to present the\u000aaudience with important life lessons throughout the storyline. Although\u000anot designed as a film of epic proportions, its nature does have an\u000aimmense emotional impact on the viewer, which makes The Shawshank\u000aRedemption one of the greatest films of all time.\u000a

V\u000aThis is simply one of the best films ever made and I know I am not the\u000afirst to say that and I certainly won't be the last. The standing on\u000athe IMDb is a true barometer of that. #3 as of this date and I'm sure\u000ait could be number 1. So I'll just skip all the normal praise of the\u000afilm because we all know how great it is. But let me perhaps add that\u000awhat I find so fascinating about Shawshank is that Stephen King wrote\u000ait.King is one of the best writers in the world. Books like IT and the\u000aCastle Rock series are some of the greatest stories ever told. But his\u000abest adaptations are always done by the best directors. The Shining was\u000abrilliantly interpreted by Kubrick and of course the aforementioned\u000aMisery and Stand By Me are both by Rob Reiner. Now Frank Darabont comes\u000aonto the scene and makes arguably the best King film ever. He seems to\u000aunderstand what King wants to say and he conveys that beautifully. What makes this film one of the best ever made is the message it\u000aconveys. It is one of eternal hope. Andy Dufresne, played by Tim\u000aRobbins, has been sent to prison for a crime he did not commit. But he\u000anever loses hope. He never gives up his quest to become a free man\u000aagain. His years of tenacity, patience and wits keep him not only sane,\u000abut it gives his mind and a spirit a will to live. This film has a\u000adifferent feel to it. There has never been anything like it before and\u000aI don't know if there will again.\u000a

V\u000aThis movie title is nothing like the movie. Keep in mind that the movie\u000awas based on a book by Stephen King. For a fan of King this is not\u000asomething that you would expect. The movie has very little action in\u000ait, but is about true redemption, which is not revealed until the end\u000aof the movie. Personally I love this movie. The way that the cast\u000ainteracts with each other is really what gives this movie the flare\u000athat you need. The prison that it was filmed at is a real prison\u000alocated in Mansfield, Ohio. It can actually be toured by the general\u000apublic, as can other aspects of the movie. This is a definite must see\u000amovie for anyone who wants something that will make them think about\u000awhat is important in life.\u000a

Excellent cast, director and\u000aphotographer. This is my favorite movie. I watch this movie at least\u000atwice in every year and still love it. Morgan Freeman and Tim Robbins\u000abrilliantly play in it. They were very good choices for these\u000acharacters - even they are look like totally different as the book's\u000acharacters. I think they really enjoy to play their movie characters.\u000aBefore I have seen this movie someone said to me, it is only a newer\u000a"prison story". Yes, basically it is "only" a prison story. But there\u000ais nothing similar to The Shawshank Redemption! I can offer this movie\u000ato anyone who like well written stories with very good acting and very\u000agood directing.\u000a

V\u000aOne of those bores that liked it before all the hoopla...remember\u000agetting to watch as I'd read the Stephen King short story in the\u000acollection of novella's* of which it was part (which I had only read as\u000ait contained the short story 'the Body' which was turned into my\u000aprevious favourite film, Stand by Me) Upon watching what I thought was an astonishing film on video, I\u000awondered why I hadn't heard of this being at the cinema or talked\u000aabout....although I say that latter point now...it's probably something\u000athat has developed over time... much like the buzz for the film\u000aitself... I can say it remains to this day the only film that I have\u000awatched after reading the story, that is much better and more poignant\u000athan the book from which it came. The film itself is told in a great way and filmed brilliantly...not\u000aleast captured by the character of the warden (depicting what were 3 in\u000athe novella). It is full of great supporting characters and turns and\u000athere are two brilliant male leads (they both should've have got an\u000aOscar nomination with one of them winning!). It's a film where if I\u000astarted writing about the components of, or scenes from, I could go on\u000aFor longer than the film itself...(which despite its length never felt\u000alike a long movie!) So will just say that I'd recommend watching it to\u000aanyone. I've watched it copious times since first viewing and it never\u000agets boring or do I seem to switch off when it's on...so a boring\u000achoice of favourite film, but it really is a great movie.10/10* the collection (4 seasons) of short stories also contains Apt Pupil,\u000awhich is probably the best of the novella's but was turned into a\u000apretty average movie!\u000a

V\u000aA must watch from start to finish this movie has you glued to your seat\u000aand you actually care and hate some character's. if you like jail\u000amovies it is a great one and the acting is top notch . There are not\u000amany movies out there that can come close to the quality and excellence\u000aof this one from the story to the backgrounds and all the little\u000adetails . Do your self a service and go and watch it I am sure you wont\u000aregret the 3hr length (give or take). g how they were handling their\u000apublishing duties. Selected media members were allowed to play the\u000atitle, the amount of players at once was cut in half near release, and\u000areview copies were shipped out just in time for the release of the\u000aphysical copies of the game. All of this is just speculation on the\u000aquality of the title, but after playing Borderlands 2, it makes sense.\u000aEven with the Ce-shaded art style being very flattering for weaker\u000ahardware, the game still had serious issues that could not be patched\u000aup in time for release. The frame rate is almost always below 30fps,\u000aand rarely ever stabilizes unless you were to go to a vacant area and\u000ajust stand there. Sometimes, the game cannot process everything\u000ahappening on the screen, and the entire game freezes for around 1-2\u000aseconds.

V\u000aOne of the best movies I have ever seen! A brilliant performance, a\u000alife story and the perseverance of achieving your goals! A story about\u000aa man imprisoned for killing his wife becomes the true example of the\u000asaying that "not the strongest or the most intelligent survives,\u000asurvives the one who adapts". An intelligent person that takes patience\u000aand perseverance on this way to freedom. A very calculated plan of\u000aescape that takes place over a number of years. A movie that I see\u000aevery time with that same passion and pleasure. And the voice of Morgan\u000aFreeman always makes me feel in the middle of the story with every\u000aemotional state that comes with it.\u000a

V\u000areally its a great movie.......... It is a strange comment to make\u000aabout a film set inside a prison, but "The Shawshank Redemption"\u000acreates a warm hold on our feelings because it makes us a member of a\u000afamily. Many movies offer us vicarious experiences and quick,\u000asuperficial emotions. "Shawshank" slows down and looks. It uses the\u000anarrator's calm, observant voice to include us in the story of men who\u000ahave formed a community behind bars. It is deeper than most films;\u000aabout continuity in a lifetime, based on friendship and hope.Interesting that although the hero of the film is the convicted former\u000abanker Andy Dufresne (Tim Robbins), the action is never seen from his\u000apoint of view. The film's opening scene shows him being given two life\u000asentences for the murder of his wife and her lover, and then we move,\u000apermanently, to a point of view representing the prison population and\u000aparticularly the lifer Ellis 'Red' Redding (Morgan Freeman). It is his\u000avoice remembering the first time he saw Andy ("looked like a stiff\u000abreeze would blow him over"), and predicting, wrongly, that he wouldn't\u000amake it in prison.\u000a

V\u000aOne of the best movies I have ever seen. Its not something I would\u000atypically watch. Im not a huge fan of prison movies and there is very\u000alittle action. But every time it comes on TV, I end up completely\u000aengrossed in it.Its about a man who claims to be wrongly accused of murder going to\u000aprison. There he meets quite a few interesting characters who range\u000afrom actually criminal to sweet and naive. The main character is a well\u000aeducated accountant that uses his intelligence and determined demeanor\u000ato makes changes in the prison, including expanding the library and\u000adoing the wardens taxes. Even though he makes the place more\u000acomfortable for him and his fellow inmates, he is determined to never\u000aget "institutionalized" and keeps hope of getting out and back to the\u000areal world.\u000a

V\u000aGood film. Good Story. Fun Characters. Enticing plot. Escape plan is\u000awell though out. The warden is mean. Morgan Freeman does a fine job. I\u000aliked the movie. I may see it again. I would recommend it. A guys\u000amovie. Girls could enjoy it though. Info below is plot from\u000aWikipedia.The Shawshank Redemption is a 1994 American drama film\u000awritten and directed by Frank Darabont and starring Tim Robbins and\u000aMorgan Freeman. Adapted from the Stephen King novella Rita Hayworth and\u000aShawshank Redemption, the film tells the story of Andy Dufresne, a\u000abanker who spends 19 years in Shawshank State Prison for the murder of\u000ahis wife and her lover despite his claims of innocence. During his time\u000aat the prison, he befriends a fellow inmate, Ellis Boyd "Red" Redding,\u000aand finds himself protected by the guards after the warden begins using\u000ahim in his money laundering operation. Despite a lukewarm box office\u000areception that barely recouped its budget, the film received multiple\u000aaward nominations and favorable reviews from critics for its acting and\u000arealism. It has since enjoyed a remarkable life on cable television,\u000aVHS, DVD, and Blu-ray. It was included in the American Film Institute's\u000a100 Years...100 Movies 10th Anniversary Edition.\u000a

I have gone\u000athrough The Count of Monte Cristo ; after reading the book of course,\u000athat also is inline in some way with the movie; also Escape is one of\u000aits kind; The sharpness of mind and the direction or goal through which\u000athe hero goes gives sharp example of focus and patience. Shawshank\u000aRedemption is The Best movie of all , best part perhaps is the\u000adiscovery of the tunnel, it is and will be one of my most favored and\u000abeloved movies.Only sad part is that I don't see movies like these in\u000aair frequently, also could only know the name of the movie through a\u000afriend of mine.\u000a

V\u000aTim Robbins and Morgan Freeman, in the same movie. Does one need to say more? Morgan Freeman leads this all star cast on and interesting journey of\u000athe 1930's to 1950's prison system.The story has been told is such a way that you feel as if you are\u000aactually there to see the events take place.There are tears of joy and laughter, tears of sadness at the injustice.This is a movie that requires some patience but have no fear if you pay\u000aattention the twists and turns will be plain to see.Tim Robbins is magnificent as a jilted husband who is wrongly accused\u000aof his wife's murder.Morgan Freeman is there a movie in which this man doesn't do well in?\u000aHe is brilliant as an old con who is in Shawshank for murder.Overall this is a brilliant movie and delivers on all counts.\u000a

V\u000aIt's a poignant story about hope. Hope gets me. That's what makes a\u000afilm like this more than a movie. It tells a lesson about life. Those\u000aare the films people talk about 50 or even 100 years from you. It's\u000aalso a story for freedom. Freedom from isolation, from rule, from\u000abigotry and hate. Freeman and Robbins are majestic in their\u000aperformances. Each learns from the other. Their relationship is strong\u000aand you feel that from the first moment they make contact with one\u000aanother. There is also a wonderful performance from legend James\u000aWhitmore as Brooks.Several exterior scenes were shot at the Malabar Farm State Park, in\u000anearby Lucas, Ohio. The sequence in which Andy is parked outside his\u000ahome contemplating murdering his wife was filmed at the Pugh Cabin\u000awithin the park.The Shawshank Redemption was filmed in and around the city of\u000aMansfield, Ohio, located in north-central Ohio. The prison featured in\u000athe film is the old Ohio State Reformatory immediately north of down\u000atown Mansfield.The sequences representing the village of Buxton and the field where\u000aRed finds Andy's hidden letter were filmed on private land located\u000aopposite the park entrance on Bromfield Road. The oak tree is clearly\u000avisible from the roadside. The adjacent rock wall, which was\u000aconstructed specifically for the film, is located on the far side of\u000athe hill away from the roadside. The wall is still standing, although\u000ait has been somewhat eroded. Other scenes were shot in Ashland, Ohio,\u000aButler, Ohio, Upper Sandusky, Ohio and Portland, Maine.The two scenes in Mexico were filmed on the Island of St. Croix in the\u000aU.S. Virgin Islands. The first scene where Andy was driving a\u000aconvertible on a road along the Pacific Coast with the top down is\u000aroute 73 on the north side of St. Croix between Salt River (where\u000aChristopher Columbus landed in 1493) and Cane Bay.The second scene was the last scene of the movie. Red was walking on a\u000abeach toward his friend Andy while he worked on repairs to a boat on\u000athe beach. That was filmed at Sandy Point National Wildlife Refuge on\u000athe south west point of St.Croix.\u000a

V\u000a"The Shawshank Redemption" isn't a sad story, although you may think it\u000ais. There is a lot of feelings in it, like life and humor, and warmth\u000ain the friendship that builds up between Andy and Red. There is even\u000aexcitement and suspense, although not when we expect it. But mostly the\u000afilm is an allegory about sustain a sense of personal value,\u000anotwithstanding everything. If the film is perhaps a little slow in its\u000amiddle passages, maybe that is part of the idea too, to give us a sense\u000aof the leaden passage of time, before the glory of the final\u000aredemption. I truly recommend that you watch this movie, because, for\u000ame, is the best movie ever made\u000a

V\u000aTim Robbins and Morgan Freeman are inspirational as Andy and Red. I\u000ahave seen this movie about 30 times, maybe more. This film is full of\u000asurprises. It keeps you guessing about Andy's guilt until the end. The\u000aprison escape reminded me of the Count of Monte Cristo so it was\u000aespecially funny that this Dumas book was mentioned in the movie. It is\u000aa great film about institutionalization. It also is a good\u000arepresentation of prison life in its time period. It would make a great\u000afilm to watch for a Criminal Justice class. This is a must see movie\u000afor anyone who thinks their life has turned out bad. It can always be\u000aworse.In Andy's case it was.\u000a

V\u000aThe plot is very creative. The part when Andy finally escapes and\u000athroughout the whole movie he digging a tunnel to escape. I also enjoy\u000athe parody on the TV show "Family Guy". If you have Netflix check it\u000aout. The episode is called "Three Kings". It also contains wonderful\u000aparody's of King's other wonderful work "Misery", "Stand by Me", and\u000aalso hints at the masterpiece "The Shining". They do a great job on\u000a"Shawshank" and the rest of the stories and they stick to the story\u000alines and change so few very things. Just a few names (To fit the TV\u000ashow) and a little of the story line to spice things up and make less\u000adepressing and little more funny. King is at his best here and has only\u000areached this kind of high point few times before.\u000a

V\u000awhat a movie..! amazing chemistry.The ugly realities of prison life are\u000aquickly introduced to Andy: a corrupt warden (Bob Gunton), sadistic\u000aguards led by Capt. Byron Hadley (Clancy Brown), and inmates who are\u000alittle better than animals, willing to use rape or beatings to insure\u000atheir dominance. But Andy does not crack: he has the hope of the truly\u000ainnocent, which (together with his smarts) allow him to prevail behind\u000abars. He uses his banking skills to win favor with the warden and the\u000aguards, doing the books for Norton's illegal business schemes and\u000akeeping an eye on the investments of most of the prison staff. In\u000aexchange, he is able to improve the prison library and bring some\u000adignity and respect back to many of the inmates, including Red. Based\u000aon a story by Stephen King.\u000a

I've\u000aheard about all the actors who were considered for the roles of Andy\u000aand Red and I cannot think of anyone else in them but Tim Robbins and\u000aMorgan Freeman, they were so good.

V\u000aThe Shawshank Redemption is so much more then just a "prison movie".\u000aIndeed a majority of the film takes place in the drab, cold, depressing\u000aworld of a prison which sets the tone and the stage for the vibrant\u000acharacters Frank Darabont directs on screen. This is where the movie\u000ashines. It's about hope, loyalty, survival and most importantly,\u000afriendship. Andy Defresne and Red (Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman) put on a\u000aspectacle in this film, the way they present their characters, the yin\u000aand yang of the two is one of the most incredible acting duo's put on\u000acelluloid. The film begins with Andy being the one that needs Red, yet\u000ain the final act of the film, we see just how much the two need each\u000aother. The supporting cast is also brilliant. One of the late, great James\u000aWhitmores final great films. I simply cannot do this film justice with words. It's one of those\u000afilms that needs to be seen at least once. One of the great travesty's\u000ais that this film did not win best picture in 1995 or any of the other\u000aawards it was nominated for. Not to take away from Forrest Gump, but\u000athe Shawshank Redemption simply blew it out of the water.\u000a

V\u000aThis review contains spoilers, so spoiler alert!!! This film draws you\u000ain from the very beginning; from Tim Robins character coming home\u000acatching his wife cheating, to her being murdered. The theme is similar\u000ato the movie the Fugitive to me, the only difference was in the film\u000athe Fugitive, Harrison Fords character ran in the beginning, in Shaw\u000aShank Redemption, Tim Robins Character runs towards the end, after he\u000asuffers abuse being locked up with hardened criminals in prison. I felt\u000asorry for Tim Robins character being falsely accused and having to\u000asuffer rape, false imprisonment and lost years. One stand out theme to\u000ame in watching this film is you can imprison the man, but you cannot\u000aimprison his mind. Tim Robins Character was locked up for years but his\u000amind was free, instead of living inside the prison, Tim Robins\u000aCharacter lives inside his head remembering he is good with numbers and\u000aaccounting and living inside his head instead of his bad circumstances\u000awas his characters saving grace in this film. I would definitely\u000arecommend people watch this movie. If you are going through pain,\u000asometimes it helps to see other people going through stuff more worse\u000athan you and survive, become a victor instead of a victim, and for that\u000athis is my favorite Tim Robins film. Morgan Freeman, was Morgan\u000aFreeman, even as a supporting cast he made you feel his presence, his\u000avoice, the way he chooses his words makes you can't take your eyes off\u000ahim. He makes you feel his pain and his friendship with Tim Robins\u000aCharacter. This is a film I can see myself watching again and again\u000awhen I'm having a bad day. Hope this review helps. Now go watch this\u000amovie.\u000a

V\u000aThis film was very inspirational and spiritual and I really enjoyed it.\u000aIt truly demonstrated how difficult life was back then. It was well\u000awritten and well produced. The acting that was demonstrated was\u000atremendous. I truly enjoyed watching this film. The film Shawshank\u000aRedemption conveys to the audience the image of hope in the worst\u000apossible situation. Through the themes and the cinematic decisions\u000aapplied in these two episodes the director has made these vital to the\u000aunderstanding of the movie. He has given two examples of the extreme\u000asituations to which prisoners go depending on their emotions. One of\u000athe emotions is yet one of the main themes of the movie, hope, and in\u000amy opinion it has been brought up extremely effectively.\u000a

V\u000aThe Shawshank Redemption is a film about a man named Andy Defresne,\u000aplayed by Tim Robbins, who goes through the struggles of an innocent\u000aeducated man going to prison. Along the way, Andy learns what it takes\u000ato live comfortably in prison and makes a few friends along the way.\u000aAndy's best friend becomes Ellis Redding (Red), played by Morgan\u000aFreeman. Eventually, Andy discovers that a man has admitted to killing\u000ahis wife and her lover and becomes annoyed that he is forced to stay in\u000aprison. Andy then creates an elaborate plan of escape and a way to live\u000awell after that. The main theme to this film would be the importance of freedom and\u000afriendship. It was freedom that drove Andy. Andy missed the simpler\u000athings in life and tried to bring them to the prison. Andy missed being\u000aable to have a drink with his friends, he missed the sound of music, he\u000amissed making a difference in the world. As a high up banker, Andy had\u000amany responsibilities but in prison he started out as just he laundry\u000aguy. Later, Andy forced himself to be the warden's personal accountant.\u000aBut it was friendship that helps push Andy along. Without the friends\u000ahe makes along the way, Andy would have been all alone and would have\u000aprobably died not much longer. Andy's best friend, Red, was his\u000agreatest point of motivation. Red was comfortable in prison and knew\u000ahow to live well by prison standards. But Red also knew how to be a\u000adecent person after being in prison for so long. Red was Andy's escape\u000afrom the savage ways of the other prison mates. A similar film with the same themes would be "The Patriot". This film\u000ahas the same freedom theme as Shawshank. The characters in "The\u000aPatriot" are all fighting for freedom. They feel as if England has\u000aoppressed them long enough and wish to be free men. The same feeling is\u000afelt in Shawshank. Andy is feeling oppressed by the guards and the\u000asisters pushing him around that he wants a change. Andy's strategy is\u000aless dramatic because he is only one man, but the drive and emotional\u000atoll is still there. "Shawshank Redemption" is such a great film for many reasons. But the\u000atechnique that makes it such a great film is the sound. It is so simple\u000abecause there is no background sounds in this film. There are not any\u000adramatic music scenes to help pull us in the film. The reason for this\u000ais because prison is a scary thing and to scare the audience more, all\u000athey had to do is let us listen to someone get beat up in the middle of\u000aa cold concrete floor. This helps us want freedom for Andy and Red. It\u000awants us to help them escape.\u000a

V\u000aSimply dumbstruck an no wonder why this movie tops the IMDb List for\u000athese long years. Its simple awesome to look at the simplicity and the\u000ascreen play. The best casting and acting. At some point of time I\u000astarted to look around and realized that I am still at my home. No odd\u000ascenes, dialog, character).. My only concern is why its 9.2/10 ( why is\u000athe remaining(.8)% of people voted below 10?, because they are called\u000aas Morons....The best part is that, the director or the film crew is\u000anot so greedy to shoot a prequel or sequel after the massive success of\u000athis film. Hats off, and that is the real victory of the movie. This is\u000amy first review and I am forced to write 10 Lines of text.Sorry guys!!\u000a

V\u000aAmir Johnson does a funny thing when you tell him his true value on a\u000abasketball court.The Toronto Raptors forward, long the darling of the NBA's stat heads,\u000aseems like a modest guy. The night before he gave an interview in\u000aToronto this month, he had appeared as a guest judge on Canada's\u000aversion of "Top Chef." He might have been fine talking about food\u000ainstead of basketball; in fact, when a visiting radio host took Johnson\u000aaside earlier in the day, the host seemed to care little about the\u000ateam's first playoff appearance since 2008. Instead, for an on-air bit,\u000ahe cajoled Johnson into singing the Backstreet Boys instead of his\u000ateammates' praises.But now the topic at hand is this: Johnson is worth a ton to the\u000aRaptors, who tied their first-round playoff series with the Nets at two\u000agames apiece Sunday night in Brooklyn. At just 26 years old, he's never\u000amade an All-Star team -- hasn't even come close. Not once in his nine\u000aseasons has he averaged more than 11 points or 7.5 rebounds per game.\u000aSometimes, he doesn't even start. Yet there is a large sect of league\u000afollowers that consider Johnson among the most valuable, efficient and\u000airreplaceable players in the NBA.When he is told this, Johnson pulls a hand toward his face and cups it\u000awith his palm. He shields himself from view for an instant, turning his\u000ahead down, away from a reporter, and to the floor. But there is a smile\u000athere, too.\u000a

V\u000aWhen I saw this movie , I really become a fan . what a story and how it\u000ais composed this is awesome. The lesson of the story is too wide that\u000awhen you actually do something with zeal and zest then you can achieve\u000ait. Morgan Freeman , what a actor he is.Tim Robbins, one of our best,\u000amost casual, young actors, plays a banker in the 1940's who is falsely\u000asent to Shawshank Prison for the death of his wife and her lover. In\u000athis maximum security penitentiary, Robbins is harassed by the warden,\u000abeaten by guards, and sexually abused by inmates. The first and best\u000afriend he makes is the elder statesman of the yard, a long time convict\u000aplayed by the great Morgan Freeman. Over time, Robbins will make other\u000afriends, some of whom will be absolutely paralyzed by freedom in the\u000astraight world. Even better than "Birdman of Alcatraz," "The Shawshank\u000aRedemption" creates the world of overbearing closure that is prison.\u000a

V\u000athis is one of the greatest movies of all time. in my opinion its the\u000asecond best movie ever. everything is great about this movie the only\u000athing i hate about this movie are the many clichés. like the maggot he\u000afound in his food the prison rapes, black-white guy friendship. every\u000ascene is perfectly shot. the acting is perfect. the story is brilliant.\u000aand every character is perfectly developed. i recommend every French\u000aand Germany dude to watch this movie in the Original language. it may\u000abe not you're favorite genre, but you can't deny that this is a great\u000amovie. i agree it is a bit overrated but thats not a reason to give\u000athis movie 1/10. if you rate this movie below 8 you're not human.\u000a

V\u000aThis is an excellent work. For a movie that doesn't have much drama,\u000abut has so realistic details, I was captivated. The performances are\u000aepic. Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman has done one of the finest work of\u000aacting. The plot was not the most unique or unusual, but the work was\u000aHomeric, by that I mean it is monumental. This is one of those movies\u000athat will put you to think, that how patience can yield you fruits and\u000ahow impatience and wrath can put you to jail. His anger made him do\u000asomething (though he didn't do it) but he did act towards killing his\u000awife, which lead him to jail. And later the patience was the only key\u000afor success, and he did manage to get away from that jail.by working\u000ahard for it. A must watch.\u000a

V\u000aI get nightmares where I think Morgan Freeman is narrating in my head\u000aand I can't turn him off. For me, his condescending delivery which\u000apeels back of the top layer of the man onion, defines this film, and so\u000ait starts to lose me a bit. This is a really good story but so much of\u000athe film is made up of episodes of over the top male bonding. I find it\u000aastonishing that it rates so highly to be honest. I also have a problem\u000awith the plethora of goofs. Why do the contents of an atmospheric\u000asewerage line explode upon the breaking of its pipe with a brick? Like\u000athat would work anyway. And why place a boat that you want to paint\u000apaint right on the edge of the sea as the moment the tide comes in it\u000awill simply float away? And how did our protagonist get the poster\u000astuck back once he went through his escape tunnel in the wall? There\u000aare so many stupid parts to it. I enjoyed it generally though, as I say\u000aits a good yarn - but the best film ever! Best film ever for males with\u000aIQs under 80 perhaps. I could believe that.\u000a

V\u000aI had heard a lot about the movie before seeing it..And I would wonder\u000awhat would be so great about a prison movie.. But now after seeing it,\u000ai can say it is the best movie I've ever seen.. This is how movies\u000ashould be.. And it proves that no special effects, technology,\u000acostumes, locations can substitute for good story and acting. I have\u000anever been so moved or influenced by any movie as I have by this\u000aone..It leaves you with a sense of happiness and deep satisfaction.. It\u000ais a thought provoking and emotionally uplifting movie which teaches us\u000aso much about life, hope, friendship..It has some memorable lines which\u000areally create an impact.. Acting by all actors is top notch.. Too sad\u000athe movie did not win a single Oscar.. The no.1 spot on IMDb is very\u000awell deserved.. It is timeless classic which will be remembered for\u000ayears to come.\u000a

V\u000aTalk about not getting it. The clue to just how badly the reviewer\u000amissed lies in the title. The theme is REDEMPTION, not hope or\u000asentimental treacle or the evils of capital punishment and Rush\u000aLimbaugh. Further, it's a FANTASY, as close to Neal Gaiman as Stephen\u000aKing has ever come. (Hint: Fantasies aren't supposed to be real.) Nor\u000ais Andy Dufresne a Cooperesque character. Rather, he is written as\u000adiffident, difficult, and entirely unlovable at first blush. See my\u000anext. All these comments are funny. I'm glad Glieberman wrote this\u000areview. Everything he says about this overrated piece of goop is true.\u000aIt IS sentimental and exploitative, and makes prison seem trivial; who\u000acares about the rape if eventually I'll be redeemed, Hollywood style?\u000aThe characters are thinly portrayed, and it has little connection with\u000agrit or honesty. Along with Forrest Gump and Gone With The Wind, one of\u000athe most overpraised movies ever made.\u000a

V\u000aIn 1947, banker Andy Dufresne (Tim Robbins) is convicted of murdering\u000ahis wife and her lover, and sentenced to two consecutive life sentences\u000aat Shawshank State Penitentiary. Andy quickly befriends contraband\u000asmuggler Ellis "Red" Redding (Morgan Freeman), an inmate serving a life\u000asentence. Red procures a rock hammer for Andy, allowing him to create\u000asmall stone chess pieces. Red later gets him a large poster of Rita\u000aHayworth, followed in later years by images of Marilyn Monroe and\u000aRaquel Welch. Andy works in the prison laundry, but is regularly\u000aassaulted by the "bull queer" gang "the Sisters" and their leader, Bogs\u000a(Mark Rolston).In 1949, Andy overhears the brutal chief guard Byron Hadley (Clancy\u000aBrown) complaining about taxes on a forthcoming inheritance and informs\u000ahim about a financial loophole. After another vicious assault by the\u000aSisters nearly kills Andy, Hadley severely beats Bogs resulting in Bogs\u000abeing sent to another prison. Andy is not attacked again. Warden Samuel\u000aNorton (Bob Gunton) meets with Andy and reassigns him to the prison\u000alibrary to assist elderly inmate Brooks Hatlen (James Whitmore), a\u000apretext for Andy to manage financial duties for the prison. His advice\u000aand expertise are soon sought by other guards at Shawshank and from\u000anearby prisons. Andy begins writing weekly letters to the state\u000agovernment for funds to improve the decrepit library.In 1954, Brooks is freed on parole, but unable to adjust to the outside\u000aworld after 50 years in prison, he hangs himself. Andy receives a\u000alibrary donation that includes a recording of The Marriage of Figaro.\u000aHe plays an excerpt over the public address system, resulting in his\u000areceiving solitary confinement. After his release, Andy explains that\u000ahe holds onto hope as something that the prison cannot take from him,\u000abut Red dismisses the idea. In 1963, Norton begins exploiting prison\u000alabor for public works, profiting by undercutting skilled labor costs\u000aand receiving kickbacks. He has Andy launder the money using the alias\u000a"Randall Stephens".In 1965, Tommy Williams (Gil Bellows) is incarcerated for burglary. He\u000ajoins Andy's and Red's circle of friends, and Andy helps him pass his\u000aGeneral Educational Development (G.E.D.) examinations. In 1966, after\u000ahearing the details of Andy's case, Tommy reveals that an inmate at\u000aanother prison claimed responsibility for an identical murder,\u000asuggesting Andy's innocence. Andy approaches Norton with this\u000ainformation, but the warden refuses to listen. Norton places Andy in\u000asolitary confinement and has Hadley murder Tommy, under the guise of an\u000aescape attempt. Andy refuses to continue with the scam, but Norton\u000athreatens to destroy the library and take away his protection and\u000apreferential treatment. After Andy is released from solitary\u000aconfinement, he tells Red of his dream of living in Zihuatanejo, a\u000aMexican Pacific coastal town. While Red shrugs it off as being\u000aunrealistic, Andy instructs him, should he ever be freed, to visit a\u000aspecific hayfield near Buxton to retrieve a package. Red becomes\u000aconcerned with Andy's state of mind, particularly when he learns Andy\u000aasked another inmate to supply him with six feet of rope.The next day at roll call, upon finding Andy's cell empty, an irate\u000aNorton throws one of Andy's rocks at the poster of Raquel Welch hanging\u000aon the wall. The rock tears through the poster, revealing a tunnel that\u000aAndy had dug with his rock hammer over the previous two decades. The\u000aprevious night, Andy escaped through the tunnel and the prison's sewage\u000apipe with Norton's ledger, containing details of the money laundering.\u000aWhile guards search for him the following morning, Andy, posing as\u000aRandall Stephens, visits several banks to withdraw the laundered money.\u000aFinally, he sends the ledger and evidence of the corruption and murders\u000aat Shawshank to a local newspaper. The police arrive at Shawshank and\u000atake Hadley into custody, while Norton commits suicide to avoid arrest.After serving 40 years, Red receives parole. He struggles to adapt to\u000alife outside prison and fears he never will. Remembering his promise to\u000aAndy, he visits Buxton and finds a cache containing money and a letter\u000aasking him to come to Zihuatanejo. Red violates his parole and travels\u000ato Fort Hancock, Texas to cross the border to Mexico, admitting he\u000afinally feels hope. On a beach in Zihuatanejo, he finds Andy, and the\u000atwo friends are happily reunited.\u000a

V\u000aI voted 10 out of 10. This movie is truly inspiring. For me, the movie\u000asays NEVER GIVE UP and WHEN THERE IS A WILL, THERE IS A WAY. The actors\u000aportrayed their roles very well. I cannot believe it didn't do well the\u000away it should have compared to some non sense box office movies.I admired the kind of friendship Andy and Red had. I also admired the\u000away Andy made his way to earn the trust of the jail guards and fellow\u000ainmates. He is indeed an intelligent man and he used it to gain\u000asomething that he needed to free himself. I wish I have that kind of\u000aintelligence and persistence.The ending is really heartwarming. Seeing two old friends meeting again\u000aand ready to start over again. It is just sad that ex-cons are not\u000agiven the chance to start over nowadays.\u000a

V\u000aI loved that movie. I heard a lot of thing about the film but its\u000abetter than I thought. Everybody have to take a look then they cant get\u000atheir eyes off it...When it start you consider it a ordinary movie. But\u000astory is so touched. If you are an emotional person you cant help your\u000atears anymore. There are The successful performances first the starring\u000aMorgin Freeman and the another stars. It looks a desperate story but\u000aafter a half hour you can see hopeful movie. You even feel hopeful and\u000aoptimist when you finish the movie. And Its has the best final... You\u000acan see the darkness side of jail and you can see old men living a\u000achild inside, a child inside and never let him die . When you feel\u000aworst when you have no more choice you have yourself your hope and make\u000ayour own destiny. It was the message that I had from that movie...\u000a

V\u000aOne of my all time favorites. Shawshank Redemption is a very moving\u000astory about hope and the power of friendship. The cast is first rate\u000awith everyone giving a great performance. Tim Robbins and Morgan\u000aFreeman carry the movie, but Bob Gunton and Clancy Brown are perfect as\u000athe Warden Norton and prison guard captain Hadley respectively. And\u000aJames Whitmore's portrayal of an elderly inmate Brooks is moving. The\u000ascreenplay gives almost every actor at least one or more memorable\u000alines through out the film. As well as a very surprising "twist" near\u000athe end that almost knocked me out of my chair. If you have not seen\u000athis movie rent it or better yet buy it. As I bet you'll want to see\u000athis one more than once.\u000a

V\u000aas Carlfo Said.Why do I want to write the 234th comment on The Shawshank Redemption? I\u000aam not sure - almost everything that could be possibly said about it\u000ahas been said. But like so many other people who wrote comments, I was\u000aand am profoundly moved by this simple and eloquent depiction of hope\u000aand friendship and redemption. The only other movie I have ever seen that effects me as strongly is To\u000aKill a Mockingbird. Both movies leave me feeling cleaner for having\u000awatched them.I didn't intend to see this movie at all: I do not like prison movies\u000aand I don't normally watch them. I work at a branch library and one day\u000aas I was checking The Shawshank Redemption out to one of our older\u000apatrons, she said to me, "Whenever I feel down or depressed, I check\u000aout this movie and watch it and it always makes me feel better." At the\u000atime, I thought that was very strange. One day there was nothing on TV\u000aexcept things I absolutely would not watch under any circumstance or\u000athings that I had seen too many times already. I remembered what she\u000asaid, so I watched it. I have watched it many many times since then and\u000ait gets better with every showing.\u000a

V\u000aDarabont constructs the film to observe the story, not to punch it up\u000aor upstage it. Upstaging, in fact, is unknown in this film; the actors\u000aare content to stay within their roles, the story moves in an orderly\u000away, and the film itself reflects the slow passage of the decades.\u000a"When they put you in that cell," Red says, "when those bars slam home,\u000athat's when you know it's for real. Old life blown away in the blink of\u000aan eye. Nothing left but all the time in the world to think about it."\u000aWatching the film again, I admired it even more than the first time I\u000asaw it. Affection for good films often grows with familiarity, as it\u000adoes with music. Some have said life is a prison, we are Red, Andy is\u000aour redeemer. All good art is about something deeper than it admits.\u000a

The story is moved with a character of a banker,Andy\u000aDufresne , who was punished to go into Shawshank prison and his life\u000athere. He meets a person called Red there who is another main character\u000ain the movie. As the story go further it introduces new things of his\u000aprison life and keep interested in the movie. Tim Robbins and Morgan\u000aFreeman did a brilliant job,who are the main roles Andy Dufresne and\u000aRed in the movie.Besides, other actors were good as well. I felt the\u000asame feeling when I watched 'Forest Gump',which is also a favorite\u000amovie of mine. Finally, I just love the movie and would like to advise\u000aeveryone to watch it.\u000a

V\u000a'The Shawshank Redemption' is a brilliant adaptation, if only because\u000aDarabont has some quintessential scenes added. So Andy locks himself\u000ainside the library, while he plays opera music all over the courtyard.\u000aIn another sequence Darabont shows the suicide of an old freed prisoner\u000awho cant get used to the outside world. There are some smaller changes\u000ato the characters. Both in the book and the film Tommy Williams is the\u000ayoung rascal who tells Andy who really killed his wife. Andy gets\u000aexcited and gets a month of solitary confinement, but in the move\u000aWilliams is murdered.The film is quite a gem. He tastes like freedom on a silver blue bird.\u000aFreedom on a hot summer day. Freedom as "wander around the prison\u000agrounds like you can go to a cocktail party at anytime " Freedom after\u000aforty years' imprisonment. 'The Shawshank Redemption' colors the most\u000amorbid mind blue. The color of the sea, The color of Andy's freedom.\u000a

Iwas such an extraordinary\u000amemory and I will never forget it. If you haven't seen this movie well you should watch it right now. It's\u000aworth it !\u000a

V\u000aAmazing Film really loved it, would highly recommend the film to\u000asomeone who hasn't watched it great acting, amazing storyline, great\u000aperformances from Tim Robbins and Morgan freeman. I'm not really into\u000aprison movies that much but this is the best by far! great drama a must\u000awatch!. Firstly, its setting. The opening aerial shots of the prison\u000aare a total eye-opener. This is an amazing piece of architecture,\u000astrong and Gothic in design. Immediately, the prison becomes a\u000acharacter. It casts its shadow over most of the film, its tall stone\u000awalls stretching above every shot. It towers over the men it contains,\u000ablotting out all memories of the outside world. Only Andy (Robbins)\u000aholds onto hope. It's in music, it's in the sandy beaches of\u000aZihuatanejo; "In here's where you need it most," he says. "You need it\u000aso you don't forget. Forget that there are places in the world that\u000aaren't made out of stone. That there's a - there's a - there's\u000asomething inside that's yours, that they can't touch." Red (Morgan\u000aFreeman) doesn't think much of Andy at first, picking "that tall glass\u000ao' milk with the silver spoon up his ass" as the first new fish to\u000acrack. Andy says not a word, and losing his bet, Red resents him for\u000ait. But over time, as the two get to know each other, they quickly\u000abecome the best of friends. This again, is one of the film's major\u000astrengths. Many movies are about love, many flicks have a side-kick to\u000athe hero, but Shawshank is the only one I can think of that looks\u000ahonestly at the love between two best friends. It seems odd that\u000aHollywood would skip this relationship time and again, when it's a\u000afeeling that weighs so much into everyone's day to day lives. Perhaps\u000ait's too sentimental to seem conventional, but Shawshank's core\u000afriendship hits all the right notes, and the film is much better for\u000ait.\u000a

V\u000aThis is my ALL TIME FAVORITE movie ever. My children (whom also love\u000ait) will not watch it with me because I say the lines all the way\u000athrough. I LOVE Morgan Freeman's voice, just something very comforting\u000ato me, like home. The part where Red is describing how Andy got out\u000ajust fills my heart and to see Andy's smile at the end bring it full\u000acircle! If you like this I would suggest: Murder in the First (Kevin\u000aBacon) and The Last Castle (Robert Redford) both very different even\u000athough they are prison based and same era based movies they go in\u000adifferent directions. I do not live very far from the prison in SR. My\u000amom did some kind of day trip/tour there and bought a small hard bound\u000abook that had been used as a prop in the library scene (just sitting on\u000athe shelf with others not actually "used" in the movie)\u000a

V\u000aIt is a strange comment to make about a film set inside a prison, but\u000a"The Shawshank Redemption" creates a warm hold on our feelings because\u000ait makes us a member of a family. Many movies offer us vicarious\u000aexperiences and quick, superficial emotions. "Shawshank" slows down and\u000alooks. It uses the narrator's calm, observant voice to include us in\u000athe story of men who have formed a community behind bars. It is deeper\u000athan most films; about continuity in a lifetime, based on friendship\u000aand hope.Interesting that although the hero of the film is the convicted former\u000abanker Andy Dufresne (Tim Robbins), the action is never seen from his\u000apoint of view. The film's opening scene shows him being given two life\u000asentences for the murder of his wife and her lover, and then we move,\u000apermanently, to a point of view representing the prison population and\u000aparticularly the lifer Ellis 'Red' Redding (Morgan Freeman). It is his\u000avoice remembering the first time he saw Andy ("looked like a stiff\u000abreeze would blow him over"), and predicting, wrongly, that he wouldn't\u000amake it in prison. People like excitement at the movies, and titles\u000athat provide it do well. Films about "redemption" are approached with\u000agreat wariness; a lot of people are not thrilled by the prospect of a\u000agreat film - it sounds like work. But there's a hunger for messages of\u000ahope, and when a film offers one, it's likely to have staying power\u000aeven if it doesn't grab an immediate audience."The Shawshank Redemption" premiered at the Toronto Film Festival in\u000aSeptember 1994, and opened a few weeks later. It got good reviews but\u000adid poor business (its $18 million original gross didn't cover costs;\u000ait took in only another $10 million after winning seven Oscar\u000anominations, including best picture).\u000a

V\u000aThe Shawshank Redemption 'Two imprisoned men bond over a number of\u000ayears, finding solace and eventual redemption through acts of common\u000adecency.'So let me get straight to the point! Me searching for a good Morgan\u000aFreeman movie as you know he is a good actor and I've near enough\u000awatched every movie that he has been in. The tag-line said it all\u000areally 'Fear can hold you prisoner. Hope can set you free.' especially\u000athe ending scene where red found the letter quoting 'hope is a good\u000athing, maybe the best of things, and no good thing ever dies... your\u000afriend Andy.'The movie has absolutely got to be one of my favourite movies. The\u000aacting was superb. The story-line was great. The filming was good. You\u000ajust have to give credit to the director Frank Darabont for doing such\u000aan excellent job.\u000a

V\u000aThe whole movies are incredible but you'd hate the ending... Without a\u000asingle riot scene or horrific effect, it tells a slow, gentle story of\u000acamaraderie and growth, with an ending that abruptly finds poetic\u000ajustice in what has come before. The writer and director, Frank\u000aDarabont, tells this tale with a surprising degree of loving care.There are times when "The Shawshank Redemption" comes dangerously close\u000ato sounding one of those "triumph of the human spirit" notes. But most\u000aof it is eloquently restrained. Despite an excess of voice-over\u000anarration and inspirational music, Mr. Darabont's film has a genuine\u000adignity that holds the interest. It is helped greatly by fine,\u000acircumspect performances from Morgan Freeman as a rueful lifer named\u000aRed and Tim Robbins as Andy, the new kid on the cell-block. The film\u000aspans nearly 20 years of friendship between these two.\u000a

V\u000a"The Shawshank Redemption" is one of the best movies that I have ever\u000awatched. Each and every element of the movie comes together to form an\u000aexquisite cinematic story.Tim Robbins (Andy Dufresne) has plays his part to perfection and is\u000awell complimented by Morgan Freeman (Ellis "Red" Redding). Frank Darabont masterfully entwines fate, courage, fear, hardship,\u000afriendship, dreams and above all HOPE into one truly enticing cinematic\u000aexperience. The various phases in the movie are shown with so much\u000aemotion that it gives the viewer a sense of being actually there at\u000athat moment. The movie was nominated for seven Academy Awards in 1994 but walked\u000aaway with none which was very disheartening.\u000a

Even if this film doesn't stay true to\u000athe novel it is a fantastic film in its own right and deserves a place\u000ain any film collection whether it be a film buff or casual viewer, this\u000afilm is entertaining for all and incredibly re-watchable. A story that has been told a thousand times, a prison break... No\u000aprison break film has quite reached the caliber of The Shawshank\u000aRedemption and even by today's standards the film holds up as one of\u000athe greats. Not only does this film offer the performances of a life time by both\u000aMorgan Freeman (who was robbed at the 1995 Oscars)and Tim Robbins it is\u000atechnically brilliant offering some of the best work by cinematographer\u000aRoger Deakins, fantastic film editing and a marvelous score by Thomas\u000aNewman.The Shawshank Redemption holds the top spot of many people's favorite\u000afilm list's, and I can't say I blame them...

V\u000aOne of the finest films ever made, it has a storyline based on the\u000apower of friendship. The film is about Two imprisoned men and how they\u000abond over a number of years, finding solace and eventual redemption\u000athrough acts of common decency. It is a beautifully made film and\u000acredit should be given to director and writer Frank Darabont. The\u000aacting masterclass of Morgan Freeman and Tim Robbins helps create a\u000aheart-wrenching friendship as Andy Dufresne (Tim Robbins) struggles to\u000acope in Shawshank Prison as he has been wrongly accused for his wife's\u000amurder. In steps "Red" (Morgan Freeman) a man who knows how to get\u000athings who befriends Andy and learns about his story. This is one of my\u000aall-time favourites and rightly so. It is one that everyone should\u000awatch, a film where grit and determination, mixed with true friendship,\u000aalways helps you prevail in the most difficult of situations.\u000a

Tim Robbins has a performance of a lifetime and\u000athis movie propelled Morgan Freeman to the superstar he is today. A lot\u000aof twist and turns in the plot and all the supporting characters were\u000aamazing as well. Even with the bad guys, you really do invest each and\u000aevery one of them and the film just builds truly memorable characters\u000athrough the whole movie.

The reason I gave it a six is because it's\u000anot really challenging.

V\u000aAll Time Great Movie - rom Andy's arrival on the prison bus to the\u000afilm's end, we see only how others see him - Red, who becomes his best\u000afriend, Brooks the old librarian, the corrupt Warden Norton, guards and\u000aprisoners. Red is our surrogate. He's the one we identify with, and the\u000aredemption, when it comes, is Red's. We've been shown by Andy's example\u000athat you have to keep true to yourself, not lose hope, bide your time,\u000aset a quiet example and look for your chance. "I guess it comes down to\u000aa simple choice, really," he tells Red. "Get busy livin' or get busy\u000adyin'."The key to the film's structure, I think, is that it's not about its\u000ahero, but about our relationship with him - our curiosity, our pity,\u000aour admiration. If Andy had been the heroic center, bravely enduring,\u000athe film would have been conventional, and less mysterious. But we\u000awonder about this guy. Did he really kill those two people? Why does he\u000akeep so much to himself? Why can he amble through the prison yard like\u000aa free man on a stroll, when everyone else plods or sidles?People like excitement at the movies, and titles that provide it do\u000awell.

When Red is talking about how he\u000ahopes he will be able to cross the border and see Andy again, connoting\u000athe whole ending theme of the film and the bus drives into the\u000adistance.That's were they should have left it. Forget the end scene on the beach\u000awhere they embrace, lovely and uplifting, sure, but too kind.

V\u000aAnd I truly mean that. When I first saw this film, I was blown\u000aaway.With superb acting, superb story, perfect emotion and tone, and an\u000aincredible twist ending that still amazes me, this film is completely\u000aand utterly perfect. The film speaks of hope, and the film's two main\u000acharacters debate throughout the movie about it. One character believes\u000athat, in prison, hope is dangerous, and that it should not be used\u000abecause it will simply make life tougher. Another character believes\u000athat hope is needed, because it helps you to keep pushing for a better\u000atomorrow when one does not appear to be in sight.While very engaging and immensely entertaining, this film would not be\u000aheld to such high regards if not for the twist ending, which is one of\u000athe greatest movie endings of all time, in my opinion. If the ending is\u000amerely average, this film would simply be considered good, possibly\u000agreat, but not the masterpiece that it is today. And, watching it\u000arepeatedly makes the film even better, because experiencing the events\u000athat occur within the story makes the ending even greater.I can't speak for everybody, but this is a film that I can watch over\u000aand over again, and love it more each time I watch it. And, while I\u000asimply talked about the ending this entire review, that is not all that\u000amakes this film incredible. However, I will not waste any more of your\u000atime talking about how wonderful this film is. And please do not waste\u000aany of your own time. Find a way to see this movie as ASAP. It will be\u000atime well spent, and you will certainly see it multiple more times.\u000a

V\u000aI have never seen such an amazing film since I saw The Shawshank\u000aRedemption. Shawshank encompasses friendships, hardships, hopes, and\u000adreams. And what is so great about the movie is that it moves you, it\u000agives you hope. Even though the circumstances between the characters\u000aand the viewers are quite different, you don't feel that far removed\u000afrom what the characters are going through.Frank Darabont didn't need to put any kind of outlandish special\u000aeffects to get us to love this film, the narration and the acting does\u000athat for him. Set aside a little over two hours tonight and rent this movie. You will\u000afinally understand what everyone is talking about and you will\u000aunderstand why this is my all time favorite movie.\u000a

V\u000aAmazing story, great characters and very good actors. But only thing\u000athat i didn't like was make-up, for example Andy gets 20 years older\u000abut that chief guard doesn't older at all and same goes other\u000acharacters. Location is great, one of the best movie prisons i ever\u000aseen. So that is reason why i didn't give a ten, but 9,5 would\u000aappropriate. This film definitely deserved at least 3-4 Oscars. Best\u000aPicture, Best Actor in a Leading Role and Best Writing, Screenplay\u000aBased on Material Previously Produced or Published. Best Actor in a\u000aSupporting Role nomination at least. Finnish name for this movie\u000aterrible, it spoils the entire movie. One of the greatest stories of\u000aall time, you have see this.\u000a

V\u000aOne of the best movies that I've seen for a long time. Although for me\u000aThe Godfather is the best movie of all time. But, this movie has a\u000agreat unique story which makes it so interesting.I really like this movie, because it does show you that the system can\u000amake a mistake just like everyone can. All people make mistakes and\u000asince the government is run by humans of course there are going to be\u000aflaws. I had watched this movie for the first time with my dad and I\u000aloved watching it since. It does show that when you are determined you\u000acan do anything you put your mind to. I think anyone who likes movies\u000aabout prison or even about the judicial system will love this film.\u000a

V\u000aWhen this movie was released on video, yes VHS, my brother told my mom\u000ato watch it. So my mother asked me to watch it with her, most of the\u000astuff she had me watch were all good but I heard how long it was. I was\u000ahesitant at first. I thought I would be bored as hell. After the movie\u000awas over I could not believe how good it was. One of my favorites then\u000aand remains in my top 5 movies today. If anybody hasn't seen the movie\u000athen... 1) Where the hell have you been? Living under a rock? 2) Watch\u000ait already!

V\u000aFor Foucault, the prison is a creation, that is, in fact, an innovation\u000aperfected by reason of punishment since according to him, it was\u000aestablished with the aim of equipping a formation of more affective and\u000ausable individuals in society. This same instrument of punishment,\u000awhich is also an institution of kidnapping, it is contemplated in the\u000amovie "The Shawshank Redemption". In the film, one realizes that\u000aprison, as Foucault argued, is contradictory. This institution of\u000akidnapping, which is a reflection of modern society, has a higher\u000are-educative than punitive effect. What can be observed when one of the\u000acharacters gets his freedom after spending 50 years in prison, he,\u000ahowever, was not successful during its process of adaptation to the\u000aexternal mode of life and society, eventually undermining the very\u000alife.\u000a

V\u000aThe Shawshank Redemption is something of an oddity. Based on a Stephen\u000aKing novella Rita Hayworth and Shawshank Redemption, it has dominated\u000aIMDb's Top 250 list for years now and has often been regarded as one of\u000athe best films ever made. Almost every adult Westerner has seen the\u000amovie at some point during their lives, yet not all that many people\u000atalk about this film, at least in my experience. It's not often\u000arecommended to others like The Godfathers, it's not quoted as often as\u000aThe Dark Knight or Fight Club, it's not regarded as inherently cool as\u000aPulp Fiction. So what makes it so great then? In my opinion the answer\u000alies in its quality as a whole. It's not a flashy film. The pacing is\u000aslow as time itself - fitting for a prison film, admittedly - the\u000aconversations are often quiet and thoughtful, the prison setting never\u000achanges, but rather builds up in intensity and while there are emotions\u000aand deep themes displayed, they're not over the top or hammered in.\u000aRather they're subtle, real if you will.It's not a film that you will talk about a lot, but it's a movie that\u000awill stick with you. It's not a film that will leave you puzzled for\u000adays as you try to work through it's meanings, it's not a hard movie to\u000aunderstand, but you'll find yourself returning to it from time to time.\u000aAnd there are a lot of things to return to. The quiet dignity of Andy\u000aDufresne (Tim Robbins), the friendship between him and Red (Morgan\u000aFreeman), the other inmates, the brutality of the warden and the\u000aguards, that brilliant moment in the rain, the ending, the callbacks,\u000athe overarching and complex plot.The Shawshank Redemption is the jack of all trades of films. Not a\u000asingle element in it is the absolute best within cinema, but they're\u000aall way above average. Everything from the slightest camera angle to\u000athe main actors is up to par and beyond. Personally it's not my\u000afavourite movie of all time, I admit as much, but it's a masterpiece in\u000aits own right. I have nothing against it being the number one.\u000a

V\u000aTim Robbins plays Andy Dufresne, a city banker, wrongfully convicted of\u000amurdering his wife and her lover. He is sent to Shawshank Prison in\u000a1947 and receives a double life sentence for the crime. Andy forms an\u000aunlikely friendship with "Red" (Morgan Freeman), the man who knows how\u000ato get things. Andy faces many trials in prison, but forms an alliance\u000awith the wardens because he is able to use his banking experience to\u000ahelp the corrupt officials amass personal fortunes and the story\u000aunfolds from thereThe Shawshank Redemption is an aesthetic adaptation of a much repeated\u000acliché 'where there's a will, there's a way'. It is a monumental piece\u000aof art that can chill, thrill, excite and rejoice any type of audience.\u000aIt renders a remarkable story of hope, trust, courage, determination\u000aand friendship while at the same time exploring the not-so-pleasant\u000athemes of corruption and police brutality.\u000a

V\u000aThis movie the most one of the most greatest movies of all time in my\u000aopinion. It features great story, great characters as well as a amusing\u000aand sad plot. There are some sad moments in the movie like when the old\u000alibrarian hung himself because he couldn't live outside of the big\u000ahouse and so on. And there is some feel good moments like when Red got\u000areleased and when Andy escaped from the prison after twenty years. And\u000ait was very frustrating when the student Andy was teaching got shoot\u000abecause it would prove Andy innocent and for him to be set free. Andy\u000atries his best to fit into Shawshank prison by making little stone\u000astatues and a chess set. Where does he get the stone you ask? Well you\u000ahave to watch it and find out because it is the most genius plan that\u000aany prisoner has come up with to escape Shawshank. In conclusion I\u000awould absolutely recommend this to any fan of cinema, Steven King,\u000adrama, comedy or tragedy then this film is the best for you.\u000a

V\u000aI like that part when it turns out to be an action movie. And now, some\u000aLorem Ipsum to make the review longer:But I must explain to you how all this mistaken idea of denouncing\u000apleasure and praising pain was born and I will give you a complete\u000aaccount of the system, and expound the actual teachings of the great\u000aexplorer of the truth, the master-builder of human happiness. No one\u000arejects, dislikes, or avoids pleasure itself, because it is pleasure,\u000abut because those who do not know how to pursue pleasure rationally\u000aencounter consequences that are extremely painful. Nor again is there\u000aanyone who loves or pursues or desires to obtain pain of itself,\u000abecause it is pain, but because occasionally circumstances occur in\u000awhich toil and pain can procure him some great pleasure. To take a\u000atrivial example, which of us ever undertakes laborious physical\u000aexercise, except to obtain some advantage from it? But who has any\u000aright to find fault with a man who chooses to enjoy a pleasure that has\u000ano annoying consequences, or one who avoids a pain that produces no\u000aresultant pleasure?On the other hand, we denounce with righteous indignation and dislike\u000amen who are so beguiled and demoralized by the charms of pleasure of\u000athe moment, so blinded by desire, that they cannot foresee the pain and\u000atrouble that are bound to ensue; and equal blame belongs to those who\u000afail in their duty through weakness of will, which is the same as\u000asaying through shrinking from toil and pain. These cases are perfectly\u000asimple and easy to distinguish. In a free hour, when our power of\u000achoice is untrammelled and when nothing prevents our being able to do\u000awhat we like best, every pleasure is to be welcomed and every pain\u000aavoided. But in certain circumstances and owing to the claims of duty\u000aor the obligations of business is will frequently occur that pleasures\u000ahave to be repudiated and annoyances accepted. The wise man therefore\u000aalways holds in these matters to this principle of selection: he\u000arejects pleasures to secure other greater pleasures, or else he endures\u000apains to avoid worse pains.\u000a

V\u000aIn 1994 I saw Pulp Fiction in the theater 5 times. I was obsessed with\u000ait. Still am...it's my #2, and on occasion, #1. But there was another\u000afilm I saw multiple times in the theater in '94 - The Shawshank\u000aRedemption.And this one, hardly anyone saw in the theater. Nobody really knew\u000aabout it, until all of a sudden it was nominated for Best Picture and\u000alots more Oscars. But honestly no one in the world thought it would\u000awin, I'm sure the Vegas odds were laughable. And of course Forrest Gump\u000aovershadowed both Shawshank & Pulp Fiction. So Shawshank was my film for years, I found it - randomly at my local\u000atheater. I owned it on VHS, I watched it incessantly. It's been my\u000afavorite film for 20 years. It's well known it gained a cult following on VHS. But IMDb really put\u000ait on the map. And IMDb is to be thanked for the last 7 or 8 years, of\u000aidiots who've just come into the film recently claiming it's "a trendy\u000afilm to claim as your favorite." I want to get physically violent with\u000apeople who say that. Rather, it's trendy for idiots to say it's trendy\u000ato love Shawshank.It doesn't matter. Shawshank is timeless. It is so layered, so thick &\u000adense with ideas & emotions, subtleties & nuance & little moments that\u000aare gigantic. Watching Shawshank is a spiritual experience, a journey\u000athat never gets old. It's a drug.God, I just saw IMDb is getting close to racking up 1,200,000 votes on\u000aShawshank. And 9.3. You cannot argue with that. It cuts across\u000acultures, sexes, and races. Unbelievable miracle of a film, created by sunlight itself.\u000a

V\u000aOver all excellent movie, Truly keeps you captivated throughout the\u000awhole film and you become invested in the characters. The characters\u000ahave so much charisma, the impact they have on each other through out\u000ais amazing to see. There is a greater meaning behind the actions and\u000aending which gets engraved into your thoughts, even after finishing the\u000afilm one can only walk themselves through the film in memory and try to\u000amake sense of it but in reality you'd have to watch the film twice just\u000ato notice how much more brilliant it really is than you actually\u000athought! The actors were no doubt a great pick, the role really toned\u000ain on each actor's strengths and magnified it so the character was more\u000avisible than the mask. The story, with no doubt, plays out very\u000asmoothly and the consistent flow it has simply allows you to watch it\u000awithout getting bored or impatient even once.\u000a

V\u000aI have never heard about this movie in fact and it was very surprising\u000ato see such 'not known' movie at top of the list and that too above\u000aGODFATHERS. For me this was the only reason to watch Shawshank\u000aRedemption initially but now it is my favorite 'watch again and again'\u000amovie. Reasons ? Well . (1) Simple but outstanding Storyline with so\u000amany twists and turns. (2) All twists and turns are natural and\u000alogical. You find them somewhere near to you but fail to detect till\u000athey are revealed on the screen. This is one of the most interesting\u000afeature of this movie. (3) Direction is per excellence as may be\u000aexpected from any great movie. (4) Characters and Acting: Outstanding.\u000a(5) Narration by Morgan Freeman. (6) Music: suffice to mention the\u000aharmonica played when Red approaches the oak tree he was searching for.\u000a(7) One of the most loving ending that leaves you in a state of virtual\u000aecstasy. You leave the screen smiling from within. In fact all great\u000amovies contains the features I have mentioned above but what\u000adistinguishes Shawshank Redemption from other great movies, in my view,\u000aand what makes it most deserving for No. 1 spot, is, undoubtedly, the\u000alast 20 minutes of the movie that is pure ecstasy that leads to the\u000amost satisfying ending.\u000a

V\u000aI will get straight to the point. This movie was made with very careful\u000aattention to detail. According to the Formula of life (Time + Effort =\u000aValue) It fits perfectly. Unfortunately the fault I found with this\u000amovie was in the thought process behind the acting. I was never sure of\u000awhere any of the actors stood with themselves or each other meaning the\u000amovie's great twist at the end had no meaning. Acting only ever needs\u000ato be amazing but the story needs to be exceptional because in real\u000alife people don't act extraordinarily its the story of peoples lives\u000awhich touches us the most because everyone can relate or compare their\u000astory the acting is just according to the actor. But other then that it\u000awas interesting to watch not so much enjoyable which is always sad.\u000a

V\u000a(This comment contains a little summary of the film, I didn't mean to\u000aspoil the movie for you, but when you are afraid of me spoiling the\u000amovie don't read the review.)The Shawshank Redemption is one of the best movies ever made in my\u000aopinion. I've seen many films and this one really comes out. I think\u000athis movie is 'timeless'. It's an old movie, made in 1994 (I wasn't\u000aeven born) but it doesn't feel like that when you are watching it.\u000aAlright I have to admit that you can see it on the quality of the film\u000aand on other things too. It isn't HD or something like that but it\u000agives the film a special character that it needs to be so good. It also\u000adoesn't have all those special effects like in Life of Pi, with the\u000atiger Richard Parker who is fully made with the computer, or in the\u000aAvengers. So it isn't spectacular in that way. I think the movie is\u000aspectacular in the way it's built up and in its plot line.Andy Dufresne (Tim Robbins) is locked up in the Shawshank State\u000aPenitentiary because he is accused of murdering his wife and her lover.\u000aIn prison he gets to know smuggler Ellis "Red" Redding (Morgan Freeman)\u000aand soon they become friends. Red smuggles a rock hammer in prison for\u000aAndy to make 'chess pieces'. He also gets several posters and other\u000astuff. He makes his chess pieces, but that's not the only reason for\u000abuying his hammer. He also has some other plans. First Andy works in\u000athe washing room and sometimes he gets raped by Bogs. One day the\u000aprison needs some men to work on the roof and with a little skill Andy\u000acan arrange some beers for his fellows. They start to like him and they\u000aaccept him as a friend. Slightly Andy works himself up so he can do the\u000aaccountancy of the director of the prison. He decides to swindle the\u000adirector and he makes up an whole new person with every legit paper a\u000ahuman needs. After the release of Brooks Andy takes over the library\u000aand he gives it a new boost. He receives new money for books and he can\u000aexpand it. His life in prison goes well but he doesn't lose his hope\u000aand faith in a better future even though Red has warned him that hope\u000ais a dangerous thing. When you want to know the end and the rest of the\u000afilm you really need to buy and watch it because after the first time\u000athere is a big chance that you will love the film and that you are\u000agoing to watch it more than once. I think that every single bit of the film perfectly fits. The music,\u000athe photography, the story There is a reason why this film is standing\u000aon number 1 in the IMDb top 250 and why it has 7 Oscar nominations.\u000a

This\u000ais a film worth a watch with amazing story-line, drama and performance.\u000aMorgan Freeman made it up as a cast.But i can not say that this is a best or even a better movie at all. It\u000ais a usually movie with a catchy, just and simple plot. This film is\u000aequipped with nice and beautiful plus emotional and interesting plot\u000awith amazing direction. So this is a movie that appeals nearly everyone, and that is why it is\u000aso over-rated but that should not mean it is a all time best movie. It\u000ais a simple and honest movie which is great but yes over-rated.\u000a

V\u000aI'm not one to judge a book by it's cover, or in this case a film, but\u000aI had no interest in watching this film. This was mainly due to the\u000afact that my boyfriend loves it and we are usually on opposite ends of\u000athe spectrum when it comes to choosing films. But this is the one film\u000athat we can agree on. It has everything that he likes, (crime, violence\u000aand rebellion) whilst also having everything that I love in a film (a\u000awell thought out story, unexpected turns of events, great actors).\u000aFilms are like a passion to me, and The Shawshank Redemption is in a\u000aleague all of it's own. Tim Robbins created such a character that we\u000aall think we know but his deception and rebellion towards the end of\u000athe film intrigues me and makes me respect Andy so much more. "Fear can\u000ahold you prisoner, hope can set you free", the tag-line of the film\u000aholds a deep significance as nobody suspected a thing from Andy whilst\u000athe years passed by in prison, yet his ulterior motives fuelled by hope\u000ahelped him in his quests!\u000a

V\u000aHow do you define perfection in a movie? For me it's a combination of\u000adirection, script, performances and all the technical aspects of making\u000aa film, so that the viewer can be transported elsewhere. This is how I\u000adefine the Shawshank Redemption. If you haven't seen it, you can be\u000asurprised by the end. But even when you see it again and again, it\u000adoesn't matter if you already know the end, because the journey is as\u000amuch (if not more) enjoyable. It's an amazing movie, with great\u000aperformances from Tim Robbins, Morgan Freeman and all supporting cast.\u000aThey make you feel happy, and sad, and laugh, and cry. Movies like this\u000adon't come very often, and should be enjoyed by all. Very highly\u000arecommended!\u000a

V\u000aThis film is truly a work of art a master piece one of the greats. This\u000afilm is not just so amazing because of the amazing story (based of the\u000aStephen king book) but also because of the amazing acting and\u000adirecting. It's about Andy Dufresne (Tim Robbins) who is a banker that\u000agets convicted of double murder and is sentenced to life term at\u000ashaw-shank were he meats Ellis read redding ( Morgan freeman ) who\u000apicks him as the new recruit most likely to crack under the pressure\u000amanly to the fact that they have a corrupt warden (Bob Gunton),\u000asadistic guards led by Capt. Byron Hadley (Clancy Brown), and inmates\u000awho are little better than animals, willing to use rape or beatings to\u000ainsure their dominance. But Andy does not crack: he has the hope of the\u000atruly innocent, which (together with his smarts) allow him to prevail\u000abehind bars. He uses his banking skills to win favour with the wardens\u000aand guards.\u000a

V\u000aFor the first time watchers the story starts with a lame and feels like\u000aboring. But it gradually picks up the pace after 15-20 Min's and every\u000amoment will be best. Tim Robbins acting is the best. The moral of this\u000amovie is always "Hope for the Best" Best will always come. You need to\u000abe a patience for it.If you watch the movie carefully there is a very good twist at the end\u000awhich is not expected at all. Some of the famous TV series like prison\u000abreak are based on this movie itself.Direction by Frank Darabont was simply superb. I can say that morgan\u000afreeman has given his career best performance in this movie.I would rate this 10 out of 10. Fantastic and all time top 1 movie.\u000a

V\u000aI have never seen such an amazing film since I saw The Shawshank\u000aRedemption. Shawshank encompasses friendships, hardships, hopes, and\u000adreams. And what is so great about the movie is that it moves you, it\u000agives you hope. Even though the circumstances between the characters\u000aand the viewers are quite different, you don't feel that far removed\u000afrom what the characters are going through.It is a simple film, yet it has an everlasting message. Frank Darabont\u000adidn't need to put any kind of outlandish special effects to get us to\u000alove this film, the narration and the acting does that for him. Why\u000athis movie didn't win all seven Oscars is beyond me, but don't let that\u000asway you to not see this film, let its ranking on the IMDb's top 250\u000alist sway you, let your friends recommendation about the movie sway\u000ayou.Set aside a little over two hours tonight and rent this movie.

V\u000aMisery and Stand By Me were the best adaptations up until this one, now\u000ayou can add Shawshank to that list.This is simply one of the best films ever made and I know I am not the\u000afirst to say that and I certainly won't be the last. The standing on\u000athe IMDb is a true barometer of that. #3 as of this date and I'm sure\u000ait could be number 1. So I'll just skip all the normal praise of the\u000afilm because we all know how great it is. But let me perhaps add that\u000awhat I find so fascinating about Shawshank is that Stephen King wrote\u000ait.King is one of the best writers in the world. Books like IT and the\u000aCastle Rock series are some of the greatest stories ever told. But his\u000abest adaptations are always done by the best directors. The Shining was\u000abrilliantly interpreted by Kubrick and of course the aforementioned\u000aMisery and Stand By Me are both by Rob Reiner. Now Frank Darabont comes\u000aonto the scene and makes arguably the best King film ever. He seems to\u000aunderstand what King wants to say and he conveys that beautifully. What makes this film one of the best ever made is the message it\u000aconveys. It is one of eternal hope. Andy Dufresne, played by Tim\u000aRobbins, has been sent to prison for a crime he did not commit. But he\u000anever loses hope. He never gives up his quest to become a free man\u000aagain. His years of tenacity, patience and wits keep him not only sane,\u000abut it gives his mind and a spirit a will to live. This film has a\u000adifferent feel to it. There has never been anything like it before and\u000aI don't know if there will again.I'm not going to say any more about this film, it has already been\u000asaid, but just suffice to say that I am glad that Forrest Gump won best\u000apicture in 94. I would have been equally glad if Pulp Fiction or\u000aShawshank would have won. It is that good of a movie and one that will\u000abe appreciated for years to come.\u000a

V\u000aShawshank is unique in the genre and unlocked a new potential for movie\u000amakers to break the inherent confines of a prison picture. This was\u000ademonstrated later on with Darabont once again redefining the prison\u000apicture in The Green Mile - a classic in its own right. So why is\u000aShawshank so popular and tops many best movie lists? Not hard to figure\u000aout. The entertainment value is high and our empathy is heightened for\u000aAndy and Red. A lot of deserved attention over the years has gone to\u000aFreeman, but Robbins carries his part just as well. We have to remember\u000athe Andy character is somewhat that of a semi-tough geek, which is a\u000atough balancing act to portray - unless part of your own personality is\u000amuch like that. Robbins impresses me for this and meets the\u000aexpectation. But I think Freeman's character allows more scope for\u000aexceeding an expectation which is probably why Freeman is lauded a bit\u000amore. So Shawshank, after all these years, still awaits like a trap to\u000aensnare new devotees. Another sign of its worthiness - it pulls you in\u000aquickly.\u000a

V\u000aIt is a strange comment to make about a film set inside a prison, but\u000a"The Shawshank Redemption" creates a warm hold on our feelings because\u000ait makes us a member of a family. Many movies offer us vicarious\u000aexperiences and quick, superficial emotions. "Shawshank" slows down and\u000alooks. It uses the narrator's calm, observant voice to include us in\u000athe story of men who have formed a community behind bars. It is deeper\u000athan most films; about continuity in a lifetime, based on friendship\u000aand hope.Darabont constructs the film to observe the story, not to punch it up\u000aor upstage it. Upstaging, in fact, is unknown in this film; the actors\u000aare content to stay within their roles, the story moves in an orderly\u000away, and the film itself reflects the slow passage of the decades.\u000a"When they put you in that cell," Red says, "when those bars slam home,\u000athat's when you know it's for real. Old life blown away in the blink of\u000aan eye. Nothing left but all the time in the world to think about it."\u000aWatching the film again, I admired it even more than the first time I\u000asaw it. Affection for good films often grows with familiarity, as it\u000adoes with music. Some have said life is a prison, we are Red, Andy is\u000aour redeemer. All good art is about something deeper than it admits.\u000a

People got Excited\u000aabout it. No one seems to know Why or What Manifested said Excitement,\u000ait just Happened. A Resurrection to become one of the most Beloved\u000aMovies Ever. Managing to Steadily Climb to "God-Like" Status among Best\u000aof Lists and Fanatic Praise.It is a Fine Movie. A Throwback Movie. A more or less Standard\u000aStorytelling of Human Perseverance and Hope against Outrageous\u000aMisfortune. A Feel Good Film that has made a lot of People Feel Good.\u000aNothing Really Out of the Ordinary Happens as far as Prison Dramas go.\u000aBut what does Happen is done with such Subtlety and Pathos that the\u000aLong Sentence of the Running Time goes by Effortlessly. This is a Great Movie that Never tries to be Great. it's just a Smooth,\u000aEntertaining, and Effective Personal Prison Drama with some Social\u000aMessaging and Character Explorations. The Usual Prison Sledgehammer\u000aApproach gives way to a Rock Hammer. Small and Light, but it gets the\u000aJob Done.\u000a

V\u000aOne of my all time favorites. Shawshank Redemption is a very moving\u000astory about hope and the power of friendship. The cast is first rate\u000awith everyone giving a great performance. Tim Robbins and Morgan\u000aFreeman carry the movie, but Bob Gunton and Clancy Brown are perfect as\u000athe Warden Norton and prison guard captain Hadley respectively. And\u000aJames Whitmore's portrayal of an elderly inmate Brooks is moving. The\u000ascreenplay gives almost every actor at least one or more memorable\u000alines through out the film. As well as a very surprising "twist" near\u000athe end that almost knocked me out of my chair. If you have not seen\u000athis movie rent it or better yet buy it.

When "Warden Norton"(Bob\u000aGunton) tries to open Bible, Andy Dufresne handles the situation. This\u000ascene rolls again in all our mind, like mind blowing in the climax. Of\u000acourse it's disappointing that other master-pieces like pulp_fiction\u000aand forest gump released in same year which made "The Shawshank\u000aRedemption" ended up with no Oscar's.

It has since enjoyed a\u000aremarkable life on cable television, VHS, DVD, and Blu-ray. It was\u000aincluded in the American Film Institute's 100 Years...100 Movies 10th\u000aAnniversary\u000a

V\u000aIn 1946, a banker named Andy Dufresne (Tim Robbins) is convicted of a\u000adouble murder, even though he stubbornly proclaims his innocence. He's\u000asentenced to a life term at the Shawshank State Prison in Maine, where\u000aanother lifer, Ellis "Red" Redding (Morgan Freeman), picks him as the\u000anew recruit most likely to crack under the pressure. The ugly realities\u000aof prison life are quickly introduced to Andy: a corrupt warden (Bob\u000aGunton), sadistic guards led by Capt. Byron Hadley (Clancy Brown), and\u000ainmates who are little better than animals, willing to use rape or\u000abeatings to insure their dominance. But Andy does not crack: he has the\u000ahope of the truly innocent, which (together with his smarts) allow him\u000ato prevail behind bars. He uses his banking skills to win favor with\u000athe warden and the guards, doing the books for Norton's illegal\u000abusiness schemes and keeping an eye on the investments of most of the\u000aprison staff. In exchange, he is able to improve the prison library and\u000abring some dignity and respect back to many of the inmates, including\u000aRed. Based on a story by Stephen King, The Shawshank Redemption was the\u000adirectorial debut of screenwriter Frank Darabont.\u000a

V\u000aIt's been 15 years since I watched this movie for the first time. Back\u000athen, in my youth, several aspects of this movie made me think a lot:\u000athe value of true friendship, the injustices in life, the importance of\u000anot giving up on your dreams and, the most powerful of all, always have\u000ahope and make your thoughts and actions rely on that hope. I also\u000aremember thinking that, while some characters got what they deserved,\u000aothers were wronged in a way that annoyed me too much. That was the\u000areason that I liked but not loved this movie in the first time.After that first time, I watched this movie at least another five\u000atimes. Today, 15 years later, I can say that the injustices in the\u000amovie are not only bearable but also completely necessary. This is the\u000areal magic about this movie: you can find good in murderers, evil in\u000awardens, friendship in a deceitful place, justice in injustices and\u000ahope in despair. Those ingredients are responsible for making this\u000astory so believable. This movie is capable of captivating the viewer\u000athrough the natural bond created with the protagonist, in such way\u000athat, in the end, when everything went to despair, the viewer learns\u000athat hope is the only thing that anyone should not abandon. Yes, this\u000amovie is a true masterpiece.\u000a

V\u000aIt is a film that can be watched over and over again, however, it is\u000avery predictable and slightly dated...I would recommend ordering in, kicking back and enjoying the movie on a\u000abig screen TV with surround sound audio. The mood can get to be a\u000alittle deep, so if you have any un-mended wounds deep within your soul,\u000amake sure to have an endless supply of tissues at hand. It is a film\u000aabout beating the odds, about injustice and retribution. It isn't\u000areally a movie about payback as much as it is about looking inside\u000aoneself, seeing the good in life and the digging in of their heels when\u000acircumstances become seemingly overwhelming and impossible. The story almost follows the classic structure of the hero's journey\u000aand manages to hit every emotional nerve on the way. There is one other\u000amovie that I can think of in all of cinema history that has managed to\u000apull that off and it is the princess bride. The princess bride is very\u000alight hearted and is nothing like The Shawshank Redemption except for\u000athe fact that it is multi faceted and emotional.\u000a

He was very intelligent\u000aman as he made his friendship with corrupted Warden of the Prison yet\u000ait was only one sided. In the end, when he escapes from the prison, he\u000atakes down the whole life of Warden and his colleagues. After few days,\u000ahis friend Red also gets out of jail and travels to Texas and meet his\u000afriend Andy.As a whole this movie was good and even it is the best. It deserves to\u000abe number 1.

V\u000aThe story, has 3 power points that make it the best movie ever made.\u000aOne is when the young prisoner, Tommy, tells them that he knows the\u000akiller of Dufrense's wife. One when we discover that the whole time\u000aDufrence was digging the wall; and one when Norton sees the big hole in\u000athe wall. This three points makes it easier for the director to say the\u000amovie's result: hope. The other movies such as The Gosfather don't have\u000asuch points; that makes them always "the second movie". Tim Robbins'\u000aplaying as Andy Dufrence, is surly one of the most important points\u000athat makes the film like this. I never would understand why they didn't\u000agive any Oscar Awards to him. But also, Morgan Freeman wasn't as good\u000aas should be. his smiles, looked really fake, but there is surly no\u000aproblem with the narrating.Freeman's soft deep voice was the best\u000aoption for this movie; but in acting, he was just "Normal"; that isn't\u000aenough for a movie like The Shawshank Redemption. In the year 1994,\u000aShawshank redemption and pulp fiction were both good, but the thing\u000athat makes Shawshank redemption better, are the little strong points,\u000aall over the movie, I insinuated.\u000a

V\u000athe movie was good but not as expected... movie was slow before\u000ahalftime and also later after halftime. characters portrait was\u000aappreciable,life of jail shown was real and cruelty within jail too.I\u000adidn't intend to see this movie at all: I do not like prison movies and\u000aI don't normally watch them. I work at a branch library and one day as\u000aI was checking The Shawshank Redemption out to one of our older\u000apatrons, she said to me, "Whenever I feel down or depressed, I check\u000aout this movie and watch it and it always makes me feel better." At the\u000atime, I thought that was very strange. One day there was nothing on TV\u000aexcept things I absolutely would not watch under any circumstance or\u000athings that I had seen too many times already. I remembered what she\u000asaid, so I watched it. I have watched it many many times since then and\u000ait gets better with every showing.

V\u000aThe Shawshank Redemption has certainly earned its reputation as one of\u000athe most effective prison movies in cinematic history - as the film,\u000awritten and directed by Frank Darabont, contains virtually all of the\u000atropes and devices that the genre has come to be associated with. The\u000aensuing inclusion of such familiar elements as the Evil Warden and the\u000aSadistic Guard are undeniably put to brilliant use by Darabont, with\u000athe end result a piece of work that - aside from a midsection that's\u000aalmost egregiously episodic - manages to hold the viewer transfixed\u000avirtually from start to finish. The Shawshank Redemption works not only\u000aas an excellent prison drama,but as a metaphor for overcoming our own\u000aprivate prisons.\u000a

V\u000aA friend of mine told me 2 years ago about this film, A said maybe it's\u000aboring but after I seen it I was speechlessThe greatest movie set in a prison I've ever seen! Its full of courage\u000afrom Tim Robbins to survive prison and no matter what the differences\u000abetween him and Morgan Freeman and all the other prisoners, no matter\u000awhat violence comes up, no matter their crimes, no matter what crazy or\u000aillegal things they have to do to survive prison, no matter what the\u000awarden does to Tim Robbins, together prison is awesome and they can\u000aredeem themselves. Movies like this show what would happen if prisoners\u000aaccept people's differences and redeem themselves from their crimes and\u000athat's good thing because people don't need to act like idiots in\u000aprison. Despite the graphic violence in this movie in the beginning,\u000aTim Robbins and Morgan Freeman used friendship to forget prison and\u000amade each other good people and they were great people! Whoever does\u000aNOT like this movie is a bully and needs lighten up because this is a\u000alight-heart movie of teaching you the lessons of prison.\u000a

Shawshank Redemption is a very moving story about hope and the\u000apower of friendship and how far those to things can get you. What makes\u000athis film one of the best ever made is the message it conveys. It is\u000aone of eternal hope. Andy Dufresne, played by Tim Robbins, has been\u000asent to prison for a crime he did not commit. But he never loses hope.\u000aHe never gives up his quest to become a free man again. His years of\u000atenacity, patience and wits keep him not only sane, but it gives his\u000amind and a spirit a will to live.

V\u000a"The Shawshank Redemption" is a movie about time, patience and loyalty\u000a- - not sexy qualities, perhaps, but they grow on you during the\u000asubterranean progress of this story, which is about how two men serving\u000alife sentences in prison become friends and find a way to fight off\u000adespair.The story is narrated by "Red" Redding (Morgan Freeman), who has been\u000ainside the walls of Shawshank Prison for a very long time and is its\u000aleading entrepreneur. He can get you whatever you need: cigarettes,\u000acandy, even a little rock pick like an amateur geologist might use. One\u000aday he and his fellow inmates watch the latest bus load of prisoners\u000aunload, and they make bets on who will cry during their first night in\u000aprison, and who will not. Red bets on a tall, lanky guy named Andy\u000aDufresne (Tim Robbins), who looks like a babe in the woods.But Andy does not cry, and Red loses the cigarettes he wagered. Andy\u000aturns out to be a surprise to everyone in Shawshank, because within him\u000ais such a powerful reservoir of determination and strength that nothing\u000aseems to break him. Andy was a banker on the outside, and he's in for\u000amurder. He's apparently innocent, and there are all sorts of details\u000ainvolving his case, but after a while they take on a kind of unreality;\u000aall that counts inside prison is its own society -- who is strong, who\u000ais not -- and the measured passage of time.Red is also a lifer. From time to time, measuring the decades, he goes\u000aup in front of the parole board, and they measure the length of his\u000aterm (20 years, 30 years) and ask him if he thinks he has been\u000arehabilitated. Oh, most surely, yes, he replies; but the fire goes out\u000aof his assurances as the years march past, and there is the sense that\u000ahe has been institutionalized -- that, like another old lifer who kills\u000ahimself after being paroled, he can no longer really envision life on\u000athe outside.Red's narration of the story allows him to speak for all of the\u000aprisoners, who sense a fortitude and integrity in Andy that survives\u000athe years. Andy will not kiss butt. He will not back down. But he is\u000anot violent, just formidably sure of himself. For the warden (Bob\u000aGunton), he is both a challenge and a resource; Andy knows all about\u000abookkeeping and tax preparation, and before long he's been moved out of\u000ahis prison job in the library and assigned to the warden's office,\u000awhere he sits behind an adding machine and keeps tabs on the warden's\u000aill-gotten gains. His fame spreads, and eventually he's doing the taxes\u000aand pension plans for most of the officials of the local prison system.There are key moments in the film, as when Andy uses his clout to get\u000asome cold beers for his friends who are working on a roofing job. Or\u000awhen he befriends the old prison librarian (James Whitmore). Or when he\u000aoversteps his boundaries and is thrown into solitary confinement. What\u000aquietly amazes everyone in the prison -- and us, too -- is the way he\u000aaccepts the good and the bad as all part of some larger pattern than\u000aonly he can fully see.The partnership between the characters played by Tim Robbins and Morgan\u000aFreeman is crucial to the way the story unfolds. This is not a "prison\u000adrama" in any conventional sense of the word. It is not about violence,\u000ariots or melodrama. The word "redemption" is in the title for a reason.\u000aThe movie is based on a story, Rita Hayworth and the Shawshank\u000aRedemption, by Stephen King, which is quite unlike most of King's work.\u000aThe horror here is not of the supernatural kind, but of the sort that\u000aflows from the realization than 10, 20, 30 years of a man's life have\u000aunreeled in the same unchanging daily prison routine.The director, Frank Darabont, paints the prison in drab grays and\u000ashadows, so that when key events do occur, they seem to have a life of\u000atheir own.Andy, as played by Robbins, keeps his thoughts to himself. Red, as\u000aFreeman plays him, is therefore a crucial element in the story: His\u000aclose observation of this man, down through the years, provides the way\u000awe monitor changes and track the measure of his influence on those\u000aaround him. And all the time there is something else happening, hidden\u000aand secret, which is revealed only at the end."The Shawshank Redemption" is not a depressing story, although I may\u000ahave made it sound that way. There is a lot of life and humor in it,\u000aand warmth in the friendship that builds up between Andy and Red. There\u000ais even excitement and suspense, although not when we expect it. But\u000amostly the film is an allegory about holding onto a sense of personal\u000aworth, despite everything. If the film is perhaps a little slow in its\u000amiddle passages, maybe that is part of the idea, too, to give us a\u000asense of the leaden passage of time, before the glory of the final\u000aredemption.\u000a

V\u000aWhenever i see Shawshank Redemption at the top of the IMDb top 250, it\u000agives such a beautiful experience. When i just started following good\u000amovies, and seeing this movie at the top, i watched it. well i liked\u000athis one in the first. but a whole world has turned around. I have\u000awatched whole lot of movies, that varies from that of Hollywood to\u000aother world movies which are just great. But still till present,\u000aShawshank has not lost any of its aura. it is a beautiful experience\u000awatching this movie. many would review this movie as over-hyped,\u000aoverrated and all. i think they are just trying to describe cinematic\u000aexperience, but this movie is a Life experience. So that is a point\u000awhere they differ. The one who says Shawshank is overrated, might not\u000asay the same about The Green Mile(same director and author). I have\u000aalways admired the works of Stephen king, but his works just seemed too\u000amuch for movies. Even Stanley Kubrick couldn't quite actually cover The\u000aShining. We had to wait until Frank Darabont to get a good portrayal of\u000aking's work. and the wait was finally worth it. The green mile is the\u000anext, though it isn't as much high on the rating as this one. Just i\u000athink this movie was one of many which increased my interest in\u000awatching movies. And about the Top position in IMDb, it is absolutely\u000aworth it.\u000a

V\u000aan awesome movie i have ever seen... Rita Hayworth and Shawshank\u000aRedemption is a novella by Stephen King, from his collection Different\u000aSeasons (1982), subtitled Hope Springs Eternal. It was adapted for the\u000ascreen in 1994 as The Shawshank Redemption, which was nominated for\u000aseven Academy Awards in 1994, including Best Picture.[1] In 2009, it\u000awas adapted for the stage as the play The Shawshank Redemption.[2]The novella's plot line is heavily based on God Sees the Truth, But\u000aWaits by Leo Tolstoy. This movie is not your ordinary Hollywood flick.\u000aIt has a great and deep message. This movie has a foundation and just\u000akept on being built on from their and that foundation is hope.\u000a

V\u000aI am just going to keep my review short and won't get into fine\u000adetails..With that said.. This movie is probably the most incredible adaptation\u000afilm of all time. Everything is just right, the actors, the production,\u000aeverything falls in line with the makings of a great movie. If you've never seen this before, I highly recommend you check out this\u000awonderful film. Even if you aren't a huge fan of the plot, any movie\u000alover can credit this film with being perfectly well done.As I've said, the chosen actors fit their roles perfectly, they make\u000athe characters come alive to the viewer, which is one criterion for an\u000aexcellent movie. The score is great, it is subtle yet draws so much\u000afocus and emotion to the scene, another criterion. The venue filming\u000alocation is a personal treasure to me, as I live close-by. Pretty much\u000aevery angle of this film can be looked at with pride and example of how\u000aa movie could, and should be produced and directed.\u000a

V\u000aI saw The Shawshank Redemption only a few weeks ago, while I knew it\u000awas number 1 on IMDb Top 250. Knowing the main idea of the movie, I\u000acouldn't imagine how this movie can be at the top. I watched it on TV\u000aand this was one of those rare films which excited me so much in front\u000aof my TV. I will not talk about the acting or the directing because so\u000amany reviewers did a better review about that before me but I will just\u000aadd that what I find so unique to this movie is that he is RIGHT from\u000athe beginning to the end. You feel so moved all along the movie and\u000awhen the movie is over I have this impression that it was a movie quiet\u000a"simple" shared with a feeling of having saw something that is a way\u000ahigher others movies. And that is what make this movie extraordinary.\u000a

V\u000aThis movie is based on a novella by Stephen King, but don't let that\u000aput you off. It's not a horror film, rather a thumpingly good ode to\u000afriendship, hope, wit, wiles and wisdom, brimming with crackling\u000acharacters and topped with the most twisteroo of twists since The\u000aCrying Game. Found guilty of killing his unfaithful wife and her lover\u000ain a fit of passion, sullen accountant Andy Dufresne (Robbins, casting\u000aoff his goofball image to display more layers than the proverbial\u000aonion) is shipped to the Gothic wind-swept corridors of the Shawshank\u000aState Prison for life. It is here the movie gracefully unfolds. With a\u000abeautifully rounded script, writer/director Darabont conjures up a\u000aspellbinding personal odyssey stretching through the years from 1946 to\u000a1967.Dufresne, all the while protesting his innocence, slowly overcomes the\u000ahellfire tortures of the prison system - an unblinking range of\u000abeatings, rapings and abject humiliations - while managing to inspire\u000ahis fellow inmates to lift their degraded horizons. Among them is Red\u000a(Freeman, in a matchless supporting role), the lifer who can, given\u000atime, provide virtually anything. And for reasons best known to\u000ahimself, Dufresne requires 40s starlet Rita Hayworth, provisioned in\u000aposter form.The mood swings rigorously through every emotion as the cranky, wiseguy\u000aand downright crazed array of criminals bare the brunt of the turbulent\u000alife within the doomy Shawshank catacomb. Then it gets really mean,\u000agearing up for its injury-time shockers. Dufresne, a whiz with figures,\u000ais bullied into running the warden's (Gunton) petty accounting scams,\u000agiving him the chance to execute his and the film's final, greatest\u000amiracle.If you're miserable enough to look for gripes then, yes, it does drift\u000aon too long and who needs prison buggery again? Yet the ending has such\u000apoetic completeness you're too busy contentedly chuckling to worry\u000aabout sore behinds. This may have confounded American audiences - it\u000aflopped big-time on planet Yank - but a more divine movie experience\u000ayou will not find this side of Oscardom. Spread the word.\u000a

V\u000aOne of the best movies ever. This one never gets old. Tim Robbins is my\u000afavorite actor and was before this movie. This movie is one of his\u000abest. His other classic favorite of mine is Jacobs Ladder. Love the\u000adevelopment of the characters in the movie. Each one is his on and adds\u000ato the movie. Very good script, very original, clever. I wish he would\u000ahave won the Oscar for this movie. I also wish Morgan Freeman would\u000ahave won as well. Another point that was made in this movie that\u000asticks, is how when you have done the same thing for so long, you don't\u000aknow how to not do it. Point was made and shown several times by\u000adifferent actors. Love this quote: She was beautiful. God I loved her.\u000aI just didn't know how to show it.\u000a

After watching this film four times in one week I noticed\u000acertain themes in scenes that after the first time watching it I did\u000anot catch. Each scene has so much background that it fascinating to\u000awatch from beginning to end. We have to give credit to Stephen King,\u000ahis short story is the main reason why this movie exist.

V\u000aThe Shawshank Redemption(1994) is an American drama movie set in 1947\u000aand spanning 20 years of two prisoners at Shawshank who survive the\u000aplace with no hope of ever coming out, but one still thrives on the\u000a'dangerous' but 'good thing'. Based on a novella Rita Hayworth and\u000aShawshank Redemption by Stephen King, the movie hooks you from its very\u000afirst scene. An innocent person, Andy Dufresne is convicted for two\u000alife sentences, and in the prison, he meets Red, a man who have spent\u000aalmost twenty years there, and one, who has been here as long as he can\u000aremember (50 years). With a life different from anything in the outside\u000aworld, the movie takes you on a tour of life of these people where\u000acorruption, hypocrisy of religion and authority, friendship and enmity\u000aare hard to miss.Morgan Freeman as Red with a very natural acting, and Tim Robins as\u000aAndy Dufresne playing a young, bright and observant banker, the movie,\u000awritten and directed by Frank Darabont has soothing background music\u000aand great cinematography.A must, must watch.\u000a

There he\u000afinds many prison mates that become friends and value him as a person.\u000aThe main character goes through many unfortunate events and trials but\u000awhat eventually happens in the end is quite a good surprise.

I like how he he made the whole on the wall to escape that was\u000agood I also like when the two friends are reunited at the end of the\u000amovie. This movie was really good.i don't like writing much but I will\u000awrite the ten lines I need for this review cause this movie was really\u000agood. I don't agree with some these movies that are in the IMDb top 250\u000abut with this I do. I don't know if it should be number 1 but it was\u000areally good. If you want to watch a good prison movie then watch this\u000aone cause this is the best prison movie I have ever seen. I recommend\u000athis movie to everybody to see it. So if you haven't seen this movie go\u000aand watch it you will probably like more or as much as i did. You have\u000ato see this movie at least once in your whole entire life time.\u000a

V\u000aIn 1946, a banker named Andy Dufresne (Tim Robbins) is convicted of a\u000adouble murder, even though he stubbornly proclaims his innocence. He's\u000asentenced to a life term at the Shawshank State Prison in Maine, where\u000aanother lifer, Ellis Red Redding (Morgan Freeman), picks him as the new\u000arecruit most likely to crack under the pressure. The ugly realities of\u000aprison life are quickly introduced to Andy: a corrupt warden (Bob\u000aGunton), sadistic guards led by Capt. Byron Hadley (Clancy Brown), and\u000ainmates who are little better than animals, willing to use rape or\u000abeatings to insure their dominance. But Andy does not crack: he has the\u000ahope of the truly innocent, which (together with his smarts) allow him\u000ato prevail behind bars. He uses his banking skills to win favor with\u000athe warden and the guards, doing the books for Norton's illegal\u000abusiness schemes and keeping an eye on the investments of most of the\u000aprison staff. In exchange, he is able to improve the prison library and\u000abring some dignity and respect back to many of the inmates, including\u000aRed. Based on a story by Stephen King, The Shawshank Redemption was the\u000adirectorial debut of screenwriter Frank Darabont.~ Mark Deming,\u000a

V\u000a"The Shawshank Redemption" is a movie about time, patience and loyalty\u000a-- not sexy qualities, perhaps, but they grow on you during the\u000asubterranean progress of this story, which is about how two men serving\u000alife sentences in prison become friends and find a way to fight off\u000adespair.The story is narrated by "Red" Redding (Morgan Freeman), who has been\u000ainside the walls of Shawshank Prison for a very long time and is its\u000aleading entrepreneur. He can get you whatever you need: cigarettes,\u000acandy, even a little rock pick like an amateur geologist might use. One\u000aday he and his fellow inmates watch the latest bus load of prisoners\u000aunload, and they make bets on who will cry during their first night in\u000aprison, and who will not. Red bets on a tall, lanky guy named Andy\u000aDufresne (Tim Robbins), who looks like a babe in the woods.But Andy does not cry, and Red loses the cigarettes he wagered. Andy\u000aturns out to be a surprise to everyone in Shawshank, because within him\u000ais such a powerful reservoir of determination and strength that nothing\u000aseems to break him. Andy was a banker on the outside, and he's in for\u000amurder. He's apparently innocent, and there are all sorts of details\u000ainvolving his case, but after a while they take on a kind of unreality;\u000aall that counts inside prison is its own society -- who is strong, who\u000ais not -- and the measured passage of time.Red is also a lifer. From time to time, measuring the decades, he goes\u000aup in front of the parole board, and they measure the length of his\u000aterm (20 years, 30 years) and ask him if he thinks he has been\u000arehabilitated. Oh, most surely, yes, he replies; but the fire goes out\u000aof his assurances as the years march past, and there is the sense that\u000ahe has been institutionalized -- that, like another old lifer who kills\u000ahimself after being paroled, he can no longer really envision life on\u000athe outside.\u000a

V\u000aLike some other reviewers, I had avoided watching this: jail movies,\u000aStephen King ( and don't get me wrong - I really like his novels and\u000athe films esp The Shining - even though he hated Kubrick's version -\u000abut I had an expectation of his work which was counter to what makes a\u000a'universal' movie).Eventually, by accident, I had it on in the background on a UK digital\u000achannel, but in about 10 minutes in I stopped doing what I was doing\u000aand watched it. There's no point in my trying to add much to the thousands of words\u000athat have been written about this - all I know is that it touched me\u000adeeply - and in a way that I thought an all male cast and plot setting\u000acouldn't do. A truly beautiful, thought provoking and 'moral tale'.If there is anyone one out there who still haven't seen this - I really\u000asuggest that you do so. I simply can't believe that it barely recovered\u000abudget in the 90's when it was first released.I think it is one of the most exceptionally brilliant movies Hollywood\u000ahas ever produced.Morgan Freeman was brilliant, of course, but it is an ensemble piece:\u000athe whole is much much greater than its parts.\u000a

Stunningly written and amazing\u000aperformances, Morgan Freeman is especially brilliant, even more so than\u000ausual. The clever nature of the script coupled with the uplifting\u000anature of the story make it comfortably the best film I have ever had\u000athe pleasure of watching. When in response to the question 'what is the\u000agreatest film of all time?' I answer 'The Shawshank Redemption,' my\u000afriends tend to groan. They say that as it is such a common answer to\u000athe question I am copping out, I say there is a reason it is such a\u000acommon answer. Truly life affirming.\u000a

V\u000aThe film kept me going throughout the whole movie! I couldn't believe\u000ahow the production was able to pull such a great film off. I even talk\u000ato a few of my colleagues about this film and every single one gave\u000anothing but the up most respect and feedback that this film should have\u000abeen nominated more then the few awards it received. Morgan Freeman is\u000aone of the best actors and mentors of this age and time. I really look\u000aup to him for inspirational feedback and knowledge to help me as an\u000ayoung artist to better develop my craft and skills. I have grown to\u000alove this film over and over with time, this have became one of my\u000afavorite and best movie of all time. Morgan Freeman this is one of your\u000abest performance and I am truly happy to know that your work is still\u000agoing.\u000a

V\u000aWhen I read the book, actually novella, I had no idea it was being made\u000ainto a movie. I was delighted that I was actually seeing a film after I\u000ahad read the book - this never happens. My first surprise was how they pronounced Andy Dufresne's last name -\u000ain the book I did not pronounce it do-Frayne. I also wasn't expecting\u000aRed to be a black man but a white Irish guy.This is a superb film that takes the "prison film" genre on and wins.\u000aTim Robbins is perfectly cast and Morgan Freeman is highly watchable.\u000aHis voice-over really adds gravitas and a link to the audience\u000awondering how Andy will ever survive the awful existence of prison\u000alife.The prison itself is so imposing and the prisoners, for the most part,\u000ascary. Although not too many people were in the cinema when I saw it, I\u000aknew it would be a film that people would come to love. A small film\u000afrom a small novella about big things.The Brooks storyline was so beautiful and sad, that could have been a\u000amovie all by itself.\u000a

V\u000aIn its Oscar year, Shawshank Redemption (written and directed by Frank\u000aDarabont, after the novella Rita Hayworth and the Shawshank Redemption,\u000aby Stephen King) was nominated for seven Academy Awards, and walked\u000aaway with zero. Best Picture went to Forrest Gump, while Shawshank and\u000aPulp Fiction were "just happy to be nominated." Of course hindsight is\u000a20/20, but while history looks back on Gump as a good film, Pulp and\u000aRedemption are remembered as some of the all-time best. Pulp, however,\u000awas a success from the word "go," making a huge splash at Cannes and\u000amaking its writer-director an American master after only two films. For\u000aAndy Dufresne and Co., success didn't come easy. Fortunately, failure\u000awasn't a life sentence.After opening on 33 screens with take of $727,327, the $25M film fell\u000afast from theatres and finished with a mere $28.3M. The reasons for\u000afailure are many. Firstly, the title is a clunker. While iconic to fans\u000atoday, in 1994, people knew not and cared not what a 'Shawshank' was.\u000aOn the DVD, Tim Robbins laughs recounting fans congratulating him on\u000a"that 'Rickshaw' movie." Marketing-wise, the film's a nightmare, as\u000a'prison drama' is a tough sell to women, and the story of love between\u000atwo best friends doesn't spell winner to men. Worst of all, the movie\u000ais slow as molasses. As Desson Thomson writes for the Washington Post,\u000a"it wanders down subplots at every opportunity and ignores an abundance\u000aof narrative exit points before settling on its finale." But it is\u000athese same weaknesses that make the film so strong.Firstly, its setting. The opening aerial shots of the prison are a\u000atotal eye-opener. This is an amazing piece of architecture, strong and\u000aGothic in design. Immediately, the prison becomes a character. It casts\u000aits shadow over most of the film, its tall stone walls stretching above\u000aevery shot. It towers over the men it contains, blotting out all\u000amemories of the outside world. Only Andy (Robbins) holds onto hope.\u000aIt's in music, it's in the sandy beaches of Zihuatanejo; "In here's\u000awhere you need it most," he says. "You need it so you don't forget.\u000aForget that there are places in the world that aren't made out of\u000astone. That there's a - there's a - there's something inside that's\u000ayours, that they can't touch." Red (Morgan Freeman) doesn't think much\u000aof Andy at first, picking "that tall glass o' milk with the silver\u000aspoon up his ass" as the first new fish to crack. Andy says not a word,\u000aand losing his bet, Red resents him for it. But over time, as the two\u000aget to know each other, they quickly become the best of friends. This\u000aagain, is one of the film's major strengths. Many movies are about\u000alove, many flicks have a side-kick to the hero, but Shawshank is the\u000aonly one I can think of that looks honestly at the love between two\u000abest friends. It seems odd that Hollywood would skip this relationship\u000atime and again, when it's a feeling that weighs so much into everyone's\u000aday to day lives. Perhaps it's too sentimental to seem conventional,\u000abut Shawshank's core friendship hits all the right notes, and the film\u000ais much better for it.It's pacing is deliberate as well. As we spend the film watching the\u000asame actors, it is easy to forget that the movie's timeline spans well\u000aover 20 years. Such a huge measure of time would pass slowly in\u000areality, and would only be amplified in prison. And it's not as if the\u000afilm lacks interest in these moments. It still knows where it's going,\u000ait merely intends on taking its sweet time getting there. It pays off\u000aas well, as the tedium of prison life makes the climax that much more\u000aexhilarating. For anyone who sees it, it is a moment never to be\u000aforgotten.With themes of faith and hope, there is a definite religious subtext to\u000abe found here. Quiet, selfless and carefree, Andy is an obvious Christ\u000afigure. Warden Norton (Bob Gunton) is obviously modeled on Richard\u000aNixon, who, in his day, was as close to a personified Satan as they\u000acome. But if you aren't looking for subtexts, the movie speaks to\u000aanyone in search of hope. It is a compelling drama, and a very moving\u000afilm, perfectly written, acted and shot. They just don't come much\u000abetter than this.OVERALL SCORE: 9.8/10 = A+ The Shawshank Redemption served as a message\u000aof hope to Hollywood as well. More than any film in memory, it proved\u000athere is life after box office. Besting Forrest and Fiction, it ran\u000asolely on strong word of mouth and became the hottest rented film of\u000a1995. It currently sits at #2 in the IMDb's Top 250 Films, occasionally\u000aswapping spots with The Godfather as the top ranked film of all time --\u000aredemption indeed. If you haven't seen it yet, what the hell are you\u000awaiting for? As Andy says, "It comes down a simple choice, really.\u000aEither get busy living, or get busy dying."\u000a

The atmosphere in the scene\u000ais just impeccable, and it shows a great narrative with all the quirks\u000aand features we want to see and not something that is just made for the\u000afun of it for cash, this movie is truly captivating, i feel so\u000aconnected to the character more that anything. I watched this film so\u000amany times and it still steals me away with the amazing acting from the\u000abest. The atmosphere makes the film even more amazing, i just wish that\u000athere was much more so that i could keep watching and never stop\u000abecause that is the effect Shawshank Redemption has left on me and i\u000acan talk forever but i think that just watching the movie is better,\u000athere are many ways you still can watch this on a lot of things, and i\u000aknow it is still on NETFLIX it is a great watch 10/10 please go see it\u000anow i highly recommend it.\u000a

V\u000aAbsolutely the perfect movie, taking you through all your emotions,\u000ainsisting on making you feel your hope, anger, disgust, compassion,\u000alove, hate and pride. Genuinely moving with a voice-over to die for.\u000aThe narration takes you on a journey of epic storytelling, whilst still\u000amoving you to tears. Morgan Freeman delivers the most powerful\u000aperformance, I think, of his career as the very likable Red, while the\u000athen unknown to me, Tim Robbins delivers a poignant performance of an\u000aill justified innocent who gets caught up in a web of in-prison\u000apolitics and corruption. The schemes of Tim's character, Andy Dufresne\u000awith his wizardry with the abacus and knowledge of the tax system\u000abefriends the prisoners and the officers and the smug look on his face\u000ais to die for when he get his inmates a bottle of beer each to drink in\u000athe sunshine. How this didn't win an Oscar, I do not understand.\u000a

V\u000aIt is a strange comment to make about a film set inside a prison, but\u000a"The Shawshank Redemption" creates a warm hold on our feelings because\u000ait makes us a member of a family. Many movies offer us vicarious\u000aexperiences and quick, superficial emotions. "Shawshank" slows down and\u000alooks. It uses the narrator's calm, observant voice to include us in\u000athe story of men who have formed a community behind bars. It is deeper\u000athan most films; about continuity in a lifetime, based on friendship\u000aand hope. Interesting that although the hero of the film is the\u000aconvicted former banker Andy Dufresne (Tim Robbins), the action is\u000anever seen from his point of view. The film's opening scene shows him\u000abeing given two life sentences for the murder of his wife and her\u000alover, and then we move, permanently, to a point of view representing\u000athe prison population and particularly the lifer Ellis 'Red' Redding\u000a(Morgan Freeman). It is his voice remembering the first time he saw\u000aAndy ("looked like a stiff breeze would blow him over"), and\u000apredicting, wrongly, that he wouldn't make it in prison.\u000a

V\u000aIs film is a timeless classic, there are no two ways of saying it. It\u000adoesn't have explosions, mass deaths or laugh out loud comedy. Yet it\u000astill appeals to everyone. It has a simple and well thought out story line with a very simplistic\u000anarrative voice over, but with it being so simple - it makes it so\u000abrilliant. This film is the best example to everyone, that you don't\u000aneed explosions to create a masterpiece. Just Morgan Freeman and some\u000acasual swearing.Many would say that because it isn't exiting all the time it isn't a\u000agood film.

V\u000aA must watch this movie is with the movie nicely setup by its front\u000aline cast thus compelling with the excellent script of the movie. Loses\u000aa bit of essence in the middle but still keep u in grasp with the hope\u000aof the felony.This movie has all factors that a movie can have apart\u000afrom romance only and thus add versatility to this movie.Morgan Freeman\u000ahas done a excellent job in the complimenting the rhythm set up by Tim\u000aRobbins. It also gives us an idea that corruption is everywhere even in\u000aclosed bars of a jail it is practiced rather casually. And how many\u000aflaws are there in our decision making bodies. But in the end the hope\u000aof one man stand above all this things and inspire others in the same\u000aenvironment thus showing one of the brightest qualities of a human that\u000ais belief and inspiration. That's all I can say about this movie. Thank\u000ayou\u000a

V\u000aThe Shawshank Redemption was a film that I have heard so much about.\u000aMany of my friends have hailed it as their favorite film and one of the\u000agreatest films ever made. Now, being someone who isn't easily pleased;\u000aI went into The Shawshank Redemption with reservations. Coming out of the film, I realized that it made me feel warm. I know\u000athat's a weird saying but it's a comfort film. A lot of people love it\u000abecause it leaves you feeling happy and hopeful; not disturbed like\u000aChinatown or frightened like Halloween (1978). Shawshank is sentimental, joyful and has one great ending. Yet, the\u000afilm feels so "safe"; leading the audience to a bittersweet and\u000asomewhat forced conclusion. Overall, The Shawshank Redemption is a good film; it just doesn't take\u000arisks. Shawshank feels just fine in its little comfortable cinematic\u000aworld. If people enjoy that type of film, that's fine; I just think a film\u000athat takes more risks (2001: A Space Odyssey or The Tree Of Life)\u000ashould be deserving of the top spot of the IMDb Top 250.\u000a

V\u000aCan never imagine Shawshank could keep this secret for such a long\u000atime. When his friend subsided when leaving the poison, he never quit\u000ahis dream. When the poison leader forced him to do illegal things, he\u000acompromised to survive, because there is a dream deeply rooted in his\u000amind. A man is never broken down if only his mind is strong. Sometimes\u000awe consider desire as a kind of forbidden thing where wicked things\u000ahappened, however in other point, desire is a kind of driving force. I\u000athink the director is trying to convey to the audience that there is a\u000akind of force that can drive people to success. We should use this\u000aforce to help us.\u000a

Its a shame they did not get recognized by the\u000aacademy, but they should by now realize they were part of a\u000amasterpiece. most movies fade in interest when one watches them more\u000athan once, not Shawshank.

V\u000aEvery time I see this film, I am filled with dark thoughts which\u000aultimately gets overshadowed by hope. After all these years, this one\u000astill stands in number one list and one of my few reasons to join movie\u000aindustry. Well, so many things have been said and written, so I want to focus on\u000aone particular note-patience. Yes, friendship is the key theme of the\u000amovie that propels the plot till the very last shot of the film since\u000athe beginning of the narration but apart from the main theme of film\u000abeing hope and friendship, this film strongly con-notates the power of\u000apatience and persistence. Would not like to talk about the entire story here but next time you\u000awatch this, just take a close look at Andy, and the way he holds his\u000aemotion at the beginning in the court and till the very end when he\u000awears the polished shoe of Warden, no doubt there is deep sorrow and\u000aregret but above all, a sign of hope and his patience to make things\u000ahappen is always there throughout the movie-be it winning to get the\u000abooks, more books or even beer for his friends despite he doesn't drink\u000ahimself. Well, I always discover so many hidden subtle meanings every time I\u000awatch this, I loose track of the information and the key things but for\u000asure, apart of Hope and Friendship thing, patience and persistence tops\u000athe reason why is film is so courageous in its way.\u000a

It maybe an "old" movie,\u000adoesn't have special effects and stuff but i enjoyed every second of\u000athat movie. In two words brilliant and magnificent (I cant describe it\u000ain one word).It is about a man who never give up in what life throws at\u000ahim, but this is a little bit common. So what is that keeps "awake" on\u000aan almost 3 hour movie? Is the way that the movie flows, the dialogs,\u000ahumor and the mystery that keeps you "awake". In conclusion, i believe\u000athat it's a movie worth seeing no matter what. Tim Robbins and Morgan\u000aFreeman are great couple and remember that it's all about freedom.\u000a

V\u000aThe Shawshank Redemption is one of the greatest films ever made. Frank\u000aDarabont, known currently as the creator of The Walking Dead, created a\u000abeautiful and heartfelt film that has gone down in history as one of\u000athe best films ever. It's a brutal yet inspiring film that will give\u000ayou the deepest of feelings.Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman are great together and create chemistry\u000achemistry that is wonderful. See this film now, you will do yourself a\u000ahuge favour. - KT RockerfellerSeriously, watch it.OK?\u000a

V\u000aShawshank is an example of the beauty and power that great cinema can\u000aconj our. A deceptive film of prison life that contains violence,\u000ahumor, an extremely tear-jerking moment. A lot happens, yet the film\u000ajust seems to amble confidently along like the film's main character.\u000aThis film works on so many levels and definitely rewards repeated\u000aviewing. The cinematography and music are wonderful, as are the central\u000aperformances. Yet for all this it is the tale itself and how it is told\u000athat makes this (one of) the greatest stories ever told. People have\u000atheorized about what this film means ...is it an disguised story of\u000aJesus?...a simple tale of friendship?...a tale of corruption?...a\u000alecture on faith and 'holding on'?...or is the main character not who\u000awe think it to be for 3/4 of the film? After all there is one major\u000a'redemption' in this film: a man who has to decide whether "It's time\u000ato get busy dying, or get busy living". REDEEM YOURSELF, SEE THIS FILM.\u000a

V\u000aYes I'm 15 years old I've seen this movie once and that was almost a\u000ayear ago. After seeing this movie for the first time in my life I felt\u000alike a changed person. Yes everyone has hard times but this movie\u000ashowed me not only the power of hope but the power of friendship. It's funny my name is Andy my dad names me this because of the\u000ashawshank redemption and now I feel blessed to have that name. When\u000aAndy is brought to prison my first thought was he was a bad or even\u000aevil person. Over time that calmly slips away. I think what makes this the #1 movie of all time is the redemption\u000apart. Yes there are plenty of good movies about hope and change, but\u000athe great films such as shawshank convince you there will be a bad or\u000asad ending and it doesn't happen. I will show this to my kids whenever that happens I will wage tell\u000athere my age though not because of the violence or the rape or language\u000abut because when they see this I want them to understand it and love it\u000aand hopefully change them.\u000a

V\u000aYou don't get emotive, engaging story telling like this any more. Every\u000aaspect of the film, from the cinematography to the performances are top\u000anotch. The beauty of the film is that even the smaller characters have\u000aa story to tell, a journey to take you on, which seems to be completely\u000amissing in films now a days. Though Stephen King is normally associated\u000awith horror, this story is very human and touching, to the point where\u000ait becomes inspirational. In fact it has been King's non horror stories\u000athat seemed to have been most successful at being adapted into movies.\u000aThis movie along with Stand by Me, though I'm sure many will disagree\u000awith me on that point. Well worth a watch when you're having a quiet\u000anight in.\u000a

V\u000aHello Friends,This is my first review & i hope it will be useful. The Shawshank\u000aRedemption; as the name says, the movie is about the life of the\u000apeople, who had committed crimes in their life & suffering life\u000asentence. People in the prison are afraid of their every move in the\u000ajail due to the kind of punishments what they have suffered in the\u000apast.During then an innocent banker, who has been charged for Murder of his\u000awife & her Boyfriend enters the premises. He will soon became good\u000afriend with Morgan Freeman. Due to his pro-activeness & intelligence,\u000ahe will soon become the mentor for all the staff including warden for\u000atheir IT woes.He will also expand the Library for the prisoners which gives them a\u000awhole new different life. During this time, a young boy, who enters the\u000ajail and will soon becomes the part of the team along with Tim &\u000aMorgan. From whom, Tim will get to know the proof for his innocence. So\u000awhen explained this to warden, he calls this young kid for a private\u000adiscussion & kills him. Even then Tim will not lose hope. With the help\u000aof a small hammer & the Lady poster which he brought from Morgan, he\u000acontinuously did the drilling of the wall for 20 years.At the right time, he escapes through the wall, followed by stinking\u000acrawling in the gutter for 500yards, along with other Major bank\u000adocuments of his Warden, he then escapes the prison & starts the new\u000alife by exposing the reality of Shwashank & its operations.By doing all this he creates HOPE in the mind of the people that, there\u000ais lot awaiting outside, rather than what is left behind the four\u000aconcrete walls. He says to Morgan, Hope is the best thing that a Man\u000acan Have.\u000a

I seriously\u000aquestion people's tastes if they don't at least acknowledge the fact\u000athis was a brilliant movie. They don't have to like it ( which I find\u000aout pretty rare ) but they have to admit, they acting was great.\u000aWriting this review makes me want to watch it again.

V\u000aThe Shawshank Redemption has always been one of my favorite films to\u000awatch. I was introduced to this movie by my dad, who has always been a\u000ahuge fan of the film. I didn't think at first I would have liked the\u000amovie, but I was wrong. Tim Robbins plays a character called Andy; who\u000awas sentenced to prison for committing a crime he never committed. Tim\u000aRobbins did a remarkable job of playing Andy. Andy had this attitude\u000aabout him that captured the audience in a special way. He was always so\u000acalm, and although he had been put in prison for something he didn't do\u000aand, was treated horribly by some of his fellow inmates; he still\u000aremained a humble individual. He didn't let these actions of others\u000aaffect his life. He knew he didn't do anything wrong. He knew what kind\u000aof a man he was, and he wanted out of prison. Morgan Freeman played "Red" a character whom Andy befriended in prison.\u000aJust like the audience watching the film, Red was always drawn to Andy.\u000aAndy always kept Red guessing of what was to come. I always enjoyed the\u000arelationship shared between Andy and Red. It's the kind of friendship\u000ayou'd want with someone-even given the circumstances in which they were\u000aliving. Eventually, Andy devised a plan and escaped Shawshank. Red\u000aeventually was let out of prison and went on to find Andy. This was\u000aanother one of my favorite parts of the movie; not only the fact that\u000aAndy escaped from the prison in which he didn't belong but Red and him\u000awere reunited. I think in the end despite the fact that Red and Andy\u000awere prison inmates; everyone was on their side. They had never really\u000aseemed like they belonged in prison. They seemed like they were good\u000apeople. Above all I believed after so long some people just learn their\u000alesson and deserve to be sent home. This film is truly amazing and\u000anever gets old for me. There will never be another one quite like it.\u000a

V\u000aI'm a guy that takes pride on the fact of being quite open-minded when\u000ait comes to appreciating different genres and kinds of stories. I love\u000amovies that faithfully and movingly depict the ugly side of humanity,\u000abut every now and then I also like something that tells us that not\u000aeverything is lost.The Shawshank Redemption introduces us to Andy Dufresne. A gentile yet\u000aemotionally estranged banker who's wrongfully accused of murdering his\u000awife and her lover. This brings him to a gruesome prison were his will\u000ato maintain his humanity will be put to the test by the corrupt and\u000aabusive authorities of the prison, and also by some of his fellow\u000ainmates. In this bleak scenario he will find hope in the guise of\u000afriendship. Which will push him to rise above the situation.This movie is all about hope. About the power of friendship and the\u000areluctance to give up on life, even under the darkest circumstances.\u000aEven locked in a pit of pure evil, human spirit can be enough to lift\u000ayou up.Tim Robbins is convincing and moving in his performance, although he is\u000aoutshone by a brilliant Morgan Freeman, who always seems to\u000aeffortlessly touch the soul of the audience with his performances. The\u000abad guys also generate the right amount of repulsion, with a good job\u000afrom Bob Gunton as the morally questionable warden and Clancy Brown in\u000athe memorable role of the violent and vicious captain Hadley.I've seen some reviews questioning the placement of this film as #1 for\u000aIMDb users. I don't think any of us can put a movie above all the rest\u000aor below them. Art is subject to personal appreciation and there will\u000anever be a single opinion more valuable than the rest. What's\u000aundeniable is that Shawshank caused what it intended. Moving the\u000amajority of people that have seen it through a beautiful story that\u000aaims to the human spirit and it's power to shed light in the darkest\u000amoments.\u000a

V\u000aAndy Dufresne, a successful banker is convicted for the murder of his\u000awife and her lover. At first, it is hard for him to get used to it on\u000athe inside, but when he meets Red, the guy who can get it for you, they\u000abecome friends and they work their problems out together. The guards\u000aseem to like Andy after he helped Captain Hadley with his tax issues.\u000aThey give Andy more privileges. They let him write letters, help the\u000aguards during Tax Season, build the Shawshank Prison Library, and teach\u000aother prisoners education. But when the new inmate Tommy, who was one\u000aof Andy's classmates for reading, is shot by Captain Hadley, Andy feels\u000ait's time for him to escape with the help of his friend Red. He tells\u000aRed that when he escapes, he plans to move down to Zihuatanejo. He\u000atells Red that when he finally is released from the prison, he wants\u000ahim to move with him. Red agrees. So then on a stormy night, Andy used\u000aa rock hammer to tunnel through the cement wall. Then he crawls through\u000aa sewer tunnel 500 yards long out to a creek. Then shortly afterwards,\u000aCaptain Hadley is taken to prison after shooting the inmate Tommy, and\u000aNorton the Warden shoots himself after he sees Captain Hadley being\u000ataken away.

This movie will make\u000ayou feel for each character. you will happy and sad all at the same\u000atime. If you have not seen this movie yet, you must. It is my #1 movie.\u000aI can't say it is best for kids, due to some scenes. This film manages\u000ato redeem Hollywood in the eyes of people who feared it long lost in a\u000adark sea of clichés and predictability. Darabont shows us that artists\u000astill work in the Hollywood studios and production facilities. These\u000aartists show their capability to produce art; real art that inspires\u000ayou to look at the deeper aspects of life and the world around you. The\u000aShawshank Redemption delivers much-needed breath of fresh air for\u000aanyone who realizes the capability of film. It proves that masters of\u000athe craft still live on this earth, and still bless us with timeless\u000amasterpieces that we will never forget.\u000a

V\u000aIn 1946, a banker named Andy Dufresne (Tim Robbins) is convicted of a\u000adouble murder, even though he stubbornly proclaims his innocence. He's\u000asentenced to a life term at the Shawshank State Prison in Maine, where\u000aanother lifer, Ellis "Red" Redding (Morgan Freeman), picks him as the\u000anew recruit most likely to crack under the pressure. The ugly realities\u000aof prison life are quickly introduced to Andy: a corrupt warden (Bob\u000aGunton), sadistic guards led by Capt. Byron Hadley (Clancy Brown), and\u000ainmates who are little better than animals, willing to use rape or\u000abeatings to insure their dominance. But Andy does not crack: he has the\u000ahope of the truly innocent, which (together with his smarts) allow him\u000ato prevail behind bars. He uses his banking skills to win favor with\u000athe warden and the guards, doing the books for Norton's illegal\u000abusiness schemes and keeping an eye on the investments of most of the\u000aprison staff. In exchange, he is able to improve the prison library and\u000abring some dignity and respect back to many of the inmates, including\u000aRed. Based on a story by Stephen King, The Shawshank Redemption was the\u000adirectorial debut of screenwriter Frank Darabont. ~ Mark Deming, Rovi\u000a

V\u000a"The Shawshank Redemption" is very entertaining, and quite possibly the\u000agreatest prison film of all-time.Based on the Stephen King's novel of the same name, the film shows what\u000ahappens to Andy Dufresne (Tim Robbins) after he is ordered to prison\u000afor a double murder that he did not commit. Much of the film story\u000arevolves around Andy and the friendships he makes in the barbarous\u000aenvironment that is a prison.It the best films from the 90s but "The Shawshank Redemption" for me\u000atrails "The Lion King","Forest Gump", "Pulp Fiction" & possibly even\u000a"Leon: The Professional" for best films of 1994. As well as this the\u000afilm, can be in some parts slow and be a bit boring.Despite this, the film is enjoyable and has some scenes that truly hit\u000ayou hard (Brooks' release). It is good but overrated\u000a

V\u000aIt is a strange comment to make about a film set inside a prison, but\u000a"The Shawshank Redemption" creates a warm hold on our feelings because\u000ait makes us a member of a family. Many movies offer us vicarious\u000aexperiences and quick, superficial emotions. "Shawshank" slows down and\u000alooks. It uses the narrator's calm, observant voice to include us in\u000athe story of men who have formed a community behind bars. It is deeper\u000athan most films; about continuity in a lifetime, based on friendship\u000aand hope.Interesting that although the hero of the film is the convicted former\u000abanker Andy Dufresne (Tim Robbins), the action is never seen from his\u000apoint of view. The film's opening scene shows him being given two life\u000asentences for the murder of his wife and her lover, and then we move,\u000apermanently, to a point of view representing the prison population and\u000aparticularly the lifer Ellis 'Red' Redding (Morgan Freeman). It is his\u000avoice remembering the first time he saw Andy ("looked like a stiff\u000abreeze would blow him over"), and predicting, wrongly, that he wouldn't\u000amake it in prison.From Andy's arrival on the prison bus to the film's end, we see only\u000ahow others see him - Red, who becomes his best friend, Brooks the old\u000alibrarian, the corrupt Warden Norton, guards and prisoners. Red is our\u000asurrogate. He's the one we identify with, and the redemption, when it\u000acomes, is Red's. We've been shown by Andy's example that you have to\u000akeep true to yourself, not lose hope, bide your time, set a quiet\u000aexample and look for your chance. "I guess it comes down to a simple\u000achoice, really," he tells Red. "Get busy livin' or get busy dyin'."The key to the film's structure, I think, is that it's not about its\u000ahero, but about our relationship with him - our curiosity, our pity,\u000aour admiration. If Andy had been the heroic center, bravely enduring,\u000athe film would have been conventional, and less mysterious. But we\u000awonder about this guy. Did he really kill those two people? Why does he\u000akeep so much to himself? Why can he amble through the prison yard like\u000aa free man on a stroll, when everyone else plods or sidles?People like excitement at the movies, and titles that provide it do\u000awell. Films about "redemption" are approached with great wariness; a\u000alot of people are not thrilled by the prospect of a great film - it\u000asounds like work. But there's a hunger for messages of hope, and when a\u000afilm offers one, it's likely to have staying power even if it doesn't\u000agrab an immediate audience."The Shawshank Redemption" premiered at the Toronto Film Festival in\u000aSeptember 1994, and opened a few weeks later. It got good reviews but\u000adid poor business (its $18 million original gross didn't cover costs;\u000ait took in only another $10 million after winning seven Oscar\u000anominations, including best picture).\u000a

V\u000aEasily the best movie I have ever seen. No matter what genres you're\u000ainto you'll love this movie. Whenever someone asks me for a movie\u000arecommendation, this is my first suggestion every time! Morgan Freeman\u000aand all the other actors played absolutely amazing. The music in this\u000amovie is just unbelievable, it's just incredible how well the people\u000abehind this movie managed to make the music highlight the mood. If you\u000atake the time to notice the music, you'll understand why it made such a\u000adifference for me. And when it comes to the story I have absolutely no\u000awords. 'Great!' or even 'Fantastic!' won't come close to my experience\u000athe first time I saw it. I think I was about 14. I didn't understand\u000aall of the stuff, and why it happened, but I still thought it was the\u000agreatest movie of all time. When I saw it again, a few years later, it\u000awas even better. This is one of the types of movies that you can see a\u000aton of times and keeps getting better. You can see it one time as a kid\u000aand see one moral behind the story, and see it as an adult and see a\u000awhole other movie. So if you still hasn't watched the movie, you can't\u000ago wrong with The Shawshank Redemption.\u000a

V\u000aI have to say: Yes, it is a great movie, but it came directly from a\u000ashort story wrote by Stephen King, Rita Hayworth and the Shawshank\u000aRedemption...so if you read the story after the movie you'll find that\u000abasically they use it as a script because there is not modification at\u000aall. So the movie was good but did not received any big price due to in\u000athis year it was in the same Oscar with Forrest Gump and Pulp Fiction.\u000aThe story is very dramatic and started when a very smart bank vice\u000apresident is sent to prison because was found guilty in court to kill\u000ahis wife and her lover. In prison he would be facing very strong\u000asituations as a smart accountant he is bringing a new face to the\u000aprison and to his life.The director Frank Darabont also was in charge of the Script.\u000a

V\u000aLooking back at old classics , I remembered that I forgot to watch this\u000aawesome movie.When I watched it , my heart stopped a bit making me feel\u000alike that how I missed such a movie.First of all , the acting of Morgan\u000aFreeman and Tim Robbins was above extraordinary.How Tim finds a new\u000alife to get out when the world seems dark is a masterpiece concept\u000aincluding his dialogue delivering at instances when depressing actions\u000aoccur from him.So, guys just watch it.Morgan Freeman is known for his acting in movies like Wanted.He also\u000aplayed an important part in this movie.He played the role of a friend\u000ato Tim Robbins.together how they work with each other is a thing that\u000ais to be watched.bond knows no boundaries.I will not go about the\u000aplot.But a deep level realizing the characters has to be there\u000a

V\u000aI have watched this film many times and I never feel bored. It is a\u000akind of film that make you feel that human has the potential to go\u000athrough all kinds of suffering. It makes you feel the strength within\u000ahuman spirit and hope that never dies. After you see what the main\u000acharacter did, you come and look at your life and find that it is not\u000athat hard, we can keep on trying a little more. Impossible things can\u000abe possible. Spirit doesn't have to be broken by cruelty or hardship.When I watched it, I would think "look at him, for all those years of\u000abeing imprisoned without doing wrong, for all those times of going\u000athrough evil people that treat him harshly, this man never gives up\u000afighting, never give up hoping and trying to find his freedom, and he\u000amade it, and his strength even brought back the life and hope of\u000aanother person" Then, I would think...why don't I be more patient and\u000akeep trying with my life, keep trying for my dream. Just do it again\u000aand again, and one day I will get to where I want to be.Excellent film in every element of it. It's exciting, touching, and\u000amoving. Highly recommended for all who have not watched. It's a\u000amust-see for everyone.\u000a

V\u000aThe movie just captivates the viewer from start to finish. Morgan\u000aFreeman as "Red" is just perfect and gets the viewers attention from\u000athe start. Just a great story, told in a smooth line and stays\u000ainteresting. Plot twists, double crossings, pin-up posters are all\u000athere. The book written by Stephen King adapts well to the screen and\u000ait deserves all the credit that is due. Its a long movie, which never\u000agets old and never gets boring. Some well known actors are included,\u000afamiliar faces and new faces. This movie has it all. In abundance.\u000aThere is a reason I am a huge fan of Morgan Freeman and this movie was\u000apretty much the start of it all. A brilliant actor, a compelling story,\u000awhat more can you ask for in a movie that is set in a prison. Shear\u000abrilliance.\u000a

V\u000aEven though it may seem a film devoid of complexities of real life, it\u000ais at the end of the day one of the best depictions of a tale about\u000afriendship, hope and a strong sense of humanity. This movie may get\u000aslow at the middle but if one can just sit back and watch, it makes the\u000afinal part of the movie that much more satisfying.The main reason for\u000athis movie being so wonderful is that it succeeds in all aspects that\u000amatter. The acting is nothing short of magnificent. No other set of\u000aactors could have depicted the characters in the movie with the\u000asubtlety required. Spectacular acting by Morgan Freeman and Tim Robbins\u000amakes it one of the best movies ever made.\u000a

V\u000aThere are standard ways to stage a prison film and standard ways to\u000atell a story by Stephen King. But "The Shawshank Redemption," based on\u000aa King novella and set in the correctional institution of the title,\u000asucceeds in avoiding the familiar.Without a single riot scene or horrific effect, it tells a slow, gentle\u000astory of camaraderie and growth, with an ending that abruptly finds\u000apoetic justice in what has come before. The writer and director, Frank\u000aDarabont, tells this tale with a surprising degree of loving care.There are times when "The Shawshank Redemption" comes dangerously close\u000ato sounding one of those "triumph of the human spirit" notes. But most\u000aof it is eloquently restrained. Despite an excess of voice-over\u000anarration and inspirational music, Mr. Darabont's film has a genuine\u000adignity that holds the interest. It is helped greatly by fine,\u000acircumspect performances from Morgan Freeman as a rueful lifer named\u000aRed and Tim Robbins as Andy, the new kid on the cellblock. The film\u000aspans nearly 20 years of friendship between these two.When Andy is convicted of his wife's murder, the judge pronounces him\u000a"a particularly remorseless and icy man." He sustains that chill when\u000ahe first arrives at Shawshank, remaining aloof from other inmates even\u000awhen those inmates threaten him with physical harm. "I wish I could\u000atell you that Andy fought the good fight," says Red, who knows Andy has\u000abeen gang-raped by fellow prisoners, in one of the film's only\u000ahalfway-brutal episodes. "I wish I could tell you that, but prison is\u000ano fairy-tale world."Needless to say, the heroes of such stories usually do succeed in\u000adefending themselves, at least when Hollywood is telling the fairy\u000atale. But "The Shawshank Redemption" has its own brand of iconoclasm,\u000awith Mr. Darabont's direction as quiet, purposeful and secretive as\u000aAndy is himself.Eventually Andy begins to fit in, especially after he wows the guards\u000awith skills left over from his pre-prison banking career. From the\u000afirst time he advises one guard to make a one-time-only tax-free gift\u000ato his wife, Andy gets a new lease on life as "a convicted murderer who\u000aprovides sound financial planning."Andy does special fiscal favors for the warden. ("You know, the funny\u000athing is, on the outside I was an honest man, straight as an arrow," he\u000asays about this. "I had to come to prison to be a crook.") He also\u000amakes the occasional dramatic gesture, like commandeering the prison's\u000aloudspeaker and playing a Mozart aria for all his fellow inmates. The\u000afilm has a tendency to wax romantic at such moments, but more often it\u000asustains an intelligent reserve.Mr. Freeman is so quietly impressive here that there's reason to wish\u000aRed's role had more range. As written, he spends his time observing\u000aAndy fondly and describing prison life. But Mr. Freeman's commanding\u000apresence makes him a much stronger figure than that. Mr. Freeman is\u000aespecially moving when he suggests how dependent Red has become on the\u000aprison walls that give shape to his life. Even so, Red has kept his\u000aruefulness. "Only guilty man in Shawshank," he jokes about himself.Mr. Robbins has the trickier role of someone whose still waters run\u000adeep, but whose experience doesn't add up until an exposition-packed\u000adenouement. (The film's swift, enjoyably far-fetched closing scenes are\u000aa sharp reminder of who is the author of this story, after all.) Andy's\u000ais the more subdued role, but Mr. Robbins plays it intensely, and he\u000aages effectively from newcomer to father figure during the story. One\u000aof Andy's projects is improving the prison library, which once\u000acontained nothing but the equivalent of books by Stephen King.To raise funds for this undertaking, Andy is steady and patient,\u000awriting weekly letters to state officials until he gets what he wants.\u000aMr. Darabont, a screenwriter making an impressive directorial debut,\u000aworks in much the same quietly persistent way. "The Shawshank\u000aConspiracy" takes shape slowly and carefully, displaying an overall\u000asubtlety that's surprising in a movie of this genre. In the end, like\u000aAndy and Red, it gets to where it wanted to go."The Shawshank Redemption" is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying\u000aparent or adult guardian). It includes profanity and occasional\u000aviolence, including a scene that discreetly suggests homosexual rape.THE SHAWSHANK REDEMPTION Written and directed by Frank Darabont, based\u000aon the novella "Rita Hayworth and the Shawshank Redemption," by Stephen\u000aKing; director of photography, Roger Deakins; edited by Richard\u000aFrancis- Bruce; music by Tom Newman; production designer, Terence\u000aMarsh; produced by Niki Marvin; released by Columbia Pictures. Running\u000atime: 142 minutes. This film is rated R. WITH: Morgan Freeman (Red),\u000aTim Robbins (Andy), Gil Bellows (Tommy), Clancy Brown (Captain Hadley),\u000aBob Gunton (Warden Norton), Mark Rolston (Bogs Diamond), William Sadler\u000a(Heywood) and James Whitmore (Brooks Hatlen).\u000a

Neverless, if I can add my opinion, it could be that\u000afor me, the Shawnshank Redemption, is among the top ten best films\u000aever. This movie deals with the conditions in the different jails around the\u000aworld through the story of an incredible character plaid by Tim Robbins\u000aat the top of his art.If I can give you an advice it could be to look this film as soon as\u000apossible.

V\u000aA saw this movie, and it was truly amazing. This movie has all what a\u000amovie needs. I love it. The movie is about a man who gets unfair put in\u000ajail. Here he meets a man whom he befriends. After many years he turns\u000agradually to life in prison. But that does not prevent him for his plan\u000ato escape. He makes accounting for the prison director as he once was a\u000abanker. Warden becomes dependent on him, and doing all that he never\u000agets out of prison. But he is a very smart man and he thinks about\u000aeverything.Morgan Freeman is the companion he meets in prison, tells the story.\u000aAnd with his deep credible voice, you assume right into the story. The\u000awhole movie is just amazing. And it is well thought out down to the\u000asmallest detail.\u000a

V\u000aShawshank is unique in the genre and unlocked a new potential for movie\u000amakers to break the inherent confines of a prison picture. So why is\u000aShawshank so popular and tops many best movie lists? Not hard to figure\u000aout. The entertainment value is high and our empathy is heightened for\u000aAndy and Red. It is deeper than most films; about continuity in a\u000alifetime, based on friendship and hope. Interesting that although the\u000ahero of the film is the convicted former banker Andy Dufresne (Tim\u000aRobbins), the action is never seen from his point of view. We move,\u000apermanently, to a point of view representing the prison population and\u000aparticularly Ellis 'Red' Redding (Morgan Freeman). From Andy's arrival\u000aon the prison bus to the film's end, we see only how others see him -\u000aRed, who becomes his best friend, Brooks the old librarian, the corrupt\u000aWarden Norton, guards and prisoners. Red is our surrogate. He's the one\u000awe identify with, and the redemption, when it comes, is Red's. We've\u000abeen shown by Andy's example that you have to keep true to yourself,\u000anot lose hope, bide your time, set a quiet example and look for your\u000achance. "I guess it comes down to a simple choice, really," he tells\u000aRed. "Get busy livin' or get busy dyin'."\u000a

The main actor was convicted for a crime he did\u000anot but that from the beginning he was planning his escape from prison\u000a, trying to get in trust with the chief of the prison and the guards\u000aalso well felicitated the realization of his plan . In addition to\u000aplanning his escape he helped a lot in prison who was convicted, to\u000apeople that it was with him, and also built a library. Spent many years\u000aworking to excavate the tunnel to escape , managed to free himself from\u000athat place leaving evidence that the head of the prison was a criminal\u000awho was arrested by the police . Before his escape , he left some clues\u000afor " best friend " with which he was sentenced for them to meet when\u000athe second out of prison . This story is very exciting and for those\u000awho did not see this movie should do it because it makes us think about\u000aour life and we have to cherish every moment .\u000a

From the lighting to\u000ascore, one cannot help but appreciate this fine example of a powerful\u000aadaptation at its finest. It is a beautiful piece of history and takes\u000aits place among the best. Even the pacing of the story is well placed\u000ato give a sense of hopelessness within the prison, but not dragging on\u000aand prolonging confinement. The creativity and originality behind this\u000aleaves viewers in awe of a great film.\u000a

V\u000aThe Shawshank Redemption is a 1994 American drama film written and\u000adirected by Frank Darabont and starring Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman.Adapted from the Stephen King novella Rita Hayworth and Shawshank\u000aRedemption, the film tells the story of Andy Dufresne, a banker who\u000aspends 19 years in Shawshank State Prison for the murder of his wife\u000aand her lover despite his claims of innocence. During his time at the\u000aprison, he befriends a fellow inmate, Ellis Boyd "Red" Redding, and\u000afinds himself protected by the guards after the warden begins using him\u000ain his money laundering operation.Despite a lukewarm box office reception that barely recouped its\u000abudget, the film received multiple award nominations and favorable\u000areviews from critics for its acting and realism. It has since enjoyed a\u000aremarkable life on cable television, VHS, DVD, and Blu-ray. It was\u000aincluded in the American Film Institute's 100 Years...100 Movies 10th\u000aAnniversary Edition.

V\u000aNothing to say regarding this movie. Yea best of the best. No action, no special effects - just men in prison uniforms talking to\u000aeach other.Frank Darabont didn't need to put any kind of outlandish special\u000aeffects to get us to love this film, the narration and the acting does\u000athat for him. Why this movie didn't win all seven Oscars is beyond me,\u000abut don't let that sway you to not see this film, let its ranking on\u000athe IMDb's top 250 list sway you.The Shawshank Redemption served as a message of hope to Hollywood as\u000awell. More than any film in memory, it proved there is life after box\u000aoffice. Besting Forrest and Fiction, it ran solely on strong word of\u000amouth and became the hottest rented film of 1995Thank you.\u000a

V\u000aThis movie is based on a novel by Stephen King, but don't let that put\u000ayou off. It's not a horror film, rather a thumpingly good ode to\u000afriendship, hope, wit, wiles and wisdom, brimming with crackling\u000acharacters and topped with the most twisteroo of twists since The\u000aCrying Game. Found guilty of killing his unfaithful wife and her lover\u000ain a fit of passion, sullen accountant Andy Dufresne (Robbins, casting\u000aoff his goof ball image to display more layers than the proverbial\u000aonion) is shipped to the Gothic wind-swept corridors of the Shawshank\u000aState Prison for life. It is here the movie gracefully unfolds. With a\u000abeautifully rounded script, writer/director Darabont conjures up a\u000aspellbinding personal odyssey stretching through the years from 1946 to\u000a1967. Dufresne, all the while protesting his innocence, slowly overcomes the\u000ahellfire tortures of the prison system - an unblinking range of\u000abeatings, rapings and abject humiliations - while managing to inspire\u000ahis fellow inmates to lift their degraded horizons. Among them is Red\u000a(Freeman, in a matchless supporting role), the lifer who can, given\u000atime, provide virtually anything. And for reasons best known to\u000ahimself, Dufresne requires 40s starlet Rita Hayworth, provisioned in\u000aposter form. The mood swings rigorously through every emotion as the cranky, wiseguy\u000aand downright crazed array of criminals bare the brunt of the turbulent\u000alife within the doomy Shawshank catacomb. Then it gets really mean,\u000agearing up for its injury-time shockers. Dufresne, a whiz with figures,\u000ais bullied into running the warden's (Gunton) petty accounting scams,\u000agiving him the chance to execute his and the film's final, greatest\u000amiracle. If you're miserable enough to look for gripes then, yes, it does drift\u000aon too long and who needs prison buggery again? Yet the ending has such\u000apoetic completeness you're too busy contentedly chuckling to worry\u000aabout sore behinds. This may have confounded American audiences - it\u000aflopped big-time on planet Yank - but a more divine movie experience\u000ayou will not find this side of Oscardom. Spread the word.\u000a

V\u000aThe first time that I saw this movie was in my film class last semester\u000ain college. The teacher was supposed to play Pulp Fiction and changed\u000ahis mind at the last minute. Most of us we're not very happy and didn't\u000awant to see a 2+ hour film about a guy in prison. When the movie let\u000aout everybody literally cheered. Shawshank has the amazing ability that\u000amost films lack to grab our attentions and keep it for such a long\u000alength of time. It also has the ability to make out spirits soar unlike\u000aany other film. No matter how low you are, when you are done watching\u000aShawshank you are ready to fly. Amazing acting, flawless directing and\u000aa perfect story make this film a must see for anybody who enjoys\u000amovies. A perfect 10!\u000a

V\u000aThis movie has got to be one of my all time favorites. At one point i\u000ahad a broken DVD player and this DVD was stuck in the machine for\u000aalmost a whole summer. Didn't even matter to me because it just gave me\u000aa great excuse to watch this wonderful movie over and over again. I\u000awill never not love this movie. Morgan Freeman's voice and character\u000aalone never failed to warm my bones. Shawshank is overall a classic that will be around for years to come.\u000aIt encompasses many moral values that most people don't think twice\u000aabout. It's got crazy and heart sulking relationships, and you will\u000ahave no other choice but to empathize with the main character. If you haven't seen this glorious film yet you must lock yourself in a\u000aroom somewhere until you witness this amazing classic.\u000a

In terms of the acting, the screen-writing,\u000athe directing, the music, the plot and its various sub-plots... The\u000astory in general is heart-warming and inspiring, portraying both the\u000abest and the worst of mankind. There are few films that I can watch\u000aover and over again without getting bored, but Shawshank Redemption\u000amore than any other movie does that for me. Even when I watch it for\u000athe umpteenth time at some point in 2014, I can guarantee that I will\u000astill feel the same goosebumps when Andy memorably advises Red to 'get\u000abusy living' or get busy dying', and the same upsurge of warmth,\u000aemotion, happiness and relief when Red is finally granted parole and he\u000are-unites with Andy in the final scene.

V\u000aSo in the beginning I wasn't anticipated to watch this movie. I judged\u000ait would be slow, uninteresting, and overrated with people jumping the\u000abandwagon of how good it was. But as I was seeing how the movie was\u000aunfolding, I was surprised to see how interesting it really was. There\u000awasn't a dull moment of it. I was pleased with how the ending made me\u000afeel. I think the big thing about this movie is how it captures your\u000aemotions. The actors were great, and the story was great too. Overall I\u000agive it a 9.5. But I do think this is one of the best movies I've ever\u000awatched. It is definitely in my top three. Don't let the title stop you\u000afrom watching it if it sounds boring to you. This is a movie I would\u000awatch over and over again. It does live up to the hype.\u000a

People like excitement at\u000athe movies, and this is the movie with good life lesson, offers the\u000ahope, the great feeling.. It is not about the story, its all about that\u000afeeling, when you are in your sofa, watching the movie 2 hours.. and\u000aafter the movie ends, you stand up and say: What a movie!And what is the best, watching the film again, you admire it even more\u000athan the first time you saw it.

V\u000aThis movie is not just brilliant but it's rather a thumpingly good ode\u000ato friendship, hope, wit, wiles and wisdom, brimming with crackling\u000acharacters and topped with the most twisteroo of twists since The\u000aCrying Game. Found guilty of killing his unfaithful wife and her lover\u000ain a fit of passion, sullen accountant Andy Dufresne (Robbins, casting\u000aoff his goofball image to display more layers than the proverbial\u000aonion) is shipped to the Gothic wind-swept corridors of the Shawshank\u000aState Prison for life. It is here the movie gracefully unfolds. With a\u000abeautifully rounded script, writer/director Darabont conjures up a\u000aspellbinding personal odyssey stretching through the years. want to\u000aknow more go watch it.\u000a

V\u000aThe Shawshank Redemption isn't your average movie with big explosions,\u000agun fights, or super heroes instead its just a simple movie about a\u000afriendship that forms between two prisoners each serving a life\u000asentence for murder. My favorite thing about the movie is all of the\u000aremember able quotes that you can take from it. Mine is a conversation\u000abetween the district attorney and Andy Dufresne (Tim Robbins) the\u000aconversation goes like this District Attorney: "And that also is very\u000aconvenient, isn't it, Mr. Dufresne"? Andy: "Since I am innocent of this\u000acrime, sir, I find it decidedly inconvenient that the gun was never\u000afound." Out of all of the amazing quotes from this movie this is my\u000afavorite because it says early in the film the this character can be\u000afunny even at his own murder trial and he can be a little sarcastic to.\u000aAnother reason I really enjoyed the film was watching how the writers\u000aof the movie developed the relationship of Red (Morgan Freeman) and\u000aAndy overtime. The first time Red saw Andy he says "I didn't think much\u000aof Andy the first time I saw him", but they would develop a very strong\u000afriendship as the movie goes on. Every character in this movie is\u000adifferent from any other character in someway. Red is seems to be wise,\u000anice, and doesn't ever stress out ever. Andy is clever, smart, and what\u000aseems to be a good person. Warden Norton seems to be evil,\u000amanipulative, and controlling. Something that is a bit ironic from this\u000amovie is that most the prisoners seem to nice guys while Norton and the\u000aguards seem to be the real criminals I thought it was inserting that\u000amakers of the movie decided to kind of change the ways we are used to\u000aseeing things. The thing the movie shows the best is that with time\u000aeverything can change for example Andy was once just a banker until he\u000ahe went to prison and meet Red which probably was the most meaningful\u000athing he ever did in his life. Although the story may look like your\u000asame old prison movie its not it has many unexpected twist through out\u000athe whole movie. Most films you watch today just focus on action and\u000abig name actors but, this isn't one of those movies it gives real\u000aattention to the story being to told and even two friends talking in\u000athe prison yard will have you on the edge of your seat and wondering\u000awhat is going to happen next. This is one of those movie you watch 5\u000atimes and still enjoyed it and catch something new you hadn't noticed\u000abefore. This movie will be talked about for many many more years ahead\u000aand will never get old. The Shawshank Redemption was nominated more 7\u000aOscars and in my opinion has the best acting of any film I have ever\u000aseen. So if you feel like taking a break from your normal blockbuster\u000amovie and sees and movie that tells a great story of hope and\u000afriendship then I would highly recommend watching this movie.\u000a

V\u000aTo me this is one of the best told prison movies ever made. After\u000awatching the Blue Ray Version - it is more than a prison movie too.\u000aWhile Morgan Freeman's performance and narration are tour DE force, the\u000asupport cast is outstanding. Even the ancient James Whitmore has a good\u000arole in this one.I noted on the credits that Steven King contributed to his writing\u000abeing converted into a movie. There is no doubt this one benefits from\u000athat. Tim Robbins is at the top of his game here too. Frank Darabont\u000adirects and writes this movie and the viewer gets the feeling that the\u000adirector pictured how the story should be told when he wrote it along\u000awith when he directed it.This movie is the ultimate trip about injustice and justice within the\u000aprison system. It draws deep characters for each role which seem to\u000atake advantage of each cast members skills. It also is a the ultimate\u000atriumph over despair. Bob Gunton gets kudos from here for his role as\u000athe warden.When your looking for a movie to watch, there are few to beat this\u000apicture as this one just turned out perfect. If every film were this\u000awell done, they would all be best pictures.\u000a

V\u000aThe Shawshank Redemption is an uplifting, deeply satisfying prison\u000adrama with sensitive direction and fine performances.Darabont\u000aconstructs the film to observe the story, not to punch it up or upstage\u000ait. Upstaging, in fact, is unknown in this film; the actors are content\u000ato stay within their roles, the story moves in an orderly way, and the\u000afilm itself reflects the slow passage of the decades. "When they put\u000ayou in that cell," Red says, "when those bars slam home, that's when\u000ayou know it's for real. Old life blown away in the blink of an eye.\u000aNothing left but all the time in the world to think about it." Watching\u000athe film again, I admired it even more than the first time I saw it.\u000aAffection for good films often grows with familiarity, as it does with\u000amusic. Some have said life is a prison, we are Red, Andy is our\u000aredeemer. All good art is about something deeper than it admits.\u000a

V\u000aIt is a strange comment to make about a film set inside a prison, but\u000a"The Shawshank Redemption" creates a warm hold on our feelings because\u000ait makes us a member of a family. Many movies offer us vicarious\u000aexperiences and quick, superficial emotions. "Shawshank" slows down and\u000alooks. It uses the narrator's calm, observant voice to include us in\u000athe story of men who have formed a community behind bars. It is deeper\u000athan most films; about continuity in a lifetime, based on friendship\u000aand hope.Interesting that although the hero of the film is the convicted former\u000abanker Andy Dufresne (Tim Robbins), the action is never seen from his\u000apoint of view. The film's opening scene shows him being given two life\u000asentences for the murder of his wife and her lover, and then we move,\u000apermanently, to a point of view representing the prison population and\u000aparticularly the lifer Ellis 'Red' Redding (Morgan Freeman). It is his\u000avoice remembering the first time he saw Andy ("looked like a stiff\u000abreeze would blow him over"), and predicting, wrongly, that he wouldn't\u000amake it in prison.From Andy's arrival on the prison bus to the film's end, we see only\u000ahow others see him - Red, who becomes his best friend, Brooks the old\u000alibrarian, the corrupt Warden Norton, guards and prisoners. Red is our\u000asurrogate. He's the one we identify with, and the redemption, when it\u000acomes, is Red's. We've been shown by Andy's example that you have to\u000akeep true to yourself, not lose hope, bide your time, set a quiet\u000aexample and look for your chance. "I guess it comes down to a simple\u000achoice, really," he tells Red. "Get busy living' or get busy dying'."The key to the film's structure, I think, is that it's not about its\u000ahero, but about our relationship with him - our curiosity, our pity,\u000aour admiration. If Andy had been the heroic center, bravely enduring,\u000athe film would have been conventional, and less mysterious. But we\u000awonder about this guy. Did he really kill those two people? Why does he\u000akeep so much to himself? Why can he amble through the prison yard like\u000aa free man on a stroll, when everyone else plods or sidles?People like excitement at the movies, and titles that provide it do\u000awell. Films about "redemption" are approached with great wariness; a\u000alot of people are not thrilled by the prospect of a great film - it\u000asounds like work. But there's a hunger for messages of hope, and when a\u000afilm offers one, it's likely to have staying power even if it doesn't\u000agrab an immediate audience.\u000a

V\u000aThe Shawshank Redemption Is one of the best movie i ever seen. The\u000apatience of a person no one could ever imagine and all about\u000ahope.simply its great.The character of Tim Robbins are good but the\u000aVoice of Morgan freeman is magical and made this film classical and the\u000awhole story line is awesome...the whole cinematic and direction is too\u000agood.Specially the scene where Morgan freeman said that if he want to break\u000ain this small tool it would take around years to break.And the words The first night's the toughest, no doubt about it. They\u000amarch you in naked as the day you were born, skin burning and half\u000ablind from that delousing they throw on you, and when they put you in\u000athat cell... and those bars slam home... that's when you know it's for\u000areal.

V\u000a"The Shawshank Redemption" is a movie about time, patience and loyalty\u000a-- not sexy qualities, perhaps, but they grow on you during the\u000asubterranean progress of this story, which is about how two men serving\u000alife sentences in prison become friends and find a way to fight off\u000adespair.The story is narrated by "Red" Redding (Morgan Freeman), who has been\u000ainside the walls of Shawshank Prison for a very long time and is its\u000aleading entrepreneur. He can get you whatever you need: cigarettes,\u000acandy, even a little rock pick like an amateur geologist might use. One\u000aday he and his fellow inmates watch the latest bus load of prisoners\u000aunload, and they make bets on who will cry during their first night in\u000aprison, and who will not. Red bets on a tall, lanky guy named Andy\u000aDufresne (Tim Robbins), who looks like a babe in the woods.\u000a

V\u000aWhy do I want to write the 234th comment on The Shawshank Redemption? I\u000aam not sure - almost everything that could be possibly said about it\u000ahas been said. But like so many other people who wrote comments, I was\u000aand am profoundly moved by this simple and eloquent depiction of hope\u000aand friendship and redemption. The only other movie I have ever seen that effects me as strongly is To\u000aKill a Mockingbird. Both movies leave me feeling cleaner for having\u000awatched them.I didn't intend to see this movie at all: I do not like prison movies\u000aand I don't normally watch them. I work at a branch library and one day\u000aas I was checking The Shawshank Redemption out to one of our older\u000apatrons, she said to me, "Whenever I feel down or depressed, I check\u000aout this movie and watch it and it always makes me feel better." At the\u000atime, I thought that was very strange. One day there was nothing on TV\u000aexcept things I absolutely would not watch under any circumstance or\u000athings that I had seen too many times already. I remembered what she\u000asaid, so I watched it. I have watched it many many times since then and\u000ait gets better with every showing.No action, no special effects - just men in prison uniforms talking to\u000aeach other.The Shawshank Redemption and To Kill a Mockingbird are the best movies\u000aI have ever seen. I do not judge it by it's technical merits - I don't\u000areally care about that. I have read that Citizen Kane or The Godfather\u000aor this or that movie is the best movie ever made. They may have the\u000abest technique or be the most influential motion pictures ever made,\u000abut not the best. The best movies are ones that touch the soul. It\u000atakes a movie like The Shawshank Redemption to touch the soul\u000a

I love the groundwork that goes\u000ainto the best executed escape ever - the 'this is how I did it' bit is\u000aso pleasing!! It's so satisfying to watch when everyone gets their just\u000adesserts!! I really like that the story is told through the eyes of\u000ared. I like the idea of institutionalization, and the struggle that\u000aprisoners face when they leave prison - Brooks story is so sad. I love\u000athe pure bliss of Tim Robbins when he does something good for his\u000ainmates. And I love the end, so perfect and happy and hopeful! Never\u000adisappoints :)\u000a

V\u000aThis move is remarkable every time I watch it. The cinematography,\u000amusic, character development and everything the movie captures only\u000ahappens so often. In the beginning you watch as Anthony's wife cheats\u000aon him and implies he's the murderer. When in court you have mixed\u000afeelings. Did he murder his wife and lover? all the evidence is there.\u000aThough how Anthony presented himself shows what kind of character he\u000ais. As he enters Shawshank, I personally got a sickening feeling of\u000awhat he was about to experience. Though excitement too. How was this\u000aman going to survive a prison. When Morgan Freeman's Character ( Red )\u000aenters the story, he speaks so much of routine and what the life.\u000aBreaking reality from fantasy when he says " There's no fairy tales in\u000aShawshank " implying everything you fear what would happened. Did\u000ahappen. Although, one of the most uplifting parts is with Anthony\u000abreaks free. He sends a letter to Red telling him " Hope is a good\u000athing. It's never wrong to hope. Good things don't die" This message\u000aspeaks so profoundly, after Brooks death and the dependency on\u000aShawshank. That message speak so profoundly. This movie is more than a 10/10. It captures everything it wants and\u000aneeds to then some. I highly recommend this movie to anyone and\u000aeveryone who enjoys a good film.\u000a

V\u000aIn 1946, a banker named Andy Dufresne (Tim Robbins) is convicted of a\u000adouble murder, even though he stubbornly proclaims his innocence. He's\u000asentenced to a life term at the Shawshank State Prison in Maine, where\u000aanother lifer, Ellis "Red" Redding (Morgan Freeman), picks him as the\u000anew recruit most likely to crack under the pressure. The ugly realities\u000aof prison life are quickly introduced to Andy: a corrupt warden (Bob\u000aGunton), sadistic guards led by Capt. Byron Hadley (Clancy Brown), and\u000ainmates who are little better than animals, willing to use rape or\u000abeatings to insure their dominance. But Andy does not crack: he has the\u000ahope of the truly innocent, which (together with his smarts) allow him\u000ato prevail behind bars. He uses his banking skills to win favor with\u000athe warden and the guards, doing the books for Norton's illegal\u000abusiness schemes and keeping an eye on the investments of most of the\u000aprison staff. In exchange, he is able to improve the prison library and\u000abring some dignity and respect back to many of the inmates, including\u000aRed. Based on a story by Stephen King, The Shawshank Redemption was the\u000adirectorial debut of screenwriter Frank Darabont. ~ Mark Deming, Rovi\u000a

V\u000aThe Shawshank Redemption is a good movie. It has a good story and good\u000aacting. Though I don 't think that the movie is good enough to be at\u000athe top of the 250 list at IMDb. I think that it is a great "prison\u000amovie" but it's so similar to other books and movies like Midnight\u000aExpress or The Escape From Alcatraz. A "prison movie" that is much\u000abetter but doesn't get the glory and credibility is The Green Mile\u000awitch made me more emotional and excited. Compared with The Shawshank\u000aRedemption, The Green mile has a better storyline and most important an\u000aoriginal prison story.The Shawshank Redemption is about man called Andy who is being wrongly\u000aaccused for a crime that he didn't do. He was given two life sentences\u000afor killing his wife and her lover in cold blood. Therefore he is being\u000asent to Shawshank Prison. Andy learns to adapt to prison life and he\u000ameets knew friends, but also enemies. The life in prison is hard and he\u000ameets a lot of obstacles as the story goes.As I said earlier, it is a good movie and you should see it if you\u000ahaven't. However in my opinion it is too unoriginal and safe for the\u000abest film in history as many other think. By saying safe I mean that\u000athe director could have done something that had made me remember the\u000afilm. Something out of the ordinary. Instead of the "escape prison"\u000aunoriginality. Cause now I think it's just a bland movie.Another thing that I think the movie misses is more fighting and crime.\u000aIsn't this a prison? Should it not have any sort of violent behavior?\u000aSure Andy fights of a bunch of enemies in a few short scenes, but I\u000adon't think that that's enough. The thing is that Andy's enemies are\u000athe only bad guys in the whole movie. At least of what we see in this\u000afilm. The film could have exploited more violence and crime, but\u000ainstead we get a nice old man that feeds his bird. Andy's friends are\u000aso nice that I sometimes feel like they are workmates instead of\u000acommitted criminals. When they are out in the yard all convicts are\u000ajust playing ball and talking like they are having a lunch brake. I\u000adon't mean that all prisoners should just fight and swear but it could\u000ahave least been one fight seen in the yard so you get a bit more of\u000athat prison feeling.In conclusion it's a good movie with some flaws. It's has many good\u000ascenes. Though in my opinion it fails because of its blandness and\u000aunoriginality. They should have put more effort in making something\u000amore memorable.Based on my judgment it's a 8/10 and I think that it's a fare rating.\u000aIt should have its title in the top 250, but not the number one.//Swedish Critic\u000a

The same goes\u000awith the other guy that looked like Keith from OTH but didn't look like\u000ahim when close. Great movie. I cannot believe that twist ending I think\u000athere was like 20-30 people crying out loud in the cinema and I think\u000aone of them was transferred to the hospital because he was chocked, oh\u000amy god this movie was fantastic, I cannot believe how great it was. I\u000ahave watched it 2 times and it was even better the second time because\u000athen you noticed small little tiny details that you did in fact not\u000anotice the first time you watched this masterpiece of a movie, I wish\u000aevery movie was like this because then I would watch everything and\u000athen just review it the same as this one. Never has there been such a\u000agood movie. 10/10 Great acting, great story, amazing everything.\u000a

V\u000aShawshank Redemption is quite possibly the best movie ever made. This\u000aincludes all time frames and genres. There are no flaws in this story;\u000aonly brilliance. It's simply a remarkable story. It's a timepiece\u000afeature with an amazing cast. Character development is top-notch. The\u000astory line and delivery are extraordinary. I wish I could re- watch\u000athis movie over again as if I had never seen it before, so do yourself\u000aa favor... if you're watching this movie or plan to watch this movie\u000afor the first time... turn off your phone, dim the lights and be\u000aprepared to be amazed. It's an enriching story with adult content that\u000ais suitable for older kids. You will laugh. You will cry. You will get\u000aangry. And... you will feel love, hope and redemption unlike any movie\u000ayou have ever seen before. Shawshank Redemption is unforgettable.\u000a

V\u000aThis has to be one of the best movies I have ever watched! No movie\u000areal or fictional will ever face up to this one! I had never seen this\u000amovie until about 3 or 4 months ago and I had also heard so much about\u000ait, having watched it I've listened and heard it everywhere only good\u000athings and people saying it is the best movie ever and I 100% agree it\u000ais the best movie ever. There are some brilliant and creative movies\u000aout there but this movie really appeals to all our senses and is\u000amagnificent. I don't know how the writers even came up with such a good\u000astoryline. Also well done to the actors who played such a good part in\u000athe movie and made it come to life on the big screen. One of my fave\u000aactors was in it which made it for me and that was Morgan Freeman! I\u000alove his voice and I truly admire his acting skills. As a director and\u000acameraman I admire the fantastic work of the cameramen and the\u000abrilliant directing. Well done to everyone involved in this movie, I\u000aimagine they are very proud of what they have created and indeed they\u000ashould be!\u000a

A life lesson that shows what can happen to oneself from\u000aone day to the other just to make a nonsense. Finally, Some 20 years\u000aturned into 2 hours, I recommend this movie to movie lovers.

V\u000aThis is my favorite movie of all time and there is a good reason for\u000ait. When i was still in my early teens i would only watch action movies\u000aand would disregard any drama movie, i could not understand why anyone\u000awould want to watch a movie like this. one day there were no action\u000amovies on TV and me being bored i was skipping franticly through the TV\u000aguide, i could not find anything worth my time, i thought. And then i\u000agot to a movie that got rated 5 stars! I could not believe this, i had\u000anever seen a movie in the TV guide get rated 5 stars not even the\u000aaction movies i enjoyed so much which surprised me at the time. So me\u000ascratching my face with boredom i decided to watch this movie because\u000aafter all there has to be something to this movie it being rated 5\u000astars and all. as the movie was going along it was so calming and\u000asmooth that today this day i cannot find the right words to describe\u000ait- it felt like it was never going to end but, i didn't wanted it to\u000aend it! it was incredible, this movie expanded my motion-picture\u000aviewing to whole new levels. Therefore it will always be my favorite\u000amovie.P.S Sorry for my English-writing, I'm dutch.\u000a

V\u000aBare with me, for this is my first written review, ever. Please don't\u000apersecute me because of it. I think this is one of the better stories\u000athat Stephen King has let into movie productions. Even though a lot of\u000ahis novels would make excellent movies, but yet I have not seen them on\u000athe screen. Actually, that may be a good thing for us readers. I have\u000aseen several novels that made it into the movies and relatively were\u000abad. Not saying that those were Stephen Kings' novels. The reason being\u000ais that because its hard sometimes to capture what is in a storybook\u000aand put it to life on the screen. In this case, I believe that they\u000apulled it off successfully. Anyway, this is a film that I can watch and\u000are-watch a million and one times and never become bored of it. I am a\u000aHUGE fan of Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman, these two were made\u000aperfectly for the roles that they played. It would be nice to see them\u000ain future roles, in the same movie sometime soon.\u000a

Every\u000aelement comes together to form an exquisite story for cinema. I believe\u000athat one reason that this movie is under-appreciated is that people\u000ahave not seen it multiple times. On first viewing it is the story of\u000aAndy Dufresne and his struggle to maintain hope despite his\u000acircumstances. However, this is really a movie about Red and his\u000astruggle to find meaning and purpose. The final segment of the movie\u000atestifies to the fact that the final resolution of the story comes\u000aabout only when Red is faced with the same fearful situation as Brooks.\u000aBecause of Andy, Red can find a different path-the path of freedom that\u000ais lit by hope.

V\u000aThe Shawshank Redemption is one of the best films I ever watched. I\u000anormally do not like watching films about prisons. However, This film\u000achanged my opinion. It was boring and a usual prison based movie at the\u000avery beginning. It keeps you watching as you watching. I would\u000arecommend to keep watching the whole movie in order to understand\u000afully.I would in fact recommend you to watch for several times. As you watch\u000aagain you see different things.It has a great storyline. The pace of the film changes. Cast are nicely\u000achosen. And actors act very well. It has an adventurous story. Although\u000amost of the film is about prison life, it surprises the audience by\u000afreedom at the end.Costumes were chosen nicely as well. I felt time travelling through\u000awatching the film. I do not know if I needed to comment on this too.\u000aHowever, when ever I watch a film I watch in detail.Performance, costume, location, reality, story, picture and sound\u000aquality are very important for me. I can tell you I have seen good\u000aquality in most of the above mentioned aspects.\u000a

V\u000aFrank Darabont directed this superb adaptation of the Stephen King\u000anovella that stars Tim Robbins as Andy Dufresne, a young banker who was\u000awrongfully convicted for the murders of his wife and her boyfriend.\u000aUpon arrival at Shawshank prison in Maine, he keeps to himself mostly,\u000acausing no trouble, though does befriend long-time inmate "Red'\u000aRedding(played by Morgan Freeman) who teaches him the ropes of prison\u000alife, though the unwanted attentions of degenerate inmates pushes poor\u000aAndy to the edge of despair, until his financial skills as a banker\u000aprove most useful to both the corrupt Captain of the guards(played by\u000aClancy Brown) and corrupt warden(played by Bob Gunton) until Andy hits\u000aupon a most clever escape plan... Now legendary film that sits atop the\u000aIMDb best film list is indeed a worthy film(though not my pick!) Still,\u000adone with remarkable skill on every filmmaking level. Could be viewed\u000aas an allegory of Christianity, but is indeed an uplifting story of\u000afriendship and the human spirit. Supporting characters(except for the\u000aone played by James Whitmore) aren't that appealing, but aren't\u000aintended to be either! Perfect ending as well.\u000a

The story begins with the trial of a young banker,\u000aAndy Dufrense, victimized by circumstantial evidence, resulting in a\u000aconviction for the murder of his wife and her lover. After a quick\u000aconviction, Andy finds himself serving a life sentence at Shawshank\u000aprison, with no hope of parole. He exists in this prison only in\u000aappearance, keeping his mind free from the drab walls around him. His\u000aability to do this results in the gaining of respect from his fellow\u000ainmates, but most of all from Ellis Redding. Ellis, commonly referred\u000ato as Red, finds gainful use of his entrepreneurial spirit within the\u000adrab walls of Shawshank by dealing in contraband and commodities rare\u000ato the confines of prison. Andy's demeanor and undeniable sense of hope\u000acauses Red to take a deeper look at himself, and the world around him.\u000aAndy proves to Red and the other inmates that in the conventional walls\u000aof Shawshank prison convention will find no home in his lifestyle.\u000a

V\u000aThe Shawshank Redemption is without a doubt one of the most brilliant\u000amovies I have ever seen. Similar to The Green Mile in many respects\u000a(and better than it in almost all of them), these two movies have shown\u000aus that Stephen King is a master not only of horror but also of prose\u000athat shakes the soul and moves the heart. The plot is average, but King\u000adid great things with it in his novella that are only furthered by the\u000adirection, and the acting is so top-rate it's almost scary.Tim Robbins plays Andy Dufrane, wrongly imprisoned for 20 years for the\u000amurder of his wife. The story focuses on Andy's relationship with "Red"\u000aRedding (Morgan Freeman, in probably his best role) and his attempts to\u000aescape from Shawshank. Bob Gunton is positively evil and frightening as\u000aWarden Norton, and there are great performances and cameos all around;\u000athe most prominent one being Gil Bellows (late as Billy of Ally McBeal)\u000aas Tommy, a fellow inmate of Andy's who suffers under the iron will of\u000aNorton.If you haven't seen this movie, GO AND RENT IT NOW. You will not be\u000adisappointed. It is positively the best movie of the '90's, and one of\u000amy Top 3 of all time. This movie is a spectacle to move the mind, soul,\u000aand heart. 10/10\u000a

V\u000aRobbins and Freeman have the juice as actors to make figuring out\u000awhether Andy and Red really did it a riveting guessing game, especially\u000aif you're a sucker for prison melodramas. Writer Frank Darabont (The\u000aFly II), in his feature-directing debut, doesn't skimp on the\u000acaged-bird clichés, sadistic and sentimental, but he plays enough\u000ahardball with the formula to evoke memories of such goodies as Cool\u000aHand Luke, Birdman of Alcatraz and Riot in Cell Block II.Stephen King wrote the novella Rita Hayworth and the Shawshank\u000aRedemption, on which the film is based. (Andy's cell is bedecked with a\u000aposter of Hayworth in all her Gilda glory.) You can find the novella in\u000aa 1982 King collection, Different Seasons, along with a story, "The\u000aBody," that became the, basis for the 1986 Rob Reiner smash Stand by\u000a

V\u000aI decided to make a review about a fantastic film, which I personally\u000athink it should deserve a lot better, it was forced to be re-released\u000ato reach more than the budget. The Shawshank redemption a movie\u000adirected by Frank Darabont The Shawshank Redemption is an American\u000adrama film made by writer Stephen King from the beginning, with Tim\u000aRobbins and Morgan Freeman in the lead roles. The film is about the\u000asuccessful banker Andy ( Tim Robbins ) who is wrongly convicted for\u000amurder of his wife and her lover. He is sent to Shawshank Prison for\u000alife. This is one of the toughest prisons in the United States during\u000athe 1940s. There he meets Red ( Morgan Freeman ) as they quickly\u000abecomes very good friends. Years after years Andy just gets more and\u000amore famous among the guards, and the prisoners, and it ends with Andy\u000ahelps a guard to get $ 25,000 as a gift. Then the police- officer\u000aNorton realizes that Andy might be useful, so he started taking care of\u000athe prison economy. It causes him to get control of what happens in the\u000aprison and it gives him great opportunities to escape from the prison.\u000aThe film has a strong and important purpose that you should never give\u000aup and always have hopes for what will happen. That trust is a big\u000aimpact on relationships, The film can be viewed by anyone of any age\u000aand it is a very good and interesting movie. It defiantly deserves\u000abetter because it is a touching movie and very inspiring.\u000a

V\u000aOne of my all time favorites. Shawshank Redemption is a very moving\u000astory about hope and the power of friendship. The cast is first rate\u000awith everyone giving a great performance. Tim Robbins and Morgan\u000aFreeman carry the movie, but Bob Gunton and Clancy Brown are perfect as\u000athe Warden Norton and prison guard captain Hadley respectively. And\u000aJames Whitmore's portrayal of an elderly inmate Brooks is moving. The\u000ascreenplay gives almost every actor at least one or more memorable\u000alines through out the film. As well as a very surprising "twist" near\u000athe end that almost knocked me out of my chair. If you have not seen\u000athis movie rent it or better yet buy it.

V\u000aExcellent inspirational movie to watch... extreme worth to spent time\u000aon this Forget about what others (including myself) might suggest\u000ayou'll discover in "The Shawshank Redemption;" when you watch it,\u000ayou'll identify something very personal in your own life with a scene,\u000aa character, or a moment in this uncomplicated movie. When you need\u000ahope, you'll look for Shawshank. When you want to believe in the will\u000aof overcoming even the greatest obstacles, Shawshank will uplift you in\u000aways that you can't find in movies today. Some liken the film to some kind of spiritual awakening. Of course,\u000asome can go to a church or mosque to find enlightenment and Faith in\u000ahumanity, but most places of worship are open only certain days or\u000atimes. But when you need affirmation of the lasting bond of friendships\u000athat prevail over the most dire circumstances, Shawshank will give it\u000ato you. It makes grown men (like me) cry, still. I wonder whether\u000aShawshank was truly meant for viewing in the privacy of the home,\u000abecause it is a personal experience that really makes you look inward.\u000aNominated for seven, this is the best film that never one a single\u000aOscar. How ironic that an innocent man winds up being surrounded by the\u000acorruption of the legal system. Shawshank itself is similar to the\u000acharacter of Andy Dufresne. Prejudging this classic film, critics\u000acouldn't get past the title. The public followed suit, initially\u000adismissing Shawshank, which failed in the box office just like "It's a\u000aWonderful Life" and "Citizen Kane." It could have just whithered away\u000aon the store shelves, like Andy Dufresne could have in his own cell.\u000aBut the characters prevailed, because Andy -- And Shawshank -- stayed\u000atrue. Now, these movies are right up there as the most popular films of\u000aall time. Anyone who has yet to watch Shawshank may be so jaded of movies, or the\u000afilm's title, or how a 2-1/2- hour movie set inside the walls of a\u000aprison can manage to tap the soul of such a wide range of people.\u000aShawshank has not one explosion. I wonder if it even has a single\u000aspecial effect or digitally- enhanced frame.\u000a

V\u000aThis movie is just awesomely brilliant. Okay, English teachers may not\u000alike that description, but simply put, this movie is one great movie.\u000aThis movie is about a prison in Maine named Shawshank. A wealthy\u000abanker, Andy Dufrense (Tim Robbins) is arrested, charged, and convicted\u000afor murdering his wife and her lover. He claims that he did not do it,\u000abut the evidence points directly to him. He claims that he is innocent,\u000abut so does everybody else in Shawshank. Andy, though, proclaims his\u000ainnocence right through to the end. He says "the only time I became\u000acrooked was when I came to Shawshank".The Shawshank Redemption is adapted from the Stephen King novel "Rita\u000aHeywood and the Shawshank Redemption", and as is typical for Stephen\u000aKing, the horror comes not from the supernatural but from the natural.\u000aThe horror here is of being thrown into prison an innocent man, and\u000athen never being able to leave because of the corruption all around.\u000aAndy is clearly innocent by the closing stages of the movie, but by\u000athat time he is such a key element to the Warden's plans, that there is\u000ano way he is ever going to be allowed to leave. Ebert speaks of the\u000ahorror of time and of daily routine here, but more so there is the\u000asense of alienation. Once one is inside the walls one can never really\u000aleave. When one prisoner, Brooks Halten (James Whitmore) is released,\u000ahe kills himself due to the fact that he is free. Red (Morgan Freeman)\u000asays when he is finally released, that without the strict routine of\u000athe prison system and with the freedom of daily life, he just cannot\u000acope.Andy is different, he has hope, and he retains this hope right through\u000auntil the end. We do not see the big picture until the end of the\u000amovie, when we are revealed all, but Andy remains calm, patient, and\u000aresolute, knowing that in the end he is going to be free. He is also an\u000aopportunist, he sees an opportunity and he takes it, and when he does,\u000ahe gains the friends that he needs to survive in the prison. He is not\u000aa pushover, for when the sisters seek to violate them, he fights, and\u000ahe fights brutally, but he knows that in the end he will be out and he\u000aputs up with it.This movie is about hope. It is not a fantasy: Red says "if this was a\u000afantasy then he would have fought them off and everything would have\u000abeen fine, but it is not." This is real and King has pulled no punches.\u000aYet also the hope is there; we see real characters with real\u000afallibilities. Even Andy falls occasionally and is blackmailed into\u000asubmission, but he has that hope and he always looks forward to\u000afreedom.\u000a

V\u000aShawshank is an example of the beauty and power that great cinema can\u000aconjure. A deceptive film of prison life that contains violence, humor,\u000aan extremely tear-jerking moment. A lot happens, yet the film just\u000aseems to amble confidently along like the film's main character. This\u000afilm works on so many levels and definitely rewards repeated viewing.\u000aThe cinematography and music are wonderful, as are the central\u000aperformances. Yet for all this it is the tale itself and how it is told\u000athat makes this (one of) the greatest stories ever told. People have\u000atheorized about what this film means ...is it an disguised story of\u000aJesus?...a simple tale of friendship?...a tale of corruption?...a\u000alecture on faith and 'holding on'?...or is the main character not who\u000awe think it to be for 3/4 of the film? After all there is one major\u000a'redemption' in this film: a man who has to decide whether "It's time\u000ato get busy dying, or get busy living". REDEEM YOURSELF, SEE THIS FILM.\u000a

V\u000aI made my mind to watch this movie in 2012 as most of users recommended\u000aon IMDb. I always wonder what could be one thing that makes Shawshank\u000alegend of Hollywood movies. Well, I gotta say I found my favorite actor\u000aof lifetime after watching it: Morgan Freeman. Every single thing in\u000athe movie is 10/10. Story of Stephen King, screenplay, dialogs, drama,\u000asuspense, crime and action. I compare Morgan to Amitabh Bachchan of\u000aHollywood. The brief voice of Freeman moves me whenever I heard him. I\u000anever gets tired watching it again and again, its that kind of out of\u000athis world picture. I still sit back in ave and can't help myself from\u000awatching it again and again. Thanks to strong direction and support\u000astaff, this makes to top my list all-time.\u000a

V\u000aI liked this film very much...until the end. I thought, "NO! Please\u000adon't give us a fairytale ending!" For me, the film should have ended\u000aafter Red found what Andy had left for him, or maybe showing him on his\u000away to be reunited with Andy. The scene on the beach was out of\u000acharacter with the rest of the film, even though Andy had talked about\u000ait earlier. And HE IS WORKING ON SOME PIECE OF SH*T BOAT IN THE MIDDLE\u000aOF NOWHERE?! HOW did it get there? I thought, "WHY such an ending to\u000awhat up to now had been a great film? So I was very relieved when I\u000adiscovered that Frank Darabont wanted a different ending, and it was\u000athe studio wanted it that way (how many times has THAT happened in the\u000ahistory of Hollywood -- f*cking up a good thing).\u000a

V\u000aI think this film is very impressing because you can see into the life\u000aof a prisoner who don't made a crime. In one scene for example the\u000ajudge who talk about Andy Dufresne see in his face he is a person who\u000adon't have any feelings but the judge don't now that Andy was a quiet\u000aperson who act like a kind of introvert. And when he came to the\u000aShawshank he gives all the others the impression he is the first victim\u000aof the other prisoners but he always take his head up, and because of\u000ahis experience he uses his knowledge to make his and the life of the\u000afriends he meet in the prison a little better. In the end you can see\u000athat the actor Tim Robbins mystify all the people who thought they know\u000ahim, so he can break out and give the Shawshank chief and the employees\u000athe lesson which they don't forget for their life. In the End his best\u000aFriend Red and himself begin a new stage of life in Mexico.\u000a

V\u000aBest movie ever! Story line ...awesome! A man convicted of murder lives\u000ain a prison brutally ruled by a sadistic warden and secretly run by a\u000acon who knows all the ropes and pulls all the strings. The story is\u000anarrated by man named Red, who killed his wife to collect insurance.\u000aEveryone is probably thinking "what an awful man" and "I already don't\u000alike this guy" but throughout the story without knowing, you start to\u000aactually feel sorry for him and everyone else in the prison. I don't\u000aknow what it is that Stephen King does but you really start to feel\u000alike they all have done nothing wrong. When a man by the name of Andy\u000aDufrense comes to Shawshank on charges of killing his wife Linda\u000aDufrense and her lover Glenn Quentin, who was a golf pro he changes the\u000aprison and he becomes a man nobody will ever forget. Andy claims to be\u000anot guilty, and throughout the story he tries to prove that. He usually\u000akeeps to himself and he has this attitude about him that doesn't seem\u000aright for a prisoner at Shawshank prison. He walks around calmly and\u000aupright just as if he was talking a walk through the park, this doesn't\u000aland Andy many friends. While doing his time in Shawshank he is\u000aconstantly fighting a battle with these men people call the sisters and\u000ahis freedom. This book is a very adventurous and somewhat mysterious\u000abook, it's probably not suitable for younger readers just because of\u000athe language and some sexual content, but I would definitely recommend\u000ait to young adults.\u000a

V\u000aPeople can hear about this movie and think that it's just a movie about\u000aprison life (which is interesting on its own) but the themes are much\u000adeeper in The Shawshank Redemption as if taking an idea that you\u000athought could not be more deeply insightful and somehow making\u000ait...more insightful. And it just works in this movie's favor. There is\u000aa reason why this movie is #1 (as of Thanksgiving Day 2013) and the\u000areason why is because that we have all be stuck in that place in life\u000afeeling trapped from the outside world but you eventually make the best\u000aof it with the friends that you make a long the way and even keep in\u000atouch with them as shown in one of the happiest and greatest endings in\u000acinema. So this Thanksgiving (or any day of the year) tell all of your\u000afamily and friends to watch this movie because on any holiday the\u000athemes of this movie can connect to each and every person's life.Verdict10/10\u000a

V\u000aThe Shawshank Redemption is another Stephen King book based movie made\u000amy Frank Darabont. I have said earlier that when Darabont makes a movie\u000abased on a Stephen King book, it simply results in magic on screen, and\u000aThe Shawshank Redemption is almost a perfect example of that. Despite\u000areceiving very positive reviews from critics, developing a cult\u000afollowing, this film failed to well at the Box Office and barely\u000amanaged to recover it's costs.It's a shame really because this film deserves better, it is one of the\u000abest films of the 90s and an excellent film, with a very deep and\u000aengaging plot. Shawshank Redemption is a movie based on Prison Life and\u000afollows the life of two prisoners who become close friends. Darabont\u000aalso made another movie based on Prison Life, The Green Mile, also\u000abased on a Stephen King book. However the former is a more realistic\u000aportrayal of prison life, it shows the harsh life of prisons even back\u000ain the 1940s-60s and the hostile environment, prison life is portrayed\u000amore accurately.The Plot is simply fantastic, after first 5 minutes I was just hooked,\u000aand the plot is the main reason I kept on re-watching this movie,\u000ahowever I did find myself struggling on the 4th viewing because the\u000amovie really starts to drag a lot at several points, and if you have\u000awatched those slow progressing scenes before they will be hard to sit\u000athrough again. The movie does not try to completely serious at times,\u000ait also has it's amusing moments and some nice heart warming moments,\u000athe ending was also well done, although a dialogue exchange between Red\u000aand Dufaine would have been nice.However the plot is not really perfect, there are several unexplained\u000athings in the movie, how did Andy manage to frame the Warden or Hadley\u000afor Tommy's murder, and wouldn't revealing the Warden's illegal\u000aearnings also get Andy (who pretends to be Randall Stephens)in trouble.\u000aAlso the supposed twist, that Andy didn't do it seemed unnecessary\u000abecause it went nowhere, if Andy had in fact committed the murder and\u000agot his redemption, it would have added to the plot in my personal\u000aopinion. I am not going to criticize King's idea or the writers' ideas\u000abehind the story but I felt like the twist of of psychotic murderer was\u000aunnecessary. Also the films progresses years really fast, at least\u000ashowing you the year on a blank screen would have cleared the confusion\u000abecause even in my 4th viewing I was confused at several points, that\u000awhich year it actually was, Freeman's narrating was helpful but it\u000astill lead to confusion about which year it actually is.The acting is also good, Morgan Freeman steals the show with his\u000aperformance Red "Ellis Redding", he also narrates many parts of the\u000afilm and does it excellently. Bob Gunton and Clancy Brown act so well\u000aand really make you despise them. Even Adam Sandler plays the cool laid\u000aback prisoner very well. However Tim Robbin's is decent at best as Andy\u000aDufaine, it is understandable he was a depressed character but his\u000asmirk, blank and confused facial expressions throughout the film are\u000ajust tiresome, he really seems robotic, there are actors who could have\u000adone better honestly, nothing against Robbins, he can act well no\u000adoubt, he did good in Jacob's Ladder but here he doesn't stand out, not\u000asaying he is bad at all but his performance could have been better, as\u000ahe was the lead it would have added more to the film. The music is nice it fits the movie and many scenes very well. And the\u000adirection is also done very well, the portrayal of prison life is very\u000aaccurate and realistic. The film's message about hope and friendship is\u000aalso mesmerizing.The Shawshank Redemption is an underrated gem, an excellent film with\u000aan in-depth that deserved much more acclaim and commercial success at\u000aits time of release. However it is not perfect, has it's share of\u000amistakes and is simply not the greatest movie ever made as IMDb top 250\u000alists it.Overall: 9/10\u000a

Frank Darabont\u000adidn't need to put any kind of outlandish special effects to get us to\u000alove this film, the narration and the acting does that for him. Why\u000athis movie didn't win all seven Oscars is beyond me, but don't let that\u000asway you to not see this film, let its ranking on the IMDb's top 250\u000alist sway you, let your friends recommendation about the movie sway\u000ayou.Set aside a little over two hours tonight and rent this movie.

V\u000aBefore we can critically assess The Shawshank Redemption, we first have\u000ato deal with The Shawshank Reputation. In addition to its Oscar\u000anominations and huge critical acclaim, the film has topped the IMDb Top\u000a250 for years and shows no signs of dropping off any time soon. Any\u000aattempt to criticize it could come across as churlish or contrarily,\u000athe work of someone attempting to be above what is popular for their\u000aown self-righteous sake. Fortunately, there is little need to criticize\u000a- for Shawshank really is as great as people make it out to be.It's easy to forget how much of a slow-burning success Shawshank was.\u000aDespite favorable reviews and its many nominations, the film barely\u000abroke even on first release. It was only with the VHS release that word\u000abegan to spread like wildfire, so that by the turn of the century it\u000ahad garnered a reputation as a modern American great. In an age where\u000afilms are dead in the water if they don't perform on opening weekend,\u000ait is hard to imagine a situation in which another Shawshank could\u000aemerge (although Slumdog Millionaire is a reasonable candidate)\u000a

V\u000aTim Robbins and Morgan Freeman find themselves involved in a subtle\u000agame of power, changes of life and change of perception of the things.\u000aThe movie brings you into a small work of a prison and make it bigger,\u000ainvolving power, sentiments and freewill. The perfect story of how life\u000achanges again and again, no matter where you are,who you are and why\u000ayou are like that. You can always take control of your life again,\u000ausing even the anger to your own sake. In this perception the the\u000adownfall and the redemption from hell are part of a longer life process\u000athat anyone can experience whenever. The redemption of your soul can\u000atake many years but if you never stop believing it that will happen. A\u000amasterpiece anyone should see, even though is not your favorite gender\u000aof movie.\u000a

V\u000aThis film, if it isn't one of the greatest of all time, at least I can\u000asay it is one of the greatest I've ever seen. This is a must-recommend,\u000abecause to be honest, this is one of the many movies a movie lover must\u000asee before they die. It is not just a great film, but a great\u000aexperience. And it is quite the experience! Morgan Freeman gives the\u000aperformance of his career in this film. I give props to the director\u000afor making him narrate the film as well. He is just that great. Tim\u000aRobbins give a very underrated performance in this film. Freeman stole\u000athe show, but there was a certain subtlety of Robbins' that can't go\u000awithout being recognized. Either way, both these men give their full\u000aeffort into this film. There is a great atmosphere around this film as\u000awell, it's a subtle tone, as this is a subtle, (But great) film, but it\u000achanges when it needs to change, and it knows exactly when. As a\u000amatter-of-fact, what makes this movie great is that it knows exactly\u000awhen it needs to do something powerful, thoughtful or sentimental, and\u000ato be honest as a moviegoer, that is all I can ask for.\u000a

V\u000aAn amazing movie. Easily one of the best movies made during the 90s and\u000adefinitely one of the top 'prison' movies of all-time. Pretty much\u000aeverything about this movie works and works extremely well! It's a\u000asimple story elegantly, cleverly told, not to mention expertly acted.\u000aFreeman, who is simply a great actor, a man who has never struck a\u000afalse note in his career, both narrates this tale and anchors it with\u000ahis authoritative playing. The Shawshank Redemption works not only as\u000aan excellent prison drama, but as a metaphor for overcoming our own\u000aprivate prisons. Powerful, poignant, thought-provoking and finally\u000airresistibly uplifting.\u000a

V\u000aI saw "The Shawshank Redemption" quite a few times since it came out in\u000a1994 and I still sit there like it's the first time I watched it. This\u000ais 2013 and I am still passing this movie on to friends and family who\u000aunfortunately have never seen it before.Tim Robbins was superb in this this flick and IMO goes unmatched in any\u000aof his future movies that he has starred in.Great overall picture!I especially love how, over a long period of time, two total opposite\u000acharacters bond and become close friends!This is the first time I had seen Morgan Freeman in a film I believe,\u000aand I have probably watch 20 of his movies since. Amazing actor!!\u000a

From the reality of the plot to\u000athe roller-coaster of emotions for both the young and naive, and the\u000aold and wise alike. The Shawshank Redemption covers full circle real\u000alife occurrences from murder, infidelity, greed and corruption to\u000alaughter, clicks, bonds, loyalty and lastly, isolation. All this\u000aperfectly narrated by Morgan Freeman taking the viewer along the POV\u000apath of his characters mind, other characters highs and lows with o/s\u000alines detailed to the T of believing you yourself are experiencing it.\u000aMy hats off to the entire cast, crew and everyone involved in this\u000aproject.

"hope is a good\u000athing and No good thing ever dies" prisoners have an odd feeling mostly\u000afeel guilty for the things that busted them in, some may not. In here,\u000awe see a different approach to free a man himself with a powerful\u000aweapon 'hope'. so this hope gets him out that no one would ever try to\u000aimplement it.\u000a

Tim Robbins\u000ashows the limits to which a person can suffer and how he can bounce\u000aback with his brilliance and hope. Morgan Freeman gives a classy act\u000aand is very fit for the character. The direction is excellent and does\u000ajustice to the amazing script. The other actors have also portrayed\u000atheir characters brilliantly.

I work at a\u000abranch library and one day as I was checking The Shawshank Redemption\u000aout to one of our older patrons, she said to me, "Whenever I feel down\u000aor depressed, I check out this movie and watch it and it always makes\u000ame feel better." At the time, I thought that was very strange. One day\u000athere was nothing on TV except things I absolutely would not watch\u000aunder any circumstance or things that I had seen too many times\u000aalready. I remembered what she said, so I watched it. I have watched it\u000amany many times since then and it gets better with every showing. The\u000astory begins with the trial of a young banker, Andy Dufrense,\u000avictimized by circumstantial evidence, resulting in a conviction for\u000athe murder of his wife and her lover.\u000a

During his time at the\u000aprison, he befriends a fellow inmate, Ellis Boyd "Red" Redding, and\u000afinds himself protected by the guards after the warden begins using him\u000ain his money laundering operation. One of the greats motion picture I\u000ahave ever seen. There are 0 flaws to this film. And I counted.

There is a saying about great\u000amovies, that great movies just made themselves and that's about it, you\u000acant just make them again and again and among several of those great\u000amovies this movies will always stands.

V\u000a"The Shawshank Redemption" has a hype so high that it is unfair to the\u000afilm and its potential viewers. But it is an expertly written ocean of\u000awhat a movie should be, and how a movie should capture such emotions\u000afrom the audience, and how an audience will realize it is not\u000aglorified, but a masterpiece that is sure followed by almost any\u000afilmmaker by the slightest of touches. In this single film, it contains\u000aall of the basics (humor, drama, dread and redemption), but it tacks on\u000amuch more. From the depths of its characters to Andy's shoes. It is\u000aabout freedom, friendship and those metaphorical shackles. It's final\u000ascene could have not been so touching in a lesser movie, but it all\u000apans out. Pans out in ways we hoped. In ways we dreamed.\u000a

Our knowledge of Andy's innocence is\u000apainful to watch as he spends most of his life in prison, but I loved\u000athe ending, and I believe that a film with a good ending always makes\u000ait better because you leave the film on a good note. I thought that\u000aMorgan Freedman and Tim Robbins made the film what it was because as\u000aactors they were given the building blocks to bringing the character to\u000alife, and I thought they did it brilliantly.

V\u000aWhat more can you ask for? A spectacular cast, a gripping score and a\u000astrong plot all contribute this film's massive success. Easily Frank\u000aDarabont's greatest achievement, The Shawshank Redemption creates so\u000amuch atmosphere, and forces you to feel a whole spectrum of emotions\u000anot explored in most films. Although sometimes exaggerated (as to be\u000aexpected from a Stephen King source), the film deals without a lot of\u000aserious themes from the outset. The eventual revelation of Andy's\u000awrongful conviction is a great turning point in the story, and gives us\u000aeven more of a reason to root for our protagonist. Overall, the\u000adirection and acting are masterful, with such power put into Thomas\u000aNewman's score to send shivers through your body, there's not much else\u000ato expect from this movie: A triumph!\u000a

V\u000aWow! The general reaction to this movie. Frank Darabont brought Steven\u000aKing's Short story to a whole new light. The cast as well as the\u000ageneral look of this film that makes is the classic that it is. Andy\u000aDufrain (Tim Robbins) is accused and convicted of murdering his fiancé\u000aand her lover. Andy, the big city banker that was out of place\u000aimmediately strikes a cord in Red (Morgan Freeman). The two form a\u000arelationship after a bet that didn't cash out for Red. The tale of Andy\u000aand his terrible beginnings at the Shawshank Prison is unsettling. Tim\u000aRobbin's look and performance is superb! His soft,smart demeanor is\u000apainted well. His relationship with Red is the meat of the film. Andy's\u000adefiant yet peaceful persona slowly mends in with the rest of the\u000aprisoners. The story couldn't have been told better. Morgan Freeman is\u000athe actor we know now because of this role. His dedication to his\u000afriend is undying. The thought of relationships like that make this\u000amovie so watchable. The fact that you can watch this over and over and\u000anot be distracted is it's own note. Most who collect movies have this\u000atitle as a part of their collection. The story will be timeless because\u000aof the movie and cement Stephen King as not only a great Novelist but,\u000aamazing screenwriter. Everyone should watch this movie. The different\u000afeelings it invokes as well as the mystery that comes with the story\u000aare worth the Hour plus you spend. The problem is that the blueprints\u000afor movies like this aren't able to be written. That's why classics\u000alike this are far and few. Cinephiles would agree that the "Shawshank\u000aRedemption" is placed well at #1 on IMDb'S List.\u000a

V\u000aThis movie will surely touch your heart. Watched this film on a DVD.\u000aOnce the movie gets started, you cannot take yourself away from it.Can Hollywood, usually creating things for entertainment purposes only,\u000acreate art? To create something of this nature, a director must\u000aapproach it in a most meticulous manner, due to the delicacy of the\u000aprocess. Such a daunting task requires an extremely capable artist with\u000aan undeniable managerial capacity and an acutely developed awareness of\u000aeach element of art in their films, the most prominent; music, visuals,\u000ascript, and acting. These elements, each equally important, must\u000asucceed independently, yet still form a harmonious union, because this\u000amixture determines the fate of the artist's opus. Though already well\u000aknown amongst his colleagues for his notable skills at writing and\u000adirecting, Frank Darabont emerges with his feature film directorial\u000adebut, The Shawshank Redemption. Proving himself already a master of\u000athe craft, Darabont managed to create one of the most recognizable\u000aindependent releases in the history of Hollywood. The Shawshank\u000aRedemption defines a genre, defies the odds, compels the emotions, and\u000abrings an era of artistically influential films back to Hollywood.\u000a

V\u000aThere are few movies ever made that require no justification as to why\u000asome (or in this case almost everyone) considers it a classic,\u000aShawshank Redemption is one of those films.Shawshank lives onto this day in such high esteem that it feels almost\u000apitiless to do a "normal" review of the film for by now almost everyone\u000aout there has seen or knows of the movie that inspired us to "Get busy\u000aliving, or get busy dying" a movie that after watching it makes you\u000afeel like you could achieve anything or escape any prison either\u000aphysically or metaphorically.Upon re-watching the movie for the umpteenth time it occurred to me\u000athat there are so many reasons as to why Shawshank is the film it is, a\u000afilm that has so many elements that are truly classic. Here are some of\u000athe points in the film that to me make this movie endlessly rewarding\u000aand virtually as flawless as a movie could ever aim to be.- Shawshank Prison: is there anything more foreboding than the flying\u000acamera zooming over the prison grounds as a bus of "fresh fish"\u000aarrives? Shawshank acts as a character in itself both endlessly scary\u000ayet sadly home to many convicted men.- Morgan Freeman as Red: introducing the world to the now overused but\u000anever better voice over work of Freeman, Shawshank offered Freeman the\u000arole of his career as wise and deep thinking Red, a character everyone\u000afeels an affection towards.- Thomas Newman's score: crafting a score that ranges from the haunting\u000ato the uplifting, Newman's score for Shawshank is a work of a true\u000amusically genius and has cues that to this day are used in all manners\u000aof film and other advertising. Try not to feel emotion as the music\u000akicks in as Brook's leaves prison.- The Script: turning Stephen Kings short story into an epic 2 hour\u000aplus feature film may have to some seemed like a pipe dream but what\u000aDarabont did with the script is nothing short of a magnificent work by\u000aa wordsmith that will never top what he did here. Classic examples\u000ainclude: "Bad luck, I guess. It floats around. It's got to land on\u000asomebody. It was my turn, that's all. I was in the path of the tornado.\u000aI just didn't expect the storm would last as long as it has" or "The\u000afirst night's the toughest, no doubt about it. They march you in naked\u000aas the day you were born, skin burning and half blind from that\u000adelousing s**t they throw on you, and when they put you in that cell\u000aand those bars slam home that's when you know it's for real. A whole\u000alife blown away in the blink of an eye. Nothing left but all the time\u000ain the world to think about it".- The story: The journey Tim Robbins's Andy takes over 20 years in\u000aShawshank is one we the viewer's feel like we take to. Never more so\u000ahave we felt the sweat of prison workshops like we do here, the feeling\u000aof relief in times of outdoor recess or the fear of guards lying in\u000await to throw us in the "hole" or react with their batons. Shawshank is\u000amore than a prison movie however it is a life affirming tale of hope,\u000aloss and friendship.The Shawshank Redemption will continue to live on and be a part of best\u000aof lists, a future it deserves. Upon reflection and re-watch I can say\u000aone thing for certain and use a word that did not exist when Shawshank\u000afirst entered our world. Shawshank redemption is the best "bro-mance"\u000atale we will ever see, a tale that we will never forget and a movie\u000athat will never grow tired or old.5 Rita Hayworth posters out of 5 For more movie reviews and opinions\u000acheck out - www.jordanandeddie.wordpress.com\u000a

V\u000aI am not finding anything to deduct a point from 10/10 on watching this\u000amovie. Story line, screen play, acting, sequence, climax - SUPERB. Any\u000akind of viewer would like this, but keep patience till the end.\u000aSometime you might feel bored. My suggestion, keep watching with full\u000aof attention. At the end - A smile with satisfaction. You have watched\u000aa great movie in your life time. The dark room, typical jail stories\u000aetc are the real thrillers. I wonder, about the title. It is thin line\u000abetween the movie and title. Must watch this movie. If you like pursuit\u000aof happiness, this one you would love it. No actor will be given the\u000awhole credit for the movie. All are par to their responsibilities. Not\u000aa single character can be ignored. And finally the sequence. The whole\u000acredit goes to the director. Intelligent way of story telling. You must\u000akeep attention to every incident in this movie. You may miss out\u000asomething. Then don't blame me that I was wrong.\u000a

V\u000aThis movie is number #1 in IMDb and many of my friends says this movie\u000ais a crystal clear 10/10 and the best movie ever made. I don't think I can agree on that note. Maby I had too high\u000aexpectations or something but this one is really slow and have few\u000asequences that gives you this feeling of a really REALLY great movie.The actors of this movie I must say is very good and especially Morgan\u000aFreeman, whitch is one of my favorite actors of all time. He does a\u000agreat job. I give this movie 8/10 because it is a good movie, but nothing more\u000athan that.\u000a

V\u000aClassic review by R.E.This is a film that is deeper than most films; about continuity in a\u000alifetime, based on friendship and hope.Interesting that although the hero of the film is the convicted former\u000abanker Andy Dufresne (Tim Robbins), the action is never seen from his\u000apoint of view. The film's opening scene shows him being given two life\u000asentences for the murder of his wife and her lover, and then we move,\u000apermanently, to a point of view representing the prison population and\u000aparticularly the lifer Ellis 'Red' Redding (Morgan Freeman).From Andy's arrival on the prison bus to the film's end, we see only\u000ahow others see him - Red, who becomes his best friend, Brooks the old\u000alibrarian, the corrupt Warden Norton, guards and prisoners. Red is our\u000asurrogate. He's the one we identify with, and the redemption, when it\u000acomes, is Red's. We've been shown by Andy's example that you have to\u000akeep true to yourself, not lose hope, bide your time, set a quiet\u000aexample and look for your chance. "I guess it comes down to a simple\u000achoice, really," he tells Red. "Get busy livin' or get busy dyin'." The\u000akey to the film's structure, I think, is that it's not about its hero,\u000abut about our relationship with him - our curiosity, our pity, our\u000aadmiration. If Andy had been the heroic center, bravely enduring, the\u000afilm would have been conventional, and less mysterious. But we wonder\u000aabout this guy. Did he really kill those two people? Why does he keep\u000aso much to himself? Why can he amble through the prison yard like a\u000afree man on a stroll? People like excitement at the movies, and other\u000atitles provide that. But there's a hunger for messages of hope, and\u000awhen a film offers one, it's likely to have staying power even if it\u000adoesn't grab an immediate audience.The movie premiered at the Toronto Film Festival in September 1994, and\u000aopened a few weeks later. It got good reviews but did poor business\u000a($18 million B.O.; only another $10 million after 7 Oscar noms).There wasn't much going for it: It had a terrible title, it was a\u000a"prison drama", it contained almost no action, starred actors who were\u000anot big stars, and it was long at 142 minutes. This was a movie that\u000aneeded word-of-mouth to find an audience.Then, in one of the most remarkable stories in home video history, it\u000afound its real mass audience on tapes & TV. In five years, "Shawshank"\u000awas a phenomenon, a video best renter and seller. When the Wall Street\u000aJournal ran an article about Shawshank in 1999, it was first place in\u000athe IMDb vote of 250 best films.Polls and rentals reflect popularity but don't explain why people value\u000a"Shawshank" so fervently. It does have entertaining payoff moments (as\u000awhen Andy does all of the guards taxes). But much of the movie involves\u000aquiet, solitude, and philosophical discussions about life. The moments\u000aof violence are seen objectively, not exploited. The movie avoids\u000alingering on Andy's suffering.The Morgan Freeman character is carrier of the film's spiritual arc. We\u000asee him at three parole hearings, decades apart. The first hearing\u000ainvolves storytelling trickery; the film has opened with Andy's\u000asentencing, and as we see the parole board we expect to listen to\u000aAndy's appeal. But, no, that's when we first see Red. In his first\u000aappeal he tries to convince the board he's been rehabilitated. In the\u000asecond, he just goes through the motions. In the third, he rejects the\u000awhole notion of rehabilitation, and somehow in doing so he sets his\u000aspirit free and is released.There's an underlying problem. Behind bars, Red is king. He's the\u000aprison fixer, able to get you a pack of cigarettes, a little rock pick\u000aor a Rita Hayworth poster. On the outside, he has no status or\u000aidentity. We've already seen what happened to the old librarian (James\u000aWhitmore), lonely and adrift in freedom. The last act, in which Andy\u000ahelps Red accept his freedom, is deeply moving - all the more so\u000abecause Andy again operates at a distance, with letters and postcards,\u000aand is seen through Red's mind.Frank Darabont wrote and directed the film, basing it on a story by\u000aStephen King. His film grants itself a leisure that most films are\u000aafraid to risk. The movie is as deliberate, considered and thoughtful\u000aas Freeman's narration.Deliberate, too, is the dialogue. Tim Robbins makes Andy a man of few\u000awords, quietly spoken. He doesn't get real worked up. He is his own\u000aman, capable of keeping his head down for years and then indulging in a\u000agrand gesture, as when he plays an aria from Mozart's "The Marriage of\u000aFigaro." (The overhead shot of the prisoners in the yard, spellbound by\u000athe music, is one of the film's epiphanies.)Roger Deakins' cinematography is tactful, not showy. Two opening shots,\u000aone from a helicopter, one of prison walls looming overhead, establish\u000athe prison. Shots follow the dialogue instead of anticipating it.\u000aThomas Newman's music enhances rather than informs, and there is a\u000asubtle touch in the way deep bass rumblings during the early murder are\u000areprised when a young prisoner recalls another man's description of the\u000acrime.Darabont constructs the film to observe the story, not to punch it up\u000aor upstage it. "When they put you in that cell," Red says, "when those\u000abars slam home,that's when you know it's for real. Old life blown away\u000ain the blink of an eye. Nothing left but all the time in the world to\u000athink about it."Affection for good films often grows with familiarity, as it does with\u000amusic. Some have said life is a prison, we are Red, Andy is our\u000aredeemer. All good art is about something deeper than it admits.\u000a

V\u000aThe Shawshank Redemption which was released in 1994 is one of the\u000agreatest classic in the world's film industry. & it is also an\u000aexcellent work of Morgan Freeman. In this movie, the crude, naked and\u000atrue picture of an American jail has been revealed with a surprise.\u000aThrere is also an important message about intelligence of a man. This\u000amovie tells us that not a single man's intelligence is negligible.\u000aChicago Sun-Times film reviewer Roger Ebert suggested that The\u000aShawshank Redemption is an allegory for maintaining one's feeling of\u000aself-worth when placed in a hopeless position. Andy Dufresne's\u000aintegrity is an important theme in the story line, especially in\u000aprison, where integrity is lacking.Angus C. Larcombe suggests that the film provides a great illustration\u000aof how characters can be free, even in prison, or even in freedom,\u000abased on one's outlook on life.\u000a

V\u000aI watched it in 2013 and still was shocked after watching it's\u000aconclusion. Same thing happened with me earlier while watching 'The\u000aDark Knight Rises' !!Hope regenerated....Worth it...Rating - 9.1Some of the areas of the movie were slow poke for me but in the end i\u000acould conclude everything and link it up with the movie...Due to my late recognition i found it a bit lengthy though it was\u000aperfect when it was released. this movie is no doubt one of the best\u000acreation of the history which i don't think can be replaced by\u000aanything.Morgan freeman and his voice... best thing about the movie...\u000a

If\u000ayou are looking for great acting, family drama, awesome fighting scenes\u000athan this is the movie for you. After we left the theater we couldn't\u000astop talking about it. I will definitely go see it again when it comes\u000aout. We really enjoyed it! Nick Nolte was amazing, and even my husband\u000aI think cried in a few scenes, (last time that happened was during\u000aMarley and Me) so I must say this movie is a MUST SEE!\u000a

And that's hope.Morgan Freeman\u000aexuded his true potential in the 142 minutes of rolling reel. This\u000apiece of art needs to be admired at every glance just like a painting.\u000aThis is the Mona Lisa of cinematography. It makes you reconsider life.\u000aAgain. And Again.

V\u000aI do not know why I missed this film when it first premiered. Perhaps\u000ait was in the decade in which I lived under a rock. Nevertheless, I did\u000anot first see this film until 2007, and although I'd heard of it, I\u000awasn't sure what to expect. I knew it was a Stephen King adaptation\u000aand, honestly, I've never really been much of a King fan, although it\u000aseems that I keep watching many of the films adapted from his stories.\u000a(Seriously... The Langoliers? The butt worms. WTF?!) Still, I took to\u000aShawshank with little trepidation, allowing the story to unfold as it\u000awas meant, and I was hooked within minutes. Afterwards, I did what any\u000agood Shawshank fan should do, I watched it again. Robbins' and Freeman's performances were incredible. The story, well\u000atold, and the standard King-style twist, surprisingly unanticipated. Little to say,this movie immediately became my all-time favorite, and I\u000ahappily enjoy watching it whenever it comes available.\u000a

The type of connection the movie makes with the\u000aaudience is remarkable. It is not only critics favorite even with its\u000aintense story line it presents a slight humor which is astonishing.\u000aThis movie is ought to be best due to the marvelous direction different\u000ayet unique story and the characters the whole cast has done an\u000aastonishing job it indeed is a movie without errors of any sort. So Yes\u000athe movie does deserve the perfect 10 on 10.Some times a movie of such\u000ahigh note is way over peoples head though shawshank being a movie of\u000ahigh notes establishes a very well connection with each and every of\u000aits audience.This is what can be called as world class cinema.\u000a

V\u000athis is a good movie This film manages to redeem Hollywood in the eyes\u000aof people who feared it long lost in a dark sea of clichés and\u000apredictability. Darabont shows us that artists still work in the\u000aHollywood studios and production facilities. These artists show their\u000acapability to produce art; real art that inspires you to look at the\u000adeeper aspects of life and the world around you. The Shawshank\u000aRedemption delivers much-needed breath of fresh air for anyone who\u000arealizes the capability of film. It proves that masters of the craft\u000astill live on this earth, and still bless us with timeless masterpieces\u000athat we will never forget.\u000a

V\u000a"The Shawshank Redemption" is one of the best prison break i have ever\u000aseen. This is the story of freedom, the story of hope and friendship.\u000aThis movie is like a art because it is a combination of purely\u000aamalgamated of various emotions like friendships, hardships, hopes, and\u000adreams. simply it is a extraordinary creation by Frank Darabont and\u000apanned by Stephen King.If we talk about the cast of the movie then Freeman, who is simply a\u000agreat actor, both narrates this tale and anchors it with his\u000aauthoritative playing. Morgan Freeman has griped the narration aspects\u000aits why the has gained Oscar for best actor in leading role. On the\u000aother side Tim Robbins had played as Andy tremendously well but\u000asometimes he is unable to form bridge to audience. The story of Brooks\u000ais very emotional and heartbroken. At the time Brooks hung himself he\u000acarves in the wood "Brooks was here" in his apartment and then Red\u000aadded to it "And so was Red". The creation of this types of scenes will\u000asurely add a step further to won Oscar in best cinematography. I love\u000athat film because it had great impact on emotions and hopes. We can say\u000athat the Shawshank envelops friendships, hardships, hopes, and dreams.\u000aThe film contain very good quote that "Remember Red, hope is a good\u000athing, maybe the best of things, and no good thing ever dies." Andy\u000aDufresne. I want to express that if you don't love the Shawshank\u000aRedemption than you are beyond the bound of Redemption. After the\u000awatching this movie a question upswing in my mind that "why are these\u000amen in jail?" but after that i realize that everything matters that is\u000athe situation.So it is awesome movie and such type of movie should't be unseen. So\u000awatch this movie very precisely and i am sure that the movie will pour\u000ait's fraction of greatness in your life.\u000a

"Shawshank" slows down and looks.It uses the narrator's calm, observant voice to include us in the story\u000aof men who have formed a community behind bars.It is deeper than most films; about continuity in a lifetime, based on\u000afriendship and hope.over all it was an amazing movie.\u000a

This film has such a\u000agreat screenplay,full with great dialogue and amazing twists and turns\u000athat it is easily one of my top three films, ever! The main\u000aactors/characters, all turn in top performances, that one is swept\u000aalong with their relationships and the plot! Morgan Freeman is a truly\u000aoutstanding actor and in this film he excels in the role of 'Red', The\u000aold timer inmate, who befriends Tim Robbins, and build up a friendship\u000athe the film is centred on. When this film was first released it was\u000atotally under the radar and really didn't register as a 'Must See Film'\u000abut as the film was seen by more and more people, word of mouth, 'YOU\u000aHAVE TO SEE SHAWSHANK',made this film into the Super Cult classic film\u000ait has become, grossing many, Many times more in Video/DVDs sales than\u000ait ever did at the box office. in summary; Excellent and a must see, if\u000ayou haven't already seen this film..do it now!\u000a

V\u000aThe Shawshank Redemption by Frank Darabont is a classic film that tells\u000athe story of a man who overcomes the worst hardship and uses his wit to\u000adeceive his authorities. The audience follows a man named Andy Dufrense\u000athrough both the most terrible, and the most heartwarming events\u000aimaginable. As the film progresses, viewers develop a connection with\u000athe main characters as suspense builds with each succeeding event\u000a(Ebert). Camera angles are important in every movie from romance films\u000ato action films to comedies; however in a film that is as emotionally\u000aconnected as the Shawshank Redemption, camera angles are one of the\u000aprimary reasons this movie is so renowned. This original story by\u000aStephen King obviously laid a great foundation for Darabont's film;\u000ahowever the film uses different angles to enhance scene suspense\u000asomething that a book cannot do. Frank Darabont's use of specific\u000acamera angles throughout the film draws the audience closer to the\u000acharacters, creating an intimate relationship that makes The Shawshank\u000aRedemption one of the best movies of all time. Darabont's choice of camera angle develops a connection between Andy\u000aand the audience watching him, making for a much stronger overall film.\u000aThe first demonstration of brilliant camera angle is the court scene,\u000awhich shows up early in the film. The camera slowly zooms into his\u000aface, revealing his expression of complete shock and awe. This is\u000acritical because it gets the audience to realize the pain he is in at\u000athe moment. The next moment of noticeable camera work is when Andy is\u000alocked into his cell. The camera follows him through the hallway, and\u000athen enters the cell with him. The tiny detail to have the camera join\u000aAndy in the dark cell connects the audience in a way that literature\u000acannot. At this point, the audience feels the harsh entrapment that\u000aAndy feels. The next catastrophic scene in the movie is Andy's rape.\u000aThe camera does something here that works perfectly at making viewers\u000afeel horrible for the protagonist. It shows Andy alone in the laundry\u000aroom, yet uses the single light source to show only the dark side of\u000ahis body. As opposed to telling us that he is terribly depressed, the\u000acamera angle uses darkness to reveal how he feels. Towards the end of\u000athe movie, the camera uses one last movement that truly stands out.\u000aDarabont chose to both zoom out and tilt the camera down to give the\u000asensation of rising into the sky. Viewers feel the same sense of\u000afreedom that Andy feels that that moment. The view-points of these\u000aevents give the movie an upper hand to written version. Although the\u000acamera doesn't put these events in Andy's point of view, it still\u000amanages to make observers feel exactly what he is. Each of these\u000achoices in camera movement makes its own unique statement, yet they all\u000abond spectators to Andy by stimulating our intrigue, sorrow, or joy. Camera angle is frequently used to build suspense throughout the movie\u000awhich draws the audience in and holds them there. The first immensely\u000asuspenseful scene is when 'the sisters' rape Andy after beating him up.\u000aThe camera uses a dolly shot to fade away from the men, while\u000asimultaneously moving behind a corner so the audience cannot see all of\u000athe horrible events happening to Andy. The rest of the event is left up\u000ato imagination, which makes the spectators think about how Andy feels.\u000aThe camera movement itself is suspenseful in its nature. The next\u000asuspense-building scene is the book-shelving scene in the library that\u000aAndy took over. The camera shows Andy and Red's conversation from shelf\u000ato shelf, making them pause between each of their statements. At this\u000apoint, they were talking about Andy's cunning in taking over the\u000awarden's financial situation. Each time they move, the camera pans with\u000athem, forcing them to pause their conversation, which obviously leads\u000athe audience to anticipationwondering what will be said next. Another\u000agreat example is Red's journey out of the Shawshank Prison. The point\u000aof view switches over to Red, however the camera's talent of building\u000asuspense remains the same. Brooks left the prison before Red, and took\u000aa journey through town to a halfway house, where he hangs himself,\u000aleaving a note: 'Brooks was here.' Once Red is released, he follows\u000aBrooks' exact journey from location to location, and then etches into\u000athe walls next to Brooks' note 'so was Red.' The camera focuses on the\u000awriting on the wall so the audience cannot see whether or not Red hung\u000ahimself just like Brooks. After this, the director utilizes pedestal\u000amovement to slowly reveal the rest of the room, and it is discovered\u000athat Red did not hang himself, relieving the audience instantly. In\u000athis instance, the camera helped the movie build suspense where the\u000abook version would not be able to. After this scene, as the movie is\u000afinishing up, the audience is taken to the orchards with Red, in search\u000aof the note Andy left for him. This is one last moment of suspense\u000abecause of the camera angle. It tracks Red along the stone wall, but\u000anever shows us what he sees, leaving the viewer's asking 'will he find\u000athe special package or not?' Resolving the situation is in Red's hands,\u000aand the camera helps to build suspense until he finally sees the unique\u000arock. Often, words with a story can create enough suspense to draw a\u000agroup of people in; yet adding unique viewpoints will maximize the\u000aanticipation in most any movie.Though The Shawshank Redemption never earned any Oscars, it received\u000aseven nominations for multiple awards including best picture.This movie\u000ahas not received all of the popular accolades it deserves, yet that\u000adoesn't take away from its brilliance.\u000a

V\u000aI don't really like these kind of movies. When i first looked at the\u000aDVD cover i thought "oh well, this looks and sounds rather boring". I read on IMDb that it was the best rated film ever, so i thought i\u000amaybe i should just power through it. But oh my god! The movie was amazing. So powerful. I was just blown\u000aaway. And I don't really understand why. When i think about the plot\u000ait's so far from what i usually likes, but just following Andy\u000aDufresne's story is just so entertaining. The life in Shawshank is just\u000aso interesting. trough the whole movie you are rooting for Andy. The acting in this movie is also phenomenal. Tim Robbins and Morgan\u000aFreeman are just amazing. They carry this movie.This movie really fits everybody. I am not just saying that. I myself\u000ais a 16 year old boy who only watches sci-fi and action.\u000a

V\u000aI have just dished out what I would like to have been a minus out of\u000aten (0/10) for After Earth.I thought I would add balance.Can you give a film 10/10? I have watched many movies in my 50 years of\u000alife.I think if you read the plot etc you would not necessarily give\u000aShawshank Redemption the highest marks. How misleading.I have seen many very good movies. Some of them compete with Shawshank\u000aRedemption. May there be many more! However, Shawshank Redemption is the best movie I have ever seen. It is\u000aobviously hard to choose from many very good films. Every time I watch\u000aShawshank Redemption I sit back moved, entertained and anything else\u000ayou would like from a film.How I wish I had written for this movie. Directed it or had some\u000ainvolvement in it. I couldn't get better actors if I tried. I am just\u000aastounded.Maybe Shawshank is not perfect. Nothing is. But as it is the best film\u000aI have ever seen it simply must get 10/10!\u000a

V\u000a"Get busy living or get busy dying" An amazing movie. Easily one of the best movies made during the 90s and\u000adefinitely one of the top "prison" movies of all-time. Pretty much\u000aeverything about this movie works and works extremely well! The film\u000atouches upon many subjects, including the ideas of hope, redemption,\u000alove, loneliness, justice, life/death, friendship, endurance, fear,\u000apatience, inspiration and so much more. Watching this movie always makes me feel a million times better, and if\u000athat's not the greatest reason to watch a film, I don't know what is.\u000aGive it up to both Freeman and Robbins for completely engulfing their\u000acharacters with heart, soul and the spirit of humanity. I appreciated\u000athe message in this film, I absolutely loved the way it ended, I\u000asurrendered to its pace, I enjoyed all of its characters, I thought it\u000awas wonderfully photographed, I loved the score and I could seriously\u000awatch this movie 10 times a year and not bat an eyelash the whole way\u000athrough. And what kind of banner year was 1994?? PULP FICTION, FORREST GUMP, THE\u000aSHAWSHANK REDEMPTION and FOUR WEDDINGS AND A FUNERAL (one of my\u000afavorite romantic comedies of all-time) were all nominated for Best\u000aPicture. It's really too bad that most everyone got swept by that\u000achocolate-lover, but no matter what the Academy deemed "better" that\u000ayear, it goes without saying that SHAWSHANK has developed an even\u000agreater audience and following since that time, and is probably one of\u000athe most appreciated movies from the past twenty years (I usually NEVER\u000ahyperbolize any of my reviews (this is the BEST EVER...this is the\u000aWORST EVER...), but in this case, this film takes that cake and damn\u000awell, eats it too!). Love it, watch it, get your own motivation from it and surrender to its\u000aspirit which gives anyone in the world hope to do whatever they dream\u000ato do in life. It's like I quoted back at the top of this review, you\u000abetter "get busy living, or get busy dying". It don't get more black\u000aand white than that. Your choice. A true cinematic inspiration.

V\u000aThis is certainly a good movie, but it's not the greatest movie of all\u000atime. People hype up this movie too much which persuades other people\u000ato develop the same opinion as them. When people are asked what their\u000afavourite movie is, they often reply with Shawshank because they don't\u000awant to be seen to have a different opinion from the norm. People\u000ashould develop their own opinions. It's good to see that critics don't\u000arate this film as highly as the general public - I guess this proves\u000athat critics truly do know more about movies than the amateurs who\u000aconsider this film to be the greatest of all time. I also found this\u000afilm fairly predictable as it was obvious that he would escape in the\u000aend.\u000a

V\u000aBased on ratings by users, I can see why this film is rated number 1 on\u000aIMDb.A film about Andy Dufresne (Tim Robbins), who claims he was falsely\u000aimprisoned. He decides to adjust to life while incarcerated, and\u000abefriends a number of his fellow inmates, including Ellis Boyd Redding\u000a(Morgan Freeman). Andy establishes respect among his cohorts and even\u000athe prison guards by doing a number of things in improving life in the\u000aprison, including expanding a library and helping people do taxes. The\u000amen's friendships grow over the years as try to find, as the IMDb plot\u000aputs it, "solace and eventual redemption through acts of common\u000adecency." This movie is on the longer side, being over two hours long.\u000aHowever, the many elements in this film do not drag, making this movie\u000aan intriguing and exciting feature. The plot and subplots were solid,\u000ablending together well, and the cast of characters gave a strong,\u000adramatic and memorable performance. There were action, humor, drama,\u000atragedy and hope all mixed in, providing you a very entertaining film.There are far too many aspects of this film to be mentioned all at once\u000ain this review. Therefore, you will have to see and follow this movie\u000afor yourself to appreciate it. It is certainly worthy of its seven\u000aOscar nominations, including Best Picture (Forrest Gump won that year).\u000aA must-see for anybody.Grade A\u000a

V\u000aAn amazing movie. Easily one of the best movies made during the 90s and\u000adefinitely one of the top 'prison' movies of all-time. Pretty much\u000aeverything about this movie works and works extremely well!Freeman, who is simply a great actor, a man who has never struck a\u000afalse note in his career, both narrates this tale and anchors it with\u000ahis authoritative playing..Based on a short novel by Stephen King, "Rita Hayworth and Shawshank\u000aRedemption," the movie is as much a fantasy as any of King's horror\u000astories, yet thanks to screenwriter and director Frank Darabont, there\u000aisn't a moment we don't want to believe in. Darabont uniquely blends\u000ahumor and violence, sweetness and brutality, in what may be the best\u000a"feel-good" movie of the last twenty years. Ultimately, it is a story\u000aof hope and triumph, a tribute to Man's ability to overcome all odds.\u000aAndy never fails to astound us with his courage and cunning. He manages\u000ato ingratiate himself with the guards when he begins doing their tax\u000areturns and with the inmates when he helps build the finest prison\u000alibrary in Maine. (And managing to get them a cold beer on a hot day\u000adoesn't hurt, either.) Andy's final surprise, though, is his best, and\u000ait is enough to encourage even old Red to face the real world. .\u000a

V\u000athe Shawshank redemption is the best movie I have ever seen! defiantly\u000aworth the watch!! it is so amazing how Andy spent years having patience\u000ato dig out that tunnel so he can escape. And the scene where the\u000alibrarian hangs himself because he doesn't know what to do with his\u000alife touched my heart, it is truly amazing how one can adapt to an\u000aenvironment no matter how bad to the point if they leave there lost. I\u000adefiantly recommend this to everyone! it is amazing to look into the\u000alife of a prisoner and see and in a way experience what they did in\u000aprison, to watch Andy progress through the years and to change things\u000ain the prison is amazing. and I defiantly love the chess pieces it\u000agives the storyline a great prospective of the character. I love how\u000aAndy affects each prisoner and how it shows that when Ellis finally\u000agets parole that he actually goes to the place Andy asked him too.\u000aabsolutely amazing!\u000a

Bob Gunton also\u000aprovides a remarkable performance as the Warden. An incredibly dramatic\u000astory line followed by a satisfying ending plot twist. This piece of\u000aart truly deserves to be atop the IMDb Top 250 and should be watched by\u000aeverybody, as the quality of this work can appeal to anyone. Over two\u000ahours of incredible role play and drama that are sure to make you want\u000ato see this masterpiece at least twice.\u000a

You will root for Andy and Red, hate the warden, and\u000aadmire every single scene of the movie until his wonderful conclusion.\u000aA movie that teaches you about hope, determination and friendship in a\u000away you will never forget.

V\u000aWhy Shawshank Redemption is better than Forrest GumpForrest Gump and The Shawshank Redemption both came out in 1994, but\u000aForrest Gump gained much more award than The Shawshank Redemption.\u000aForrest Gump received six Academy Awards (Oscar Award) whereas The\u000aShawshank Redemption was only nominated for seven Academy Awards.\u000aHowever, Shawshank should have won more awards and it is a better movie\u000acompares to Gump.Shawshank has a comparatively lower profit according to box office.\u000aDespite its disappointing box office return, Warner Bros. shipped\u000a320,000 rental video copies throughout the United States, and it became\u000aone of the top rented films of 1995. The film's home viewing success\u000awas considered to be based on positive recommendations and repeat\u000acustomers. The film's Academy Award nominations enabled it to fare well\u000ain the video sales and cable TV viewings. In June 1997,TNT, an American\u000acable network, showed the film for the first time. The film was the\u000afirst feature in TNT's Saturday Night New Classics. A 2004 Sunday Times\u000aarticle suggested that TNT aired the film frequently from then on,\u000aabout once every two months. TV airings of the film accrued\u000arecord-breaking numbers.(Kermode) (Kermode, Mark (August 22, 2004).\u000aHope Spring eternalShawshank can be viewed for a thousand times and makes you think,\u000awhereas Forrest Gump can only make you laugh only on the first time you\u000asew it. Shawshank and Gump are totally opposite stories. The main actor\u000aForrest Gump in Forrest Gump is an extremely lucky man, whereas Andy is\u000aperhaps one of the most hapless guys. Forrest Gump is a comedy that you\u000acan watch lying on your sofa with your friends. However, Shawshank is a\u000amore serious movie and you probably will carry a sense of critic to\u000awatch that realistic masterpiece. People like excitement at the movies,\u000aand titles that provide it do well. Films about "redemption" are\u000aapproached with great wariness; a lot of people are not thrilled by the\u000aprospect of a great film - it sounds like work. But there's a hunger\u000afor messages of hope, and when a film offers one, it's likely to have\u000astaying power even if it doesn't grab an immediate audience.(Roger\u000aEbert) Shawshank is the kind of movie that you can watch throughout\u000ayour entire life because of the movie reflects realistic parts that\u000aimpact on everyone's life. You can see the society you are in right now\u000ais just like Shawshank prison. However, Forrest Gump is just a comedy\u000athat triggers you to laugh only the first time you see it. The Shawshank Redemption is a movie that can arouse you about the true\u000abeauty of life. However, Forrest Gump cannot trigger you think deeply\u000aabout the society and your life. Gump is more like a comedy reflects\u000aAmerican history. Shawshank uses the narrator's calm, observant voice\u000ato include us in the story of men who have formed a community behind\u000abars. It is deeper than most films; about continuity in a lifetime,\u000abased on friendship and hope.(Robert Ebert) We can find the description\u000aof friendship and the nature of the human beings in Shawshank.\u000aShawshank is extremely recommended by quite a few Chinese celebrities\u000abecause they have sort of echo with the main character Andy. It is\u000areasonable because lots of current high-ranked government officers such\u000aas Chairman Xi Jinping and successful businessmen were used to put into\u000aprison during Cultural Revolution. They have similar experience with\u000athe main character Andy. Andy's hope in prison reflects those\u000acelebrities' lives in prison. They all kept their dreams and fight for\u000athem until they success. Lucky guy Forrest Gump rarely appears in life,\u000abut Shawshank's characters appears in our real life everyday. You can\u000asee selfish politicians; young graduate students who strive for their\u000adreams every day. The dark aspect of society will eventually reveal to\u000ayou someday and you are not the lucky Gump who can success easily.\u000aShawshank will apply a life long lesson for you: keep your dream and\u000atreasure your friendship. The Shawshank Redemption receives 9.3 out of 10 in IMDb and 90% in\u000aRotten Tomatoes, whereas Forrest Gump gains 8.7 in IMDb and 71% in\u000aRotten Tomatoes. What's more, Shawshank also occupied first place in\u000athe Internet Movie Database worldwide vote of the 250 best films in\u000a1999. In the long term, The Shawshank definitely demonstrates its own\u000acharisma regardless of its production date. In the end, I think the conclusions of both movies are the deciding\u000afactor. While Gump's ending is fitting and emotional, it only completes\u000ait well. In the contract, the final half hour of Shawshank might be the\u000asingle greatest movie experience. When Andy takes off his clothes and\u000ahugs the entire world after he is free and the lightening flashes his\u000aeyes and audiences' eyes, you will finally be shocked by human being's\u000agreatness of pursuing freedom. When Andy and his friend Red hug on the\u000asplendid beach under golden sunshine, you will finally gratitude to the\u000aeternal friendship. All those conclusions on the front pages proved that The Shawshank is\u000adefinitely a better more compares to Forrest Gump and it desires to\u000areceive Academy Awards.\u000a

V\u000aI thought the movie was great. All of the aesthetic touches and\u000aattention to cinematic detail, the most beautiful part of the film lies\u000awithin its thematic material, such as its focus on the human desires\u000afor the most abstract concepts, like hope and freedom. These themes,\u000awhich concern things the human spirit undoubtedly yearns for, seem so\u000aintricately woven into the plot that it easily draws its audience in to\u000aits story. Though full of hardened criminals, your heart will go out to\u000athese men as they display the most basic of human emotions, and deliver\u000asome of the most quotable lines in a film to date. Like a great novel,\u000athis film manages to succeed at greater things than simply entertaining\u000aan audience. It tells the story most masterfully, illustrating\u000aprinciples and inspiring his audience to think. He leaves us a poignant\u000afilm with a powerful message of hope, and redemption, something we all\u000aseek.\u000a

V\u000aIn 1946, a banker named Andy Dufresne (Tim Robbins) is convicted of a\u000adouble murder, even though he stubbornly proclaims his innocence. He's\u000asentenced to a life term at the Shawshank State Prison in Maine, where\u000aanother lifer, Ellis "Red" Redding (Morgan Freeman), picks him as the\u000anew recruit most likely to crack under the pressure. The ugly realities\u000aof prison life are quickly introduced to Andy: a corrupt warden (Bob\u000aGunton), sadistic guards led by Capt. Byron Hadley (Clancy Brown), and\u000ainmates who are little better than animals, willing to use rape or\u000abeatings to insure their dominance. But Andy does not crack: he has the\u000ahope of the truly innocent, which (together with his smarts) allow him\u000ato prevail behind bars. He uses his banking skills to win favor with\u000athe warden and the guards, doing the books for Norton's illegal\u000abusiness schemes and keeping an eye on the investments of most of the\u000aprison staff. In exchange, he is able to improve the prison library and\u000abring some dignity and respect back to many of the inmates, including\u000aRed. Based on a story by Stephen King, The Shawshank Redemption was the\u000adirectorial debut of screenwriter Frank Darabont.\u000a

V\u000aI was recommended to watch Shawshank Redemption by my college accounts\u000ateacher. According to him this was the best movie he had seen in his\u000alifetime.

Once you start watching it, it\u000atakes you in so subtly that you won't even know and you're deep in the\u000amovie, and till the final curtains fall, no matter how important it is,\u000abut you just can't leave that screen! The way the story progresses on a\u000apath, you better get your popcorn ready before hitting that 'play'\u000abutton. From the starting of the film it grips you, based on utter\u000areality from the 90's, the way an innocent man gets sentenced for\u000amurder and is sent in jail with inmates as close to inhumane as they\u000acan be. In the wild world inside the jail, only Morgan Freeman is\u000asomeone he can talk to and trust on. And so begins his quest to get\u000afree from this prison. From doing errands for cigarettes, to escaping\u000ainmates trying to rape you, he finally finds his way out! And the way\u000ahe does that is what steals all the attention! Brilliance! You can't\u000aafford to miss out this movie, go get it today and leave a review.Shawshank Redemption is and will always be the BEST that ever came out\u000aof Hollywood!A MUST WATCH RECOMMENDATION TO EVERYONE!\u000a

V\u000aFrom long time I am a member of IMDb but I never try write a review.\u000aBut in this case I can not ignore writing review option.The screenplay was written by Frank Darabont, who based it on the\u000anovella "Rita Hayworth and the Shawshank Redemption" by Stephen King.\u000aHe adapts the material so well that he really transcends it, turning\u000athe film into a work of art. Many avid readers will claim the book is\u000aalways better than the movie, but that is simply not the case here.\u000aKing is a tremendous writer, but even he can't shade and color the\u000aprison the way that Darabont does, which sets the mood for the entire\u000afilm. The characters King created in the book are deeper and more well\u000adrawn in the film in large part because of Darabont's script.Many moviegoers turn their noses up at the thought of a movie about the\u000atriumph of the human spirit. However, even those jaded film fans will\u000alove "The Shawshank Redemption" because it sets a new standard for\u000afilms in this genre. It is an unapologetically emotional and sometimes\u000asentimental take on friendship and life, even when that life is spent\u000ain a cage, and will make viewers laugh, cry, and reflect on their own\u000alives in ways that very few movies can. It may not have won a single\u000aOscar, but it will win your heart, and perhaps that is more important.\u000a

V\u000aThe best movies are ones that touch the soul. It takes a movie like The\u000aShawshank Redemption to touch the soul. Shawshank Redemption was my\u000afavorite movie when I first saw it, and I only realized its weakness\u000alater, this movie will look a lot worst the second time you watch it\u000awith its mysteries revealed and questions fully answered because one of\u000athe great qualities of this movie is its impossibility to guess which\u000adirection the story will take until it reaches the end. However, the\u000amovie celebrates the determination of the human spirit "There's\u000asomething inside you that they can't get to, that they can't touch.\u000aIt's yours.\u000a

I\u000acould definitely watch it again and again and would have the same\u000areactions. As someone said in another review: Excellent acting,\u000asoundtrack, photography, etc. Tim Robbins was the perfect guy for the\u000arole and all the other actors did great too. Do buy this movie because\u000ayou not only will be able to enjoy it but you will learn a lot from\u000ayour own reflections on various aspects of life and will be glad that\u000ayou are free. The movie itself has a strong message with much impact.\u000aDon't miss it by any chance, there's a limited number of movies that\u000awill make you feel this emotional about being free and alive.\u000a

Just think, work, patience,\u000aand believe. This is the way. I watch this movie every time I want to\u000abe more motivated. I saw this movie last night and I tell my friends\u000aand my family that we can't play with life, and we need to do\u000aeverything correct to make a good way and get health days.

V\u000aShawshank Redemption is a defining moment in cinema.The movie (directed by Frank Darabont) takes a straight-forward, soul-\u000asearching novel by horror icon Stephen King and transforms it into a\u000asomber, bloated prison drama designed to fill you up with inspiration.Thanks to supreme performances and beautiful cinematography, you get\u000athat inspirational jump-start frame after frame. And you get generous\u000ahelpings of the novella's deft ironic humour about a inmate quietly\u000aturning a corrupt system against itself.A small box office release which made its name once released on home\u000avideo, this movie is well worth a watch if you happened to have missed\u000ait first time around.\u000a

V\u000athe most beautiful part of the film lies within its thematic material,\u000asuch as its focus on the human desires for the most abstract concepts,\u000alike hope and freedom. These themes, which concern things the human\u000aspirit undoubtedly yearns for, seem so intricately woven into the plot\u000athat it easily draws its audience in to its story. Though full of\u000ahardened criminals, your heart will go out to these men as they display\u000athe most basic of human emotions, and deliver some of the most quotable\u000alines in a film to date. Like a great novel, this film manages to\u000asucceed at greater things than simply entertaining an audience.\u000aDarabont tells his story most masterfully, illustrating principles and\u000ainspiring his audience to think. He leaves us a poignant film with a\u000apowerful message of hope, and redemption, something we all seek.This film manages to redeem Hollywood in the eyes of people who feared\u000ait long lost in a dark sea of clichés and predictability. Darabont\u000ashows us that artists still work in the Hollywood studios and\u000aproduction facilities. These artists show their capability to produce\u000aart; real art that inspires you to look at the deeper aspects of life\u000aand the world around you. The Shawshank Redemption delivers much-needed\u000abreath of fresh air for anyone who realizes the capability of film. It\u000aproves that masters of the craft still live on this earth, and still\u000abless us with timeless masterpieces that we will never forget.\u000a

V\u000aWhenever I talk about this movie with my friends, I do not even refer\u000ato it by title, but rather as "The Movie". When I say "The Movie", my\u000afriends know exactly what I'm talking about. In fact the main reason\u000athat me and my friends don't refer to it by title is because this movie\u000ais so great, that we do not feel worthy enough to say it's name in\u000avain! I still remember the first time I saw The Shawshank Redemption.\u000aSome friends of mine and I went to see it at one of those "Budget\u000aTheaters" over the summer of 1995. None of us really knew anything\u000aabout the movie, but we had heard that it was pretty good. So, not\u000ahaving any real expectations, we saw it. When the final credits rolled\u000aand the lights came on in the theater, all of us just sat there with\u000aour jaws hanging down on the floor. I turned my head towards my friend\u000aBob and said "That was the greatest movie I have ever seen in my entire\u000alife!" There's really no other way I can put it in words. Every moment\u000aof this movie captivated me and inspired me to believe in the one true\u000athing in life...... "HOPE". This movie is sad, uplifting, inspiring,\u000aharsh, cold, funny (at the right times), jaw-dropping, and\u000aheart-warming all at the same time. I get chills every time I watch\u000athis film and this film contains the greatest ending (which takes place\u000aover the last 30 minutes or so)in movie history! How it all just "comes\u000atogether" is so incredible and uplifting. I should also mention the\u000amusic in this movie is nearly flawless as well, and the soundtrack is a\u000a"must buy" for any music fan. The only bad thing about this movie is\u000athe fact that I know I will never see a better movie, no matter how\u000amany I may see. I've seen many movies over the past few years, many\u000aexcellent films. However, every time I walk out of the theater, I turn\u000ato my friend or family member that I saw it with and I say, "That was a\u000agreat movie, but it wasn't nearly as good as 'you know what'!" There\u000ahave been many movies over the past few years that thought would really\u000amove me or that I might one day call my "favorite of all time", but\u000athey've all fallen far short of "The Shawshank Redemption". So, if you\u000ahave yet to see this movie, please run to the video store immediately.\u000aYou're guaranteed to find it in the "employee picks" section. And if it\u000aisn't in that section, then you should tell the employees there that\u000athere is something seriously wrong with them. If you have seen this\u000amovie, go see it again. If you haven't bought your own copy yet, buy\u000aone. In fact buy two, and put one in a fire-proof safe, just in case of\u000aan emergency. :o) So, you want a 1-10 rating??? I give it a 13!!!!!!\u000a

V\u000aWhy do I want to write the 234th comment on The Shawshank Redemption? I\u000aam not sure - almost everything that could be possibly said about it\u000ahas been said. But like so many other people who wrote comments, I was\u000aand am profoundly moved by this simple and eloquent depiction of hope\u000aand friendship and redemption. The only other movie I have ever seen that effects me as strongly is To\u000aKill a Mockingbird. Both movies leave me feeling cleaner for having\u000awatched them.I didn't intend to see this movie at all: I do not like prison movies\u000aand I don't normally watch them. I work at a branch library and one day\u000aas I was checking The Shawshank Redemption out to one of our older\u000apatrons, she said to me, "Whenever I feel down or depressed, I check\u000aout this movie and watch it and it always makes me feel better." At the\u000atime, I thought that was very strange. One day there was nothing on TV\u000aexcept things I absolutely would not watch under any circumstance or\u000athings that I had seen too many times already. I remembered what she\u000asaid, so I watched it. I have watched it many many times since then and\u000ait gets better with every showing.No action, no special effects - just men in prison uniforms talking to\u000aeach other.The Shawshank Redemption and To Kill a Mockingbird are the best movies\u000aI have ever seen. I do not judge it by it's technical merits - I don't\u000areally care about that. I have read that Citizen Kane or The Godfather\u000aor this or that movie is the best movie ever made. They may have the\u000abest technique or be the most influential motion pictures ever made,\u000abut not the best. The best movies are ones that touch the soul. It\u000atakes a movie like The Shawshank Redemption to touch the soul.\u000a

V\u000aA Review of The Shawshank RedemptionThis film acts like a commentary on prison life for long term\u000aprisoners, but its real theme is one of hope. It draws us in quickly\u000awith the drama of a cheating wife and the actions of a scorned husband.\u000aHowever, what really brings us in are the deep soothing tones of Morgan\u000aFreeman's (Driving Miss Daisy, Unforgiven) voice-over as Ellis Boyd\u000a"Red" Redding speaking about his insights into Andy Dufresne.Andy Dufresne is the scorned husband, played by Tim Robbins (Bull\u000aDurham, Mystic River), who is accused and convicted of murder even\u000athough the evidence is circumstantial and he maintains his innocence.\u000aHe spends the next twenty years at Shawshank State Prison where he\u000ameets Red. Red is one of the guys in the prison who has a way of\u000agetting anything one might want smuggled into the prison. One of the\u000afirst things that Red notices about Andy is that he conducts himself as\u000aa free man who is unaffected by the surrounding prison. Andy has\u000adifficulty at first as he falls prey to a group of inmates called "the\u000asisters" and referred to as bull queers. This goes on until Andy shows\u000ahis worth as banker to the lead guard, Captain Hadley played by Clancy\u000aBrown (Highlander, Starship Troopers). Hadley provided Andy's inmates\u000awith beer in exchange for Andy's services. The beer made the inmates\u000afeel like free men again and Andy's services got him noticed by the\u000awarden. The warden, played by Bob Gunton (Patch Adams, Evita), provided\u000aAndy with protection from the "sisters", allowed him to fix-up the\u000alibrary, and allowed him to help some inmates earn their high school\u000adiplomas in exchange for Andy's help with laundering money that\u000aproceeded from the warden's many schemes. So, we are presented with a\u000ableak situation that is reinforced by dirty sets and mostly gray and\u000ablue colors. The make-up used to age the actors gradually over twenty\u000ayears, combined with the acting, work together to make us believe that\u000aall of this could happen and is real. We are made to feel sorry for\u000athese inmates most of whom are suffering the consequences of their own\u000ahorrible crimes. And, as if doing the dirty work of the self-righteous\u000awho stand in judgment over Andy isn't enough, the warden has the one\u000aperson who can get Andy out of prison executed. In spite of all of this\u000aAndy maintains a hope for the future that "they" can't touch. The\u000aShawshank Redemption is a really good film that leaves the viewer with\u000aa feeling of triumph and a life lesson that goes beyond prison walls.\u000a

She\u000acries out, hitting her head against the wall but not caring, grinding\u000aagainst him, clawing his back, shivering with the sensations running\u000athrough her. He carries her across the room with her legs wrapped\u000aaround him. They fall onto the bed.\u000a

V\u000aThe movie, The Shawshank Redemption, which came out in 1994 is about\u000atwo main characters Andy Dufresne (Tim Robbins) and Ellis Boyd 'Red'\u000aRedding (Morgan Freeman) and their journey through prison in the\u000a1940's. Andy was falsely accused and sentenced to life imprisonment for\u000athe murder of his wife and her lover. This movie represents integrity\u000aas Andy never gives up and he knows that in the end he will be free as\u000ahe was falsely accused. He knew that one day the prison guards and\u000awarden would pay their dues for how they ran their prison. This movie\u000ashows it all and is absolutely a 10 out of 10. My favorite scene was when Andy was when Andy gets access to the room\u000awhere the microphone is set up to talk over the intercom. Andy plays a\u000arecord of two ladies singing and all of the prisoners sit in awe not\u000aknowing what to think or how to feel. Red makes the statement that he\u000adoesn't know what the two ladies were singing let alone saying but how\u000ait brought peace over his mind and the others as the music was calming,\u000asoothing, and a sight of the real world. This is a movie that you can watch it again right after you just\u000afinished watching it. There is so much anticipation and as a viewer you\u000aget wrapped up in the scene and the emotions that are the prisoners are\u000afeeling. Another scene that really made me nervous was when Red is about to\u000aleave to meet Andy in Buxton County and he signs his name on the board\u000awhere a previous prison member hung himself and had signed his name\u000abefore he committed suicide. In this scene, the viewers watches Red\u000asign his name and assume that he is going to hang himself but the scene\u000aflashes forward to Red digging up a box that Andy had given him\u000adirections to. In that box, there is cash and a post car of where Andy\u000ais at. This film is absolutely amazing and I recommend it to anyone. I could\u000ago on forever about this movie but it is a must see, it's a movie that\u000awill have you thinking about it after you watch it. The friendship that\u000aAndy and Red made was unbreakable; they had hope in one another. Each\u000acharacter showed determination and courage, this is a movie that you\u000awont regret watching. On the other hand, a children's movie that shows integrity would be the\u000amovie Antz. As adults watch Shawshank they can relate on multiple\u000alevels as they have gone through life experiences where they have been\u000afalsely accused or have been in a situation where they know if they\u000astay true to themselves then the right thing will happen. Same goes for\u000achildren in the movie Antz as Flick never gives up on himself or the\u000afact that he is trying to help his colony even when they are all\u000aagainst him.\u000a

V\u000aYes it's a fantastic movie. It does hit a huge range of genres and does\u000adeserve a high placement. However, it was so talked up as "the perfect\u000amovie" that it did lead to a disappointment the first time round. I did\u000athoroughly enjoy it but it isn't a movie that can be enjoyed and\u000aexperienced in any mood or situation. It's a fantastic movie but here's\u000aa list of moods that this movie will NOT work in: Absolute chill,\u000aInnocent, Brain dead, Crazy hypoAnd if you're already feeling down, maybe find something else to pick\u000ayou up. Definitely give it a go and see why it's so high and you will\u000aenjoy it if you sit back, relax, and engage in the story.\u000a

V\u000aThe Shawshank Redemption is one the best movies i have ever watched,\u000aacting crew are amazing as well as everything in the movie but i don't\u000athink this movie should be the top rated movie of all time.the movie is truly an inspiring film where the based on true story\u000amakes it more amazing although the movie gets the watching people a\u000alittle bit cold but all in all i can say its a nice movie. as i was\u000areading trough the other reviews of this movie, i came crossed a review\u000awhich said and i quote "The best movies are ones that touch the souls".\u000ai disagree, best movies should be rated according to many aspects but\u000aunfortunately the main contributing factor of rating movies nowadays is\u000abased on "other peoples votes". all in all, i have to say if you haven't watched the movie yet, you are\u000anot a movie person\u000a

V\u000aIt turned my thought that how to achieve the goal with Patient. I am\u000areally amazed. There is no confusion that theme of this story is nice.\u000aI like to watch straggling life.

What's going\u000ato happen? Finally He broke the security and got the plan which he\u000amade. I think noting bad here when he is a victim. There is no way for\u000ahim to do. So, It's was a perfect attack in the root of corruption. If\u000amost of the victims in this world follow this way with Patient I think\u000ait will be possible to make a little change. Although it's not so easy\u000ato find similar minded human.\u000a

V\u000aThis movie is really great, I enjoyed every minute of it. I want them\u000ato make a sequel to it. I want them to add more graphics get new actors\u000aand also try and get better locations.What I really like about this\u000amovie is that it really captures that feeling of reconnecting with\u000apeople and how hard that can actually be. As I'm slowly closing in on\u000a40 you see that you do not see the friends you hung out with as much\u000aanymore. You still talk to them and get along, but do not have the same\u000aconnection anymore, simply because you do not share as much anymore as\u000ayou are used to. Of course those relationships have been pushed to\u000acomedic proportions and are a great source for a lot of laughs. Simon\u000aPegg steals the show as the boy trapped in a man's body and the story\u000awhich initially starts out like a pub crawl soon turns into a pub brawl\u000aand an awesome one at that.\u000a

V\u000aForget about what others (including myself) might suggest you'll\u000adiscover in "The Shawshank Redemption;" when you watch it, you'll\u000aidentify something very personal in your own life with a scene, a\u000acharacter, or a moment in this uncomplicated movie. When you need hope,\u000ayou'll look for Shawshank. When you want to believe in the will of\u000aovercoming even the greatest obstacles, Shawshank will uplift you in\u000aways that you can't find in movies today.Some liken the film to some kind of spiritual awakening. Of course,\u000asome can go to a church or mosque to find enlightenment and Faith in\u000ahumanity, but most places of worship are open only certain days or\u000atimes. But when you need affirmation of the lasting bond of friendships\u000athat prevail over the most dire circumstances, Shawshank will give it\u000ato you. It makes grown men (like me) cry, still. I wonder whether\u000aShawshank was truly meant for viewing in the privacy of the home,\u000abecause it is a personal experience that really makes you look inward.\u000aNominated for seven, this is the best film that never one a single\u000aOscar.\u000a

V\u000aA true masterpiece of modern cinema , with Forrest Gump and Pulp\u000aFiction , a film that has left its mark in the past 10 years. Frank\u000aDarabont 's film , based on Stephen King material , captures in a way\u000athat could not be more memorable triumph of human spirit over a hostile\u000adestiny . Drama is built and crafted by the most thorough detail:\u000afine-tuned scenario , congealed story that makes you cry for a happy\u000aend , which, although coming, though still not fully satisfy you (why\u000amany films have done that ? ) . Each element of the decor brings its\u000acontribution corresponding to the emotional tension of the film\u000adeveloped . "The Shawshank Redemption" does not offer a tremendous\u000apsychological challenge or any rational incentive contrary, his charm\u000alies in the emotional force that surrounds you slowly, carefully graded\u000aand highly inspiring. Impressive great emotional impact , the film you\u000ajust steal a special atmosphere , a slight reconciled melancholy that\u000amakes you actually feel your blood human . Drama protagonist move upon\u000ayou and they end up pushing the contemplation of the greatness of the\u000ahuman being. But the film is balanced , never falls into a bathos ,\u000avulgar or boring . Cadence dose slowly and subtly flowing impressionism\u000a, and finally can conclude proud : over all wrongs , than all the\u000asufferings , miseries rises above all human splendor . Great triumph of\u000ahuman values \u200b\u200b: patience, friendship , perseverance , selflessness is\u000aportrayed as a human universal film without falling into the trap\u000aAmerican ( few directors escapes this trap , see Ridley Scott ,\u000aGladiator or Mel Gibson - Braveheart ) . The picture is superb, the\u000asets have a special importance , assembly includes interesting symmetry\u000a, direction is gorgeous , Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman remain a\u000atandem famous all do their duty and drain your last tear ... but not in\u000aan insidious , commercial and regret , the film is not at all a hoax ,\u000aa scam , but has a substance perfect emotional density , highlighting ,\u000ain a grand exquisite essences of humanity .\u000a

V\u000a"The Shawshank Redemption" is one of those movies that I wished I'd\u000aseen on the big screen. Thanks to videos, however, all was not lost.\u000aWhether intentional or not, this film is about grace and hope, as well\u000aas the redemption that can occur even in the most dark and degrading\u000acorners of our world. Conceived and produced by the secular film\u000acommunity, this engrossing film stands as one of the most entertaining,\u000athought-provoking dramas of this century.But, it's a film for mature audiences. It takes us to a setting that's\u000adisturbing, uses language that's raw, showcases supporting characters\u000awho are far from ideal role models, and reforms not one villain by the\u000aending credits. It deals with sex and violence, but never in a prurient\u000away. There are numerous brutal, occasionally fatal, beatings. No scene\u000ais foisted onto us to incite our own lust or rage, but clearly shows\u000athis type of action as harmful and wrong. The movie's theme is\u000aredemption from a hellish place; it couldn't have been made without\u000athese elements. I highly recommend watching it with an older teenager\u000aand discussing it together in the light of many of the points I bring\u000aup in this review.The hero, Andy Dufresne, is wrongly accused of killing his wife and\u000areceives two life sentences. Steadily and quietly in prison, he wards\u000aoff the bitterness against that injustice and the further hardships he\u000asuffers by doing good for others, even those that despise him. The\u000anarrator is Red, a hardened and resourceful inmate who repeatedly warns\u000ahis friends that "Hope is a dangerous thing." The prison warden is a\u000ahypocritical fanatic who uses the Lord, the Bible, and the people for\u000ahis own scheming, murdering purposes. Don't let this characterization\u000aturn you off. It's not the hackneyed Hollywood cheap-shot believers\u000ahave come to expect. To make this moving allegory work, it's a\u000anecessary depiction. In the best-seller of all time, a blameless Hero's\u000achief antagonist was the conservative religious coalition of the day\u000athat carried out a sinister plot in order to maintain its own political\u000apower. The picture is a truthful, thoughtful warning for Christian\u000aAmerica today and shouldn't be dismissed out of hand.In fact, there are many similarities between the heroes of "The\u000aShawshank Redemption" and The Gospel. The central characters are both\u000awrongly accused. One receives two life sentences and the other is\u000acrucified. Neither are readily esteemed by their contemporaries. Andy's\u000aa bankerhow can the average indebted-up-to-their-neck consumer\u000asympathize with that? Jesus is a Nazarenehow can any good thing come\u000afrom Nazareth? (John 1:45,46). While Andy is certainly flawed, the good\u000awork he does while in prison actually serves a ruthless political end\u000athat ends up holding him captive. Jesus was ridiculed and executed by\u000athe same people He came to free.While the characters are believable and the script excellent, the\u000acinematography provides the important "view" in the film. Thick walls,\u000aimposing fences, and confined spaces remind us of the oppression. The\u000aguards relentless marching and the heavy bars slamming open and\u000aslamming shut reinforce it. Dull, chipped walls in every room surround\u000athe dulled, chipped lives of utterly hopeless men. But the camera\u000adoesn't linger too long in this kind of darkness.Hope is scattered throughout this excellent film. Italian opera\u000abroadcast over loudspeakers and senate appropriations for library\u000abooks. An ice cold one down your throat and the thought of a "place of\u000ano memory" (Hebrews 8:12). High school equivalence exams and a\u000aharmonica. Alexander Dumas and Rita Haworth.Hope triumphs gloriously in the end. It only takes 19 years. Andy\u000aescapes the hard way and makes it possible for his friend to leave an\u000aeasier way. A note to Red reads, "I'll keep an eye out for you and the\u000achessboard ready for you." Strikingly similar to Christ's words to us,\u000a"In my Father's house there are many rooms I am going there to prepare\u000aa place for you." (John 14:2,3) In Christian theology, our Hope is\u000acertain and our good future already begun because of Christ's death,\u000aburial, and resurrectionpictures you can't miss in "The Shawshank\u000aRedemption" .\u000a

V\u000aWhy do I want to write the 234th comment on The Shawshank Redemption? I\u000aam not sure - almost everything that could be possibly said about it\u000ahas been said. But like so many other people who wrote comments, I was\u000aand am profoundly moved by this simple and eloquent depiction of hope\u000aand friendship and redemption. The only other movie I have ever seen that effects me as strongly is To\u000aKill a Mockingbird. Both movies leave me feeling cleaner for having\u000awatched them.I didn't intend to see this movie at all: I do not like prison movies\u000aand I don't normally watch them. I work at a branch library and one day\u000aas I was checking The Shawshank Redemption out to one of our older\u000apatrons, she said to me, "Whenever I feel down or depressed, I check\u000aout this movie and watch it and it always makes me feel better." At the\u000atime, I thought that was very strange. One day there was nothing on TV\u000aexcept things I absolutely would not watch under any circumstance or\u000athings that I had seen too many times already. I remembered what she\u000asaid, so I watched it. I have watched it many many times since then and\u000ait gets better with every showing.No action, no special effects - just men in prison uniforms talking to\u000aeach other.The Shawshank Redemption and To Kill a Mockingbird are the best movies\u000aI have ever seen. I do not judge it by it's technical merits - I don't\u000areally care about that. I have read that Citizen Kane or The Godfather\u000aor this or that movie is the best movie ever made. They may have the\u000abest technique or be the most influential motion pictures ever made,\u000abut not the best. The best movies are ones that touch the soul. It\u000atakes a movie like The Shawshank Redemption to touch the soul.\u000a

V\u000aThe story begins with the trial of a young banker, Andy Dufrense,\u000avictimized by circumstantial evidence, resulting in a conviction for\u000athe murder of his wife and her lover. After a quick conviction, Andy\u000afinds himself serving a life sentence at Shawshank prison, with no hope\u000aof parole. He exists in this prison only in appearance, keeping his\u000amind free from the drab walls around him. His ability to do this\u000aresults in the gaining of respect from his fellow inmates, but most of\u000aall from Ellis Redding. Ellis, commonly referred to as Red, finds\u000againful use of his entrepreneurial spirit within the drab walls of\u000aShawshank by dealing in contraband and commodities rare to the confines\u000aof prison. Andy's demeanor and undeniable sense of hope causes Red to\u000atake a deeper look at himself, and the world around him. Andy proves to\u000aRed and the other inmates that in the conventional walls of Shawshank\u000aprison convention will find no home in his lifestyle.By creating the film's firm foundation, the meticulously chiseled\u000ascreenplay paved the way for this film's success. Frank Darabont\u000aoutdoes himself with the phenomenal adaptation of Stephen King's\u000aequally noteworthy novella, Rita Hayworth and Shawshank Redemption. In\u000athis novella, King demonstrates that he can break free from the genre\u000ahe dominates and still create a marvelous piece of modern literature.\u000aThough the film mirrors the novella in many ways, Darabont illustrates\u000aa focused objective of improving upon the areas where the novella came\u000aup short, resulting in one of the best book to film transitions ever.While maintaining some of the poetic and moving dialogue of the\u000anovella, Darabont also proves that a film's score can generate a great\u000adeal of emotional response from its audience, as dialogue does. He\u000aemploys the cunning Thomas Newman, son of the legendary Hollywood\u000acomposer, Alfred Newman. Darabont shows recognition for the film's\u000aneeds by employing Newman, who makes the gentle piano chords whisper\u000asoftly to the viewer, as if a part of the scripted dialogue. Newman\u000alends himself to individualism and tends to drive more towards the\u000aunique in the realm of score composition. His effort in Shawshank did\u000anot go unnoticed, as his score received an Oscar nomination in 1995.\u000aWhile unique and independent, Newman's score never once intrudes on\u000ayour concentration or distracts from the film.With work from vast array of talented scene designers, costume\u000adesigners, composers, cinematographers, and various other Hollywood\u000aartists, the cast of The Shawshank Redemption had a strong foundation\u000ato work with. The marvelous cast of this film will dazzle you with some\u000aof the most convincing performances you will witness in a film. While\u000aboth Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman shine as Andy and Red,\u000arespectively, the true spectacle of acting lies within the plethora of\u000aamazing supporting actors who easily disappear into their roles. Most\u000anoticeable of these, the veteran film star James Whitmore, who portrays\u000athe elderly Brooks Hatlen. Brooks, a man incarcerated for an\u000aunmentioned crime for so long that he finds himself attached to the\u000aShawshank and the daily life he has lead. Each of these actors show a\u000atrue dedication to their art, and a focused purpose in their\u000amotivations, creating a convincing setting that never once caters to\u000aanything unbelievable.With all of the aesthetic touches and attention to cinematic detail,\u000athe most beautiful part of the film lies within its thematic material,\u000asuch as its focus on the human desires for the most abstract concepts,\u000alike hope and freedom. These themes, which concern things the human\u000aspirit undoubtedly yearns for, seem so intricately woven into the plot\u000athat it easily draws its audience in to its story. Though full of\u000ahardened criminals, your heart will go out to these men as they display\u000athe most basic of human emotions, and deliver some of the most quotable\u000alines in a film to date. Like a great novel, this film manages to\u000asucceed at greater things than simply entertaining an audience.\u000aDarabont tells his story most masterfully, illustrating principles and\u000ainspiring his audience to think. He leaves us a poignant film with a\u000apowerful message of hope, and redemption, something we all seek.This film manages to redeem Hollywood in the eyes of people who feared\u000ait long lost in a dark sea of clichés and predictability. Darabont\u000ashows us that artists still work in the Hollywood studios and\u000aproduction facilities. These artists show their capability to produce\u000aart; real art that inspires you to look at the deeper aspects of life\u000aand the world around you. The Shawshank Redemption delivers much-needed\u000abreath of fresh air for anyone who realizes the capability of film. It\u000aproves that masters of the craft still live on this earth, and still\u000abless us with timeless masterpieces that we will never forget.\u000a

V\u000aIn 1946, a banker named Andy Dufresne (Tim Robbins) is convicted of a\u000adouble murder, even though he stubbornly proclaims his innocence. He's\u000asentenced to a life term at the Shawshank State Prison in Maine, where\u000aanother lifer, Ellis "Red" Redding (Morgan Freeman), picks him as the\u000anew recruit most likely to crack under the pressure. The ugly realities\u000aof prison life are quickly introduced to Andy: a corrupt warden (Bob\u000aGunton), sadistic guards led by Capt. Byron Hadley (Clancy Brown), and\u000ainmates who are little better than animals, willing to use rape or\u000abeatings to insure their dominance. But Andy does not crack: he has the\u000ahope of the truly innocent, which (together with his smarts) allow him\u000ato prevail behind bars. He uses his banking skills to win favor with\u000athe warden and the guards, doing the books for Norton's illegal\u000abusiness schemes and keeping an eye on the investments of most of the\u000aprison staff. In exchange, he is able to improve the prison library and\u000abring some dignity and respect back to many of the inmates, including\u000aRed. Based on a story by Stephen King, The Shawshank Redemption was the\u000adirectorial debut of screenwriter Frank Darabont. ~ Mark Deming, Rovi\u000a

V\u000aAndy Dufresne (Tim Robbins) is an accountant who, accused of murdering\u000ahis wife, entered Shawshank prison in 1947. Dufresne, just like\u000aeverybody else, claims he is innocent. Only in his case, it's actually\u000atrue. Pretty soon his stoic manner gets the attention of narrator\u000aRedding (Morgan Freeman). Redding is the local smuggler. He admires\u000aAndy's positive attitude. Even the tough regime of Shawshank prison\u000acan't break him.The life in Shawshank prison is presented as metaphor for our real\u000asociety. Wherein the "prisoners of life" accept their fate and stop\u000adreaming to avoid being disappointed. Offcourse there's always one who\u000ais determined to break through.The Shawshank Redemption is a story about hope, friendship and\u000asurviving within the walls of a heavily guarded prison. This movie is a\u000ashiny jewel. It tastes like the freedom of a silver-blue bird a summer\u000aday.

V\u000aReview #1 of "My Top ten Favorite Movies" Reviews I'm not going to go through a whole review, since there are plenty of\u000areviews detailing why this is the greatest movie of all time. I'm just\u000agonna give a quote:"The Shawshank Redemption is the best movie I have ever seen because of\u000aits ability to capture raw emotion." I'm also going to elaborate on the three biggest reasons people dislike\u000athis movie.1. It's too slow.The Shawshank Redemption may be a tad slow, but it is justified. I\u000abelieve director Frank Darabont wanted to show Andy's time at Shawshank\u000aby showing how slow prison time really is. Some movies are just slow;\u000athis movie does it for a deeper reason, adding to Shawshank's genius.2. Andy Dufresne barely shows emotion.Those people obviously didn't get what kind of character Andy was. Tim\u000aRobbins did this on purpose. Andy was quiet, mellow, and was obviously\u000aquite shocked and angry he was going to prison for a crime he didn't\u000ado. Did you really expect the man to jump up and start singing\u000a"Kumbaya"? No! So I don't get what the problem is. The fact that he\u000aacted like this just added to the realistic atmosphere of the movie.3. This is not realistic.Oh yes your right, since these men in prison smoked, cursed, drank, and\u000akept their eyes peeled in the shower room for potential rapists. That\u000ais not realistic at all. (sarcastic) Overall, I think some of the hate\u000aon Shawshank is solely because it is the highest rated movie on IMDb,\u000afor a fact. (User rating is 9.3 to this date). I think some people hate\u000athis movie because everyone else loves it, and that is a bad way to\u000athink about anything, not just movies.HandHStudios Rating: 10/10, and everything higher.\u000a

V\u000athe main effect used in the movie is that the inside story is kept\u000apreserved for most of the time in the movie and revealed suddenly at\u000athe last movement . this was a great journey. the story narration of\u000athe movie is perfect.the direction of the movie from starting to the\u000alast is very much appreciatedthis movie also teaches us that whatever be the way we have to struggle\u000acontinuously in our life. and one day we will o=purely get success.as a whole it was a very good movie and this type of movie should be\u000aappreciated. may be it does not have a very true story but this movie\u000aproves that only script does not matters\u000a

V\u000aThe Shawshank Redemption is one of the best all-round movies of all\u000atime. The story is powerful in that it represents real issues in\u000asociety, not petty ones that a lot of movies nowadays base their\u000astories off of, that are usually unrealistic anyways. The characters\u000aare interesting and have strong character arcs, and the highs and lows\u000aare extreme highs and lows, there's not doubt you'll be moved by this\u000astory. And to top it all off the acting is well executed, believable,\u000aand entertaining. It raised the bar for movies for ever. If you haven't\u000aseen this movie yet I'd say it is a "must see movie" in my books. Do\u000anot hesitate to give it a couple hours of your time, you will not be\u000adisappointed.\u000a

V\u000aGreat movie I was in love with it from beginning to end. I would love\u000ato have part of the cast. Morgan freeman is spellbinding, and\u000acaptivating. Steven King did a great job at putting this together. cant\u000await to see what else he has in store for us. I would love to see an\u000aexpansion on the plot. where are they now, what has happen to them was\u000ait a happily ever after. The acting was superb, from all characters,\u000areminded me of Micheal Clark Duncan and the green mile, once i started\u000awatching i could not take my eyes away. there should be more movies\u000alike this more love for the art of film, to really give what it takes\u000ato create a wonderful masterpiece such as this. I am hoping that\u000asomething will be created soon that will be able to live up to the\u000alegend of this movie.\u000a

V\u000aI'll go ahead and speak plainly about events from the movie, not caring\u000atoo much about spoiling or not. If you haven't seen the movie and do\u000anot want the major plot twists told beforehand you should avoid this\u000areview.I must admit I was one of those guys who went on a hunt for this movie\u000ajust because it is the highest rated movie on this website. It was\u000asecond place on general public top 250 when I decided I had to see it.\u000aNot to mention most recent high-rated films I am familiar with to a\u000apoint of remembering, or hearing about; this one wasn't the case.To tell the truth I watched the movie three times now and I still\u000ahaven't seen anything resembling greatness to be the highest acclaimed\u000afilm in the most important website about cinema in the planet.It's not bad, but I found overshadowed by the immense hype surrounding\u000ait. It's certainly 7/10 material in my book, but the idiotic fanboys\u000aalong with the constant praise for it being superior film-making just\u000aslides it down a notch or two.The story about a guy that is innocently convicted and how his life\u000adevelops inside the prison with a friend named Red and a few surprises\u000ahere and there is well told. The so-called message it carries? Well, it\u000aseems people are all about that "hope" thing since he indeed is\u000ainnocent of the crime he's in for, and how eventually he escapes prison\u000aleaving behind a hostile environment that never really believed in him,\u000aa warden that exploited his dry as much as he could, and of course\u000abeating the error of the system in his own game.He loses his whole life while at it though, but who cares, it's all\u000aabout hope. It's hard to relate anything to real life since even the\u000afinale seems too wonderful to be true. The guy just goes to an obscure\u000aisland and lives happily ever after. Even Red drops by when he's\u000afinally out on parole. Great deal.After 30 years digging a tunnel with a miniature pickaxe after being\u000awrongly convicted for a crime he did not commit and stealing from the\u000acorrupt warden in the process sounds the absolute catharsis for some, I\u000athought it was sad, sad that he lost his whole life in a prison, sad\u000athat he had to put up with all that crap for so long, sad that he must\u000ahave been reintegrated after a while if somehow his story went on. Call\u000ame a pessimist, but that's not hope.I sometimes wonder what so many people saw in this movie that I was the\u000aonly one on planet earth who did not quite "get it". The only thing\u000athis movie taught me more than anything else is that democracy is not\u000aalways the best regime. What did every one suddenly see that back in\u000a1994 people did not? Maybe it's an internet this right? Internet stuff,\u000athat serious business. This strange Leviathan that transforms unknown\u000aSouth-Korean pop singers in music sensations and record-holders for\u000amost watched movie on the planet. The internet, maybe someone watched\u000ait and thought it would be funny to invent a secret message, so deep,\u000aso unworldly, so incredible and anyone who could not "see it" was\u000ainstantly deemed unworthy.That monster that drives everyone to think this average movie should be\u000aconsidered some kind of demigod due to its averageness. We see that\u000abecause we're average, enlightened beings see greatness, colossal\u000amessages within that lifts the human spirit, cleanse our souls with its\u000areach.The movie was good, and that's about it.\u000a

V\u000aWhen I watched Shawshank Redemption at first,I had been in the high\u000aschool and this film left a good impression with me, I say that I\u000alearned how to follow your passions and hopes, how to struggle to be\u000afree. And " don't never forget,hope is good something and good\u000asomethings never die " this sentence which passes in the film, I always\u000abelieve it every part of mine. Because A person lives with his or her\u000ahopes and passions so, If it is seized from people,that people lose\u000atheir aims in the life. And what the best properties of this film, It\u000ashows that hopes and passions are indispensable for people...In\u000aaddition to my review about Shawshank Redemption, Whenever I watch this\u000afilm, I learn that it puts in new things my life.

V\u000aLittle that I write here is going to add or detract from the thousands\u000aof glowing reviews already posted for this film, so just to be\u000aconsistent with the opinions of mostly everyone else and reinforce its\u000avery high rating, I'm adding my own 10/10.It's one of those films that can be watched again and again, and never\u000aget old.Yes, there are a few flaws, especially one particular continuity error.\u000aThe film spans over two decades of prison life but the clothes never\u000achange. Everyone wears the same baggy 1950's slacks and shirts\u000athroughout.I've always found it easier to find fault than give praise, but this\u000areally is a great film.

All characters lived their roles and\u000aThe best performance however, comes from Morgan Freeman as Red, suave\u000ayet very charismatic. Acting isn't just about your vocal range, it's\u000aabout depth, which was what Freeman certainly had. In short.. Awesome\u000amovie Give it a Look and u will never feel wasted . Masterpiece at its\u000abest .There is not a dull moment or poor line of dialogue in this film.\u000aCredit first time director Frank Darabont for this remarkable piece of\u000awork. I still can't believe this was his first movie!, he will find it\u000ahard to top this masterful film. Special mention must be made of the\u000amusic score by Thomas Newman, who has composed a simple, but perfect\u000ascore for this film. His scoring of the scene with Andy and Red sitting\u000aup against the wall discussing their plans for release is nothing short\u000aof brilliant, as is the rest of his score.Give it a Watch for sure .\u000a

V\u000aDon't believe anyone who says that this film is overrated. In my view,\u000ait is one of the most outstanding pieces of cinema in recent times. The reason that Shawshank is so good is that it is marvellously\u000awell-executed in several aspects. The most notable of these is the\u000aacting - Morgan Freeman is in fine form as Red, a long-serving inmate\u000awho befriends new prisoner Andy Dufresne, played by Tim Robbins.\u000aRobbins' performance left me amazed as his portrayal of Andy was so\u000arich and layered that even the most cynical viewer would struggle not\u000ato feel for him. The journey of the character, his struggles and his\u000avictories, great and small, are so deeply satisfying that you cannot\u000atear your eyes away from it. The story also has great pacing, courtesy\u000aof director Frank Darabont - it never feels hurried, nor does it drag.\u000aThe development of the friendship between Andy and Red is done\u000aparticularly well; the way it changes and grows deeper as time passes\u000a(the film spans nearly 20 years), and how you learn more about each\u000acharacter, feels natural. Darabont also perfectly captures the\u000aatmosphere of life in Shawshank prison. The script is gold, giving a\u000afantastic narrative through Red, and including some rather poignant\u000asentiments that we can all connect with on some level - mainly, Andy's\u000athoughts on hope and freedom. There is some discussion over whether The Shawshank Redemption or the\u000aGodfather is more deserving of the #1 film spot. For me, there's no\u000acontest - yes, The Godfather is a great piece of film in many ways, but\u000athe fact is that it doesn't satisfy you nearly as much as Shawshank on\u000aany level. This film feels like it matters, and by the end (without\u000atrying to sound too corny), it leaves you with a sense of sheer joy and\u000awonder that is rare in films nowadays. Well-made, outstandingly acted\u000aand deeply satisfying, this incredible film strikes a chord with us\u000aall, and deserves every bit of praise that it gets.\u000a

How they feel comfort\u000ain a place like Shawshank which I can say is a Hell in real life.

Even those jaded film fans will love "The\u000aShawshank Redemption" because it sets a new standard for films in this\u000agenre. The movie will make you emotional and sometimes sentimental take\u000aon friendship and life, even when that life is spent in a cage, and\u000awill make viewers laugh, cry, and reflect on their own lives in ways\u000athat very few movies can.

V\u000aCan Hollywood, usually creating things for entertainment purposes only,\u000acreate art? To create something of this nature, a director must\u000aapproach it in a most meticulous manner, due to the delicacy of the\u000aprocess. Such a daunting task requires an extremely capable artist with\u000aan undeniable managerial capacity and an acutely developed awareness of\u000aeach element of art in their films, the most prominent; music, visuals,\u000ascript, and acting. These elements, each equally important, must\u000asucceed independently, yet still form a harmonious union, because this\u000amixture determines the fate of the artist's opus. Though already well\u000aknown amongst his colleagues for his notable skills at writing and\u000adirecting, Frank Darabont emerges with his feature film directorial\u000adebut, The Shawshank Redemption. Proving himself already a master of\u000athe craft, Darabont managed to create one of the most recognizable\u000aindependent releases in the history of Hollywood. The Shawshank\u000aRedemption defines a genre, defies the odds, compels the emotions, and\u000abrings an era of artistically influential films back to Hollywood.The story begins with the trial of a young banker, Andy Dufrense,\u000avictimized by circumstantial evidence, resulting in a conviction for\u000athe murder of his wife and her lover. After a quick conviction, Andy\u000afinds himself serving a life sentence at Shawshank prison, with no hope\u000aof parole. He exists in this prison only in appearance, keeping his\u000amind free from the drab walls around him. His ability to do this\u000aresults in the gaining of respect from his fellow inmates, but most of\u000aall from Ellis Redding. Ellis, commonly referred to as Red, finds\u000againful use of his entrepreneurial spirit within the drab walls of\u000aShawshank by dealing in contraband and commodities rare to the confines\u000aof prison. Andy's demeanor and undeniable sense of hope causes Red to\u000atake a deeper look at himself, and the world around him. Andy proves to\u000aRed and the other inmates that in the conventional walls of Shawshank\u000aprison convention will find no home in his lifestyle.\u000a

Yes, the film might be bit\u000aoverrated, but that doesn't mean that it's not worthy of the praise it\u000ahas been getting over the years.The story is gripping and timeless and is good for multiple viewing.\u000aCinematography is beautiful and the execution of the time frame is\u000astung.The film is not without its flaws but they are so minor that they\u000aare over shadowed by how the film carries itself. Whether you like the\u000amovie or not is always subjective, but one thing is for sure The\u000aShawshank Redemption will leave an impression on you.\u000a

V\u000aThis is the best movie I've ever watched!! It told a moving story very\u000aeffectively. Former banker Andy Dusfresne is wrongly convicted for a\u000adouble murder and sent to Shawshank Prison. The first few years are a\u000astruggle but he eventually carves out for a place for himself and\u000abenefits the other inmates in the process, winning favours through\u000ahelping the guards and warden with financial planning and expanding the\u000aprison's meagre library. He becomes solid friends with Red, a black man\u000awho entered 20 years before and is highly resourceful. What resonates with the audience is Andy's clinging to hope. The\u000asaddest part was when the boy that Andy had been tutoring obtained a\u000ahigh school diploma, but shortly after, was shot dead under the\u000awarden's orders as he had knowledge that could prove Andy innocent.\u000aFollowing that, Red tells Andy that hope is a dangerous thing. Bur\u000afurther events prove that hope is in fact a good thing (as Andy tells\u000aRed in a letter) - Andy escapes through a hole he dug in his cell wall\u000a(hidden behind a large poster of a hot woman) and escapes to Mexico\u000ausing a false identity and cash that he'd procured while laundering\u000amoney for the warden. Before leaving, he submits evidence incriminating\u000athe hypocritical warden. As the cross-stitching on the warden's office\u000awall reads, judgment does indeed come! Red is released soon after and\u000astruggles to adapt to the outside the world. But for Andy's invitation\u000ato join him, Red would probably have gone down the path of Brooks, who\u000acommitted suicide.The Shawshank Redemption combined a message of hope with wonderful\u000astorytelling and attention to detail. It's truly a masterpiece.\u000a

V\u000aIt has been a pretty long time since i have seen such a great movie ,\u000agreat actors and great play of roles. Watching this movie made me\u000arealize a little evolution on movies spirit,knowing that lately film\u000acompanies are trying to put technology first. In general , the movie\u000amanaged to build a very strong emotional link between characters in the\u000afilm , and apparently , that link is strong enough to make us feel for\u000athem and share feelings with the cast.I simply love everything about\u000athis movie, beginning from Andy's first day in prison , to his last day\u000alocked.I was impressed with the details ,they were perfectly\u000ahandled,(per say) like the time when Andy tried to hit the pipes on the\u000asame time with the storm so the guards would not hear him trying to\u000aescape. Those little things matter a lot. I gave it a 10 and enjoyed\u000awatching it. Simply beautiful.\u000a

V\u000aI have never seen such an amazing film since I saw The Shawshank\u000aRedemption. What a story and screenplay. It is a simple film, yet it\u000ahas an everlasting message. Written and directed by Frank Darabont.\u000aI'll Never forget this movie in my life. The opening aerial shots of the prison are a total eye-opener. This\u000afilm manages to redeem Hollywood in the eyes of people who feared it\u000along lost in a dark sea of clichés and predictability. This movie has a foundation and just kept on being built on from their\u000aand that foundation is hope.But the one thing which makes THE SHAWSHANK\u000aREDEMPTION stand above all other films, is the attention given to the\u000astory.\u000a

V\u000aFirst things first, ill admit it. I went in to shawshank with low\u000aexpectations.I was expecting a two hour bore- fest, a type of\u000agodfather/citizen Kane film which as a film fan you MUST watch, and\u000aMUST love, and if you don't you just don't get it. But I didn't get\u000athat. Not at all.Within the first half hour, this film got more emotion out of me than\u000amost others get throughout their whole running time, all simply from a\u000a(ahem) slightly over weight man weeping, calling out for his mother,\u000aall while the other prisoners are teasing him in their cells.The first\u000aact ofthe film constantly has this dark feel to it, inserting it deep\u000ain yourmind that prison is not a nice place. Red, brilliantly played by\u000aMorganfreeman, describes andys daily attempted rapes by "the sisters".\u000aWe are shown a recently set free prisoner killing himself. This first\u000aact is hard to watch. Not as in boring, or gory. In fact, I found some\u000aof the scenes in this part harder to watch than I found saw. But get\u000athrough the first act, it sets you up for a second act. A second act of\u000ahope. A second act of friendship. A second act of humour. And for the\u000aleads, a second act if redemption. The two slowly, through general\u000adecency, start to become better people then they were on the outside (\u000aalbeit, one getting institutionalised(watch the film or get a\u000adictionary)). To say best film is a bold statement as a film fan, on the Internet, in\u000aa world that has gems such as the godfather, apocalypse now, citizen\u000aKane, goodfellas, Casablanca, the list goes on and on. But what this\u000afilm does more so than the others is make you feel something, deep down\u000ainside of you. A feeling that will stay with you days after you watch\u000ait.\u000a

V\u000aI saw this film when I was fourteen, and at the time it was the most\u000aflawlessly impressive piece of storytelling I had ever seen. If I were\u000aforced to make a top 10 list this movie would certainly be right up\u000athere. Robbins and Freeman are both incredible, and as good as they are\u000ain other films I would still say it remains their finest work. The\u000ascenery and costumes, the prison which if I remember right was an\u000aactual prison back around the same time the film took place. It is all\u000aso rich with texture and detail that it draws you in. The story is\u000agreat, Stephen King has written some amazing stories and this is a\u000atestament that he is not just a horror novel expert. The actors all\u000atake it to the next level and make it a pretty much perfect film. It is\u000apretentious to say a film or any piece of art is perfect, however I\u000ahonestly can't say there is anything I dislike about the film. No scene\u000aseems long and unnecessary, every actor is perfectly cast and feels\u000avery authentic. It really is the real deal. Like American History X and\u000asome other films it is a movie that everyone with a moderately high IQ\u000aand a love of cinema should see one day.\u000a

V\u000aA good fast paced movie. Not your typical prison movie. Tim Robbins has\u000aa cool demeanor and Morgan Freeman does a great job in his supporting\u000arole as well as narrating the film. Kudos also to the warden and his\u000asadistic enforcer. This movie has a lot more character development and\u000adepth than your typical prison movie. It can be slightly depressing at\u000atimes but what drama isn't? I'm not even the drama type and even I\u000aliked this movie. This movie does a great job of evoking feelings of\u000afear, anger, excitement, sadness, hope and inspiration. This film isn't\u000afor the faint of heart. The music score contributes greatly to the\u000afilm. A must- see for drama lovers.\u000a

V\u000aThis is probably my favorite movie of all time. It lacks intense\u000agraphics and sex appeal, and more modern day traits that interest me.\u000aHowever, when someone asks me what my favorite movie is; I always have\u000ato say Shawshank redemption. Morgan Freeman is an amazing actor that\u000ahas proved to be able to grow through the years. The plot is one that\u000aappeals to nearly every person on the face of the earth. It's an\u000aextreme underdog story, a simple man gets his revenge movie, and it's\u000awholesome. Nothing more could be asked of this story. Everyone has had\u000anightmares of being "locked up" for something they didn't do, and this\u000aalso appeals to that emotion.\u000a

V\u000aI will never forget how I was introduced to this film. My very abstract\u000athinking gypsy of a cousin was visiting our home and as we began\u000atalking about films made mention of this one. She followed with the\u000atraditional line of, "What!?! You have not seen that movie? Oh my God,\u000ait's the GREATEST!". With reluctance(really....to be honest we just did\u000anot want to be rude!), we all agreed to watch. What transpired over the\u000anext 2+ hours was the greatest movie I have ever seen. This movie\u000acovers every spectrum of the human existence possible. Death, life,\u000aheartache, love, friendship, betrayal, injustice and of course justice\u000ajust to name a few. The entire movie is a roller coaster of the human\u000acondition and the end will leave you bathing in tears and triumph. I\u000ahave seen so many movies both old and new in my life but this one is\u000ajust above them all. The last 20 minutes alone are worth the price of\u000aadmission.....A must watch for everyone.\u000a

V\u000aWhy do I want to write the 999th comment on The Shawshank Redemption? I\u000aam not sure - almost everything that could be possibly said about it\u000ahas been said. But like so many other people who wrote comments, I was\u000aand am profoundly moved by this simple and eloquent depiction of hope\u000aand friendship and redemption. The only other movie I have ever seen that effects me as strongly is To\u000aKill a Mockingbird. Both movies leave me feeling cleaner for having\u000awatched them.I didn't intend to see this movie at all: I do not like prison movies\u000aand I don't normally watch them. I work at a branch library and one day\u000aas I was checking The Shawshank Redemption out to one of our older\u000apatrons, she said to me, "Whenever I feel down or depressed, I check\u000aout this movie and watch it and it always makes me feel better." At the\u000atime, I thought that was very strange. One day there was nothing on TV\u000aexcept things I absolutely would not watch under any circumstance or\u000athings that I had seen too many times already. I remembered what she\u000asaid, so I watched it. I have watched it many many times since then and\u000ait gets better with every showing.No action, no special effects - just men in prison uniforms talking to\u000aeach other.The Shawshank Redemption and To Kill a Mockingbird are the best movies\u000aI have ever seen. I do not judge it by it's technical merits - I don't\u000areally care about that. I have read that Citizen Kane or The Godfather\u000aor this or that movie is the best movie ever made. They may have the\u000abest technique or be the most influential motion pictures ever made,\u000abut not the best. The best movies are ones that touch the soul. It\u000atakes a movie like The Shawshank Redemption to touch the soul.\u000a

Adapted from the Stephen King novella Rita Hayworth and\u000aShawshank Redemption, the film tells the story of Andy Dufresne, a\u000abanker who spends nearly two decades in Shawshank State Prison for the\u000amurder of his wife and her lover despite his claims of innocence.\u000aDuring his time at the prison, he befriends a fellow inmate, Ellis Boyd\u000a"Red" Redding, and finds himself protected by the guards after the\u000awarden begins using him in his money laundering operation.In 1947,\u000abanker Andy Dufresne (Tim Robbins) is convicted of murdering his wife\u000aand her lover, based on circumstantial evidence, and is sentenced to\u000atwo consecutive life sentences at Shawshank State Penitentiary. Andy\u000aquickly befriends contraband smuggler Ellis "Red" Redding (Morgan\u000aFreeman), an inmate serving a life sentence. Red procures a rock hammer\u000afor Andy, allowing him to create small stone chess pieces. Red later\u000agets him a large poster of Rita Hayworth, followed in later years by\u000aimages of Marilyn Monroe and Raquel Welch. Andy works in the prison\u000alaundry, but is regularly assaulted by the "bull queer" gang "the\u000aSisters" and their leader Bogs (Mark Rolston). In 1949, Andy overhears\u000athe brutal chief guard Byron Hadley (Clancy Brown) complaining about\u000ataxes on a forthcoming inheritance and informs him about a financial\u000aloophole. After another vicious assault by the Sisters nearly kills\u000aAndy, Hadley severely beats Bogs resulting in Bogs being sent to\u000aanother prison. Andy is not attacked again. Warden Samuel Norton (Bob\u000aGunton) meets with Andy and reassigns him to the prison library to\u000aassist elderly inmate Brooks Hatlen (James Whitmore), a pretext for\u000aAndy to manage financial duties for the prison. His advice and\u000aexpertise are soon sought by other guards at Shawshank and from nearby\u000aprisons. Andy begins writing weekly letters to the state government for\u000afunds to improve the decrepit library. In 1954, Brooks is freed on\u000aparole, but unable to adjust to the outside world after 50 years in\u000aprison, he hangs himself. Andy receives a library donation that\u000aincludes a recording of The Marriage of Figaro. He plays an excerpt\u000aover the public address system, resulting in his receiving solitary\u000aconfinement. After his release, Andy explains that he holds onto hope\u000aas something that the prison cannot take from him, but Red dismisses\u000athe idea. In 1963, Norton begins exploiting prison labor for public\u000aworks, profiting by undercutting skilled labor costs and receiving\u000akickbacks. He has Andy launder the money using the alias "Randall\u000aStephens". In 1965, Tommy Williams (Gil Bellows) is incarcerated for\u000aburglary. He joins Andy's and Red's circle of friends, and Andy helps\u000ahim pass his General Educational Development (G.E.D.) examinations. In\u000a1966, after hearing the details of Andy's case, Tommy reveals that an\u000ainmate at another prison claimed responsibility for an identical\u000amurder, suggesting Andy's innocence. Andy approaches Norton with this\u000ainformation, but the warden refuses to listen. Norton places Andy in\u000asolitary confinement and has Hadley murder Tommy, under the guise of an\u000aescape attempt. Andy refuses to continue with the scam, but Norton\u000athreatens to destroy the library and take away his protection and\u000apreferential treatment. After Andy is released from solitary\u000aconfinement, he tells Red of his dream of living in Zihuatanejo, a\u000aMexican Pacific coastal town. While Red shrugs it off as being\u000aunrealistic, Andy instructs him, should he ever be freed, to visit a\u000aspecific hayfield near Buxton to retrieve a package. The next day at\u000aroll call, upon finding Andy's cell empty, an irate Norton throws one\u000aof Andy's rocks at the poster of Raquel Welch hanging on the wall. The\u000arock tears through the poster, revealing a tunnel that Andy had dug\u000awith his rock hammer over the previous two decades. The previous night,\u000aAndy escaped through the tunnel and the prison's sewage pipe with\u000aNorton's ledger, containing details of the money laundering. While\u000aguards search for him the following morning, Andy, posing as Randall\u000aStephens, visits several banks to withdraw the laundered money.\u000aFinally, he sends the ledger and evidence of the corruption and murders\u000aat Shawshank to a local newspaper. The police arrive at Shawshank and\u000atake Hadley into custody, while Norton commits suicide to avoid arrest.\u000aAfter serving 40 years, Red receives parole. He struggles to adapt to\u000alife outside prison and fears he never will. Remembering his promise to\u000aAndy, he visits Buxton and finds a cache containing money and a letter\u000aasking him to come to Zihuatanejo. Red violates his parole and travels\u000ato Fort Hancock, Texas to cross the border to Mexico, admitting he\u000afinally feels hope. On a beach in Zihuatanejo, he finds Andy, and the\u000atwo friends are happily reunited.\u000a

V\u000aThe Shawshank Redemption is my favorite movie of all time. I love the\u000astory and the cast and settings of the movie. I have seen the movie\u000amany times, and each time I enjoy it more and more. I love Stephen\u000aKing's original story, and the way the movie script sticks closely to\u000athis. All of the characters shine, especially Andy and Red. The message\u000aof hope in the story has kept me strong over the years.I have a big question. In the "facts" list the music which Andy\u000aDufresne (Tim Robbins) plays over the P.A. system with the door to the\u000awarden's office locked -- it says the music is "Duettino Sull'Aria or\u000aSull'aria the Soave Zeffaretto from the Marriage of Figaro by Mozart.\u000aThis is not true. The ORIGINAL music Andy plays is THE FLOWER DUET from\u000athe opera LAKME by Debiles!!! MY QUESTION IS IF this is the original\u000amusic...why and when was there a change in this music?. The Flower Duet\u000ais indeed the most inspiring and beautiful music ever composed and fits\u000avery well with the stunning remarks in Morgan Freeman's\u000aThought/monologue. MY QUESTION IS what music is written in the book, if\u000ait is or was it the choice of the director. or writer? Does anyone have\u000athe actual book??? I emailed Rich Caparella of the classic station KUSC\u000asince he planned to play THE FLOWER DUET on his program and he replied\u000athat he found it quite interesting and assumed the problem was\u000aconcerning rights and contracts to play the music. But why the\u000acover-up??? I will not rest till I find out the truth about this,\u000abecause it kind of ruins the whole movie if that music has been\u000achanged. The duet by Mozart is not inspiring AT ALL really compared to\u000aThe Flower Duet, likely the most beautiful music ever composed. Simon\u000aWilby simonwilby.com\u000a

V\u000awhen i saw top movie ranking i found this one but my point of view is\u000athis this movie is good but also made a hope for jail broken theme\u000a..this is also not a good over all good example for best hope .... :).\u000aOVERALL SCORE: 9.8/10 = A+ The Shawshank Redemption served as a message\u000aof hope to Hollywood as well. More than any film in memory, it proved\u000athere is life after box office. Besting Forrest and Fiction, it ran\u000asolely on strong word of mouth and became the hottest rented film of\u000a1995. It currently sits at #2 in the IMDb's Top 250 Films, occasionally\u000aswapping spots with The Godfather as the top ranked film of all time --\u000aredemption indeed. If you haven't seen it yet, what the hell are you\u000awaiting for? As Andy says, "It comes down a simple choice, really.\u000aEither get busy living, or get busy dying."\u000a

V\u000aI read the short story by Stephen King and I absolutely loved it! This\u000amovie really pays tribute to both the writer and the story! There are\u000asome minor differences but they are an improvement to the screen. I think just like M. Night Shyamalan is not just 'the master of\u000asuspense and plot twists', Stephen King is not just a horror and\u000amystery genius. I think, in the end, all his stories (even the most\u000adark and gloomy and disturbing) are about HOPE. This movie really shows\u000athat! The story is not just about redemption but about friendship and hope. I really recommend it! I think this is the best screen adaptation of a\u000aStephen King novel / short story and that includes The Shining.They only minor thing I would have changed about the movie is, if I\u000ahave to nitpick, loose the 'THE'. I think "SHAWSHANK REDEMPTION" would\u000ahave been a more powerful title.\u000a

V\u000aQuestion arose when I saw a movie with that high rating in IMDb. After\u000afinally found this movie and saw it by myself, I can say that the\u000arating shows everything: this is one of a top movie you should watch\u000abefore you die. No matter that Shawshank was defeated in all its\u000anominations of Academy Award 1994: number of award is not always a\u000acorrect guideline to tell you whether a movie is good or not.The theme is just simple, if we compare with 2000s movies: mainly talks\u000aabout friendship and hope. In this almost-100-percent-male-actors film,\u000athere is no special sound effect, science-fiction complicated visual\u000aeffect, super make-up on actors/actresses, just the story and dialogs.\u000aBut the theme is so unique, can say this is a signature film about\u000aprison; and the message it brings will stay forever after you finished\u000awatching, so that you'll never forget. That's why I gave a 10: I was\u000areally surprised/shocked about this movie's ending, and even tried to\u000awatch it again about 2-3 times!Still re-think to watch this movie? Trust me, you'll not disappointed.\u000aAnd one more thing: don't compare it to Forrest Gump. Both of these\u000amovies have distinct special messages themselves, both are good, both\u000aare unique. And after that you'll be able to talk to everyone about the\u000amessage Shawshank brings.\u000a

V\u000athis is by far one of my favorite movies! Not only just because of\u000amorgan Freeman sexy voice, but because of the flawless acting and\u000aconnection to the characters in the movie! If you're looking for a\u000amovie with a great story line, then i will very much recommend this\u000amovie. the pros of this movie is that it has well known and great actors in\u000ait, a great storyline stretching over several dozen years.the cons can be that it is long, but for many people (like me) then\u000athat can be a very good thing! i just thought i might as well add\u000asomething to the cons, so the movie seems more human, because this is a\u000amovie where there's just nothing that you would wish to change. another\u000acon would be that there's not too much action going on in it witch\u000athere is a few people who likes.\u000a

V\u000aA day full of thoughts after you watch this and the remarkable feeling\u000ahow you make a movie like this. Time is totally worth it. Don't expect\u000ait as a random prison story. Plain and simple.No action and effects.\u000aThe truth to ultimate reality. No goofs as there's an explanation to\u000aevery scene. I think every actor in the movie gave their best\u000aperformances. Just awesome. Sad feeling all around but ending is\u000aawesome.Character Andy comes out to be cooler than you think he is and\u000ashows everyone this isn't it and you might think and which i thought to\u000abe so straight forward was his lucky cell location...which can\u000acertainly be overlooked because after this is what he deserved as he\u000awas innocent!\u000a

V\u000aGoing to prison is never easy and almost an unimaginable experience for\u000amost people. It's even worse if you are sentenced for fifty years\u000adespite being innocent. Shawshank Redemption is an incredible movie. Not only because of its\u000afantastic narration and storytelling technique. Not only because of the\u000aemotional yet inspirational performances put on by each and every\u000aactor/actress. Not even the spectacular filming and perfect settings.\u000aNo, what makes Shawshank Redemption a truly excellent film is the\u000acomplete story and the very relatable tale that is the life of Andy\u000aDufresne.This movie focuses on the lives of minor characters, life in and out of\u000aprison, and how the system has changed so many men and women\u000adrastically. And it's these individual stories that make Andy's even\u000amore special. He was able to stay strong, to manage without friends or\u000asupport in the worst times. He was a man no one would have looked at\u000atwice. No one special. Just another person like you and me. Yet, his\u000astory is one that we can all imagine ourselves in. Where bad\u000acircumstances meet inexplicable motives, and it's being capable of\u000aimagining ourselves in Andy's shoes that makes Shawshank Redemption\u000asuch a beautiful movie.This movie stands for a lot of things. Love, respect, peace and\u000afriendship among other things. More so than the rest, Shawshank\u000aRedemption is a story about hope. Having faith in the future, secretly\u000aknowing good will overcome bad.No one knows what our future holds. But if we could all live like Andy,\u000aoptimistic and ever so kind in the most dire of situations, holding up\u000atrue justice, this world would be a better place.\u000a

V\u000aOne Of the best movies I have seen The script was well written. The\u000acharacters played there parts well & were well suited for there picked\u000arolls. A well-educated banker imprisoned for the murder of his wife and\u000aher lover, can do just as much damage inside prison as outside working\u000ain a BANK!In 1947, banker Andy Dufresne (Tim Robbins) is convicted of murdering\u000ahis wife and her lover, based on circumstantial evidence, and is\u000asentenced to two consecutive life sentences at Shawshank State\u000aPenitentiary. Andy quickly befriends contraband smuggler Ellis "Red"\u000aRedding (Morgan Freeman), an inmate serving a life sentence. Red\u000aprocures a rock hammer for Andy, allowing him to create small stone\u000achess pieces. Red later gets him a large poster of Rita Hayworth,\u000afollowed in later years by images of Marilyn Monroe and Raquel Welch.\u000aAndy works in the prison laundry, but is regularly assaulted by the\u000a"bull queer" gang "the Sisters" and their leader Bogs (Mark Rolston).In 1949, Andy overhears the brutal chief guard Byron Hadley (Clancy\u000aBrown) complaining about taxes on a forthcoming inheritance and informs\u000ahim about a financial loophole. After another vicious assault by the\u000aSisters nearly kills Andy, Hadley severely beats Bogs resulting in Bogs\u000abeing sent to another prison. Andy is not attacked again. Warden Samuel\u000aNorton (Bob Gunton) meets with Andy and reassigns him to the prison\u000alibrary to assist elderly inmate Brooks Hatlen (James Whitmore), a\u000apretext for Andy to manage financial duties for the prison. His advice\u000aand expertise are soon sought by other guards at Shawshank and from\u000anearby prisons. Andy begins writing weekly letters to the state\u000agovernment for funds to improve the decrepit library.In 1954, Brooks is freed on parole but, unable to adjust to the outside\u000aworld after 50 years in prison, he hangs himself. Andy receives a\u000alibrary donation that includes a recording of The Marriage of Figaro.\u000aHe plays an excerpt over the public address system, resulting in his\u000areceiving solitary confinement. After his release, Andy explains that\u000ahe holds onto hope as something that the prison cannot take from him,\u000abut Red dismisses the idea. In 1963, Norton begins exploiting prison\u000alabor for public works, profiting by undercutting skilled labor costs\u000aand receiving kickbacks. He has Andy launder the money using the alias\u000a"Randall Stephens".In 1965, Tommy Williams (Gil Bellows) is incarcerated for burglary. He\u000ajoins Andy's and Red's circle of friends, and Andy helps him pass his\u000aGeneral Educational Development (G.E.D.) examinations. In 1966, after\u000ahearing the details of Andy's case, Tommy reveals that an inmate at\u000aanother prison claimed responsibility for an identical murder,\u000asuggesting Andy's innocence. Andy approaches Norton with this\u000ainformation, but the warden refuses to listen. Norton places Andy in\u000asolitary confinement and has Hadley murder Tommy, under the guise of an\u000aescape attempt. Andy refuses to continue with the scam, but Norton\u000athreatens to destroy the library and take away his protection and\u000apreferential treatment. After Andy is released from solitary\u000aconfinement, he tells Red of his dream of living in Zihuatanejo, a\u000aMexican Pacific coastal town. While Red shrugs it off as being\u000aunrealistic, Andy instructs him, should he ever be freed, to visit a\u000aspecific hayfield near Buxton to retrieve a package.The next day at roll call, upon finding Andy's cell empty, an irate\u000aNorton throws one of Andy's rocks at the poster of Raquel Welch hanging\u000aon the wall. The rock tears through the poster, revealing a tunnel that\u000aAndy had dug with his rock hammer over the previous two decades. The\u000aprevious night, Andy escaped through the tunnel and the prison's sewage\u000apipe with Norton's ledger, containing details of the money laundering.\u000aWhile guards search for him the following morning, Andy, posing as\u000aRandall Stephens, visits several banks to withdraw the laundered money.\u000aFinally, he sends the ledger and evidence of the corruption and murders\u000aat Shawshank to a local newspaper. The police arrive at Shawshank and\u000atake Hadley into custody, while Norton commits suicide to avoid arrest.After serving 40 years, Red receives parole. He struggles to adapt to\u000alife outside prison and fears he never will. Remembering his promise to\u000aAndy, he visits Buxton and finds a cache containing money and a letter\u000aasking him to come to Zihuatanejo. Red violates his parole and travels\u000ato Fort Hancock, Texas to cross the border to Mexico, admitting he\u000afinally feels hope. On a beach in Zihuatanejo, he finds Andy, and the\u000atwo friends are happily reunited.\u000a

V\u000aThe Shawshank Redemption The Shawshank redemption is a film that takes\u000aplace in the 1940s. Andy Dufresne, which is played by Tim Robins, is a\u000aknown banker located in Maine. He was sent to prison with two life\u000asentences, for the murder of his wife and her lover. Andy Dufrense\u000amaintains his innocence throughout the film. Andy serves as the main\u000acharacter for the film. Ellis Redding, which is played by Morgan\u000aFreeman and goes by the nickname red, is known as the go to guy. When\u000aAndy arrives to the prison, Red places a bet with the other inmates\u000athat Andy would be the one to break down first, out of all the inmates\u000athat arrived with Andy on the bus. Andy gains knowledge of Red's\u000acapability to obtain contraband and approaches with an order. From then\u000aon, Andy and Red become inseparable for the duration of the film. There\u000aare many themes employed in the film, but I believe the most\u000asignificant theme is "hope". Andy continues to maintain his innocence\u000aeven after his conviction and hopes he will one day be released. Red\u000aand Andy talk about future plans that they hope will one day come true,\u000aonce they are released from prison. Andy begins working in the laundry\u000aroom and is seen as fresh meat to a group known as the sisters. The\u000asisters are a known group of inmates that pick out weak inmates to\u000aabuse and rape. The sisters begin to rape and beat Andy shortly after\u000athey encounter the opportunity. The abuse and rape continues on for\u000aseveral years, until Andy gets picked to repair the prisons roof. This\u000agave Andy a sigh of hope that there is an escape path. He was able to\u000aescape the abuse that he endured from the sisters, so he believed he\u000awould be able to escape prison all together. The lighting in the film\u000aestablishes great lighting effects. The director utilizes low-key\u000alighting for the scenes in the prison. The low-key lighting creates a\u000agloomy dreadful feel to the scenes. This lighting was chosen by the\u000adirector to give the prison scenes an intense dramatic feel. High-key\u000alighting was utilized for the outdoor scenes, which employed a feeling\u000aof happiness and hope. This intrigued Andy to want to escape prison and\u000ahelped him make a final decision, which was to escape prison once his\u000atunnel was finished. Hope kept Andy going and kept him striving to\u000asurvive. Even when he endured the most severe hardships, he never lost\u000ahope to one day escape his pain. Overall the film was a magnificent\u000aproduction. The movie received several Academy awards including,\u000aAmerican Society of Cinematographers Award for Outstanding Achievement\u000ain Cinematography in Theatrical Releases and Japan Academy Prize for\u000aOutstanding Foreign Language Film. The film did not receive much profit\u000awhile in theaters, but has received promising reviews from critics.\u000a

V\u000a'Get busy livin' or get busy dyin', that's damn right'.A stand-out performance from the magnificent movie maestro Morgan\u000aFreeman, whom leads this spectacular motion picture with fantastic\u000astyle as the enigmatic convict known as Red, earning himself a well\u000adeserved Academy Award nomination. Tim Robbins plays our main\u000aprotagonist, Andy Dufresne, an innocent banker charged with the murder\u000aof his wife, a crime he did not commit. The film chronicles Dufresne's\u000atime in Shawshank Penetentiary, from the first day meeting the\u000a'more-than welcome' guards, to dirty deals with corrupt Warden Sharp\u000a(played by a superb Bob Gunton), to befriending characters like Red and\u000aBrooks, a 70-something long-sentence server acting as librarian (played\u000aby James Whitmore, in one of his later roles) and to the momentous\u000abreak-out, symbolising everything this film stands for: hope. Shawshank is the perfect movie, great story, great actors and a great\u000adirector. The culmination of captivating music and scintillating\u000aatmosphere transform this movie into something more: a legend. I would thoroughly recommend this film to anyone, it is a must watch.\u000a

V\u000aEveryone has those 'great films' that everyone seems to love and go on\u000aabout yet they have not seen them themselves, top of the IMDb ratings\u000alist and talked about by many of my friends  for me 'The Shawshank\u000aRedemption' was one of those films. The film follows the tale of two\u000amen together in Shawshank Prison, Andy Dufresne (Tim Robbins) and 'Red'\u000a(Morgan Freeman). The film is a narrative of Andy's life in prison,\u000atold through the eyes of Red, a man who has spent almost his whole life\u000athere.The tale that is told is as the film's title suggests, one of\u000aredemption as well as the development of friendship between Andy and\u000aRed. The film's tale of redemption is a relatively simple one to follow\u000aalthough it is how this tale is told that makes the film so powerful to\u000athe viewer. Each scene feels compelling and powerful, each treated with\u000athe same respect, with great detail and emotional depth with almost\u000aevery sub-plot explored, the acting is brilliant and the viewer feels\u000aexactly what Andy has to suffer.Throughout the film we become accustomed to prison life, the brutal\u000atreatment from the warden and the officers, the harsh life that becomes\u000ainevitable to Andy who accepts he will be beaten and taken advantage\u000aof. Despite the harsh realities of prison life Andy seems to take\u000abattle on, living a happy life at terms with what he now accepts\u000adespite insisting his innocence, he makes the most of life happily\u000ahelping out those around him and willingly taking on board huge\u000aprojects for himself such as the warden's (Bob Gunton) financial work,\u000athe prison library and the education of a young prisoner Tommy (Gil\u000aBellows).The film is shown powerfully through emotional development through the\u000acharacters and the great attention paid to its scenes, and unlike\u000aothers which you see filled with fast-paced scenes and computer\u000aeffects, the focus is not on that but instead the message that is\u000adisplayed through the great work of Frank Darabont. It's the touching\u000aeffect that the film has on the viewer that sees it held in such high\u000aregard by the majority and see it top film lists such as 'IMDB's Top\u000a250'. The adaptation is brilliant and Darabont gives us a great\u000aportrayal of the harsh prison life that is shown accurately through\u000awell-paced scenes and perfect acting.The film's 'twist' is great, and acts as an explanation as to Andy's\u000abehaviour inside the prison, how he has come to accept and is willing\u000ato live the harsh prison life despite protesting his innocence knowing\u000athat he'll have to endure the torture if he wants to come out as\u000aplanned. But the film is not just your typical fairytale or happy\u000aprison escape, although redemptions are completed it is shown that life\u000aoutside is not everything you may expect and that itself can be harsh,\u000auncertain and challenging. This is shown through James Whitmore's\u000afantastic performance as Brooks Hatlen, a man who has become so\u000aaccustomed to prison life that he finds himself unable to cope with the\u000aoutside world.The Shawshank Redemption failed to win a single Oscar after being\u000anominated for seven, with it being in competition to other great films\u000asuch as Pulp Fiction and Forrest Gump. I personally regard Pulp Fiction\u000aas one of my favourite films and almost everyone loves Forest Gump like\u000amany others but The Shawshank Redemption is different, it has been more\u000asuccessful after release following initial failure at box office and I\u000athink that's because the story appeals to everyone, like I've said it's\u000apowerful, compelling and it has seems to effect everyone with its warm\u000aand heart-touching story, it has grown based on its affect on people\u000awho will discuss and recommend it to others.Is The Shawshank Redemption the best film of all time? Probably not,\u000abut that certainly doesn't mean it's undeserving of the high praise it\u000areceives. A masterpiece for what it intends to be, an emotional and\u000acompelling tale that is told in a beautiful way that you'll struggle to\u000afind in many other films. This film is one that appeals to many for\u000agood reason and if you're one of those people who haven't seen the film\u000ayet, then I certainly recommend you do.\u000a

V\u000aThe movie starts bit slow, but right from the start you will feel that\u000ayou are into it. Every moment your mind will be wondering what will\u000ahappen next cos you never know. The director has made great effort to\u000amake it like that. There are very few good movies that defines "Hope".\u000aBut non can challenge this one. The movie shows how good can happen\u000aeven in the worst, and to never loss hope. Morgan Freeman is another\u000amaster piece in this movie. Both his acting and narration touches our\u000aheart. There are some extreme scenes in the movie that shows the\u000areality to what happens in a Prison. How people tend to behave during\u000athe initial period and how they transform it to a routine that is to be\u000afollowed every single day. I am really great full that i saw this movie\u000aand found a crucial part to believe in. If you are looking for a good\u000aclassical movie that has drama, suspense and a message than this will\u000abe the best movies you will ever watch. If you are looking for a action\u000amovie and hungry for blood then this is not for you.\u000a

V\u000aParagraphically, at First, when I see the film, some Centinal stuffs\u000awasn't pull out. Due to many problems and unresolved conflicts, I see\u000ait as a dump. But when I see it the second time, I understand what it\u000ais about, and how it came to be the greatest drama of all time. It\u000abenefits from a strong cast, feeling that Tim Robbins and Morgan\u000aFreeman did the film themselves. They devoted to the film all they got.\u000aFrom expression, to heavy feelings. They look us in the eye, and\u000aexpresses their demand for freedom and a life of a normal man. The film\u000adrives us from jail to out, resulting some hard to be fitted in like\u000aBrooks. It's an unique way, seeing the prisoners dealing with their\u000alife afterward, not like any other films. It has a great script, a set\u000ascene full of masterpiece coming to life after 20 years of finding it's\u000aown success. It stepped out, starting as a bomb, but ended as a real\u000alife and day with surviving and breakthrough hearted mean with the\u000aShawshank Prison\u000a

V\u000aI think this movie is very meaningful. I like it very much. You must\u000athink so too. You must all have a lot to say. But according to what we\u000ahave appointed, Im the Chair, so please let me show you my opinion\u000afirst. The story begins with the trial of a young banker, Andy\u000aDufrense, victimized by circumstantial evidence, resulting in a\u000aconviction for the murder of his wife and her lover. After a quick\u000aconviction, Andy finds himself serving a life sentence at Shawshank\u000aprison, with no hope of parole. He exists in this prison only in\u000aappearance, keeping his mind free from the drab walls around him. His\u000aability to do this results in the gaining of respect from his fellow\u000ainmates, but most of all from Ellis Redding. Ellis, commonly referred\u000ato as Red, finds gainful use of his entrepreneurial spirit within the\u000adrab walls of Shawshank by dealing in contraband and commodities rare\u000ato the confines of prison. Andy\u005c's demeanor and undeniable sense of\u000ahope causes Red to take a deeper look at himself, and the world around\u000ahim. Andy proves to Red and the other inmates that in the conventional\u000awalls of Shawshank prison convention will find no home in his\u000alifestyle. As far as Im concerned, this movie shows us three things:\u000afreedom, friendship, and hope. If we take a movie as a novel, then\u000aShawshank Redemption is a great novel without doubt. It reflects the\u000areal social life, and creates several typical characters with Classic\u000aQuotes and a few kinds of modifications. This movie organizes the main\u000ascenario of the story in a simple way and at the same time using some\u000apetty lines. It expresses the subject in a very artistic way. There\u000awere three words, the first is freedom. However, what impressed me is\u000anearly everyone in the prison got accustomed to the prison life. Whats\u000amore, an old man even suicide after he was set free. I have a very deep\u000afeeling of friendship. The second word accrued to me is friendship.\u000aFriendship is a necessary in our life. In this movie, the friendship\u000abetween Andy and Red moved me. It gave me an idea: getting a real\u000afriendship is more important than money and power. Friendship is really\u000aimportant, and in my opinion, it is very hard to get a real friendship.\u000aWhen we don't have a real friend, we will feel very lonely. I may have\u000athis feeling during these days. That is really incredibly hard. Also\u000athere are some sentences in the movie that really impressed me. The\u000asentence I like most is hope is a good thing, maybe the best of things,\u000aand no good thing ever dies. Because I think, it encourages people\u000aappreciate the beauty of life, to keep their hope in heart forever. It\u000awas as if some beautiful birds had flapped into our drab little cage\u000aand made these walls dissolve away, and for the briefest of moments,\u000aevery last man in Shawshank felt free. From this sentence, I start to\u000aknow that, in fact, something cannot be noticed at all. That is like\u000athe freedom of our heart. We need it, just like you have never\u000aforgotten it. Another one is: Fear can hold you prisoner. Hope can set\u000ayou free. A strong man can save himself. A great man can save another.\u000aI like this sentence because it teaches me to let me full of courage\u000aand hopes. It urges me to have the determination to succeed. In the\u000aend, I want to use a sentence to summarize this movie: Fear can hold\u000ayou prisoner. Hope can set you free.\u000a

V\u000aThis is my first review on IMDb, and about the number one movie on the\u000aTOP 250 because it deserves his title and there are people that think\u000athat it didn't.The movie tells about a man that is made prisoner because of a crime he\u000aclaim he didn't committed and spend his days dreaming about freedom and\u000ajustice. The movies shows the bad things that happened to him on prison\u000aand how hope makes him believe that he still can have his freedom, even\u000awhen things are pretty bad to him.And thats why this movie makes people fell better and makes we have\u000ahope on ours own lives, because even when the things are really bad and\u000ayou (thinks) you have lost hope, there still hope, never give up of\u000ayour dreams and always believe that justice can be made! Like said by\u000aPittacus Lore in I Am Number Four: "When you have lost hope, you have\u000alost everything. And when you think all is lost, when all is dire and\u000ableak, there is always hope." and that is the reason because this movie\u000ais on IMDb TOP, when we finish watching this movie your state of mind\u000ais so good that we had the power to change our lives and believes that\u000aeverything is possible! That's the difference to the other movies, it\u000ais not only entertainment with a great movie, but also can be a change\u000aof perspective of life!\u000a

V\u000aI absolutely loved this movie. It's very heart warming and is full of\u000aemotion. I loved it so much i even went to one of the prisons that the\u000amovie took place in. Mansfield Ohio Reformatory. I recommend this movie\u000ato anyone who likes Morgan Freeman and puzzle solving films. It is also\u000aand inspirational film to look up on because of the story line and all\u000athe different angles and what not. If you ever want to go to the prison\u000ain Mansfield.. The scene where Mr. Brooks hangs himself in his apt and\u000acarves his name was also shot in that very prison. I also must say that\u000athis film brought me into tears of sadness and joy. The director was\u000areally good at capturing the emotions for the viewers.\u000a

V\u000a"The Shawshank Redemption" is a movie about time, patience and loyalty\u000a-- not sexy qualities, perhaps, but they grow on you during the\u000asubterranean progress of this story, which is about how two men serving\u000alife sentences in prison become friends and find a way to fight off\u000adespair.The story is narrated by "Red" Redding (Morgan Freeman), who has been\u000ainside the walls of Shawshank Prison for a very long time and is its\u000aleading entrepreneur. He can get you whatever you need: cigarettes,\u000acandy, even a little rock pick like an amateur geologist might use. One\u000aday he and his fellow inmates watch the latest busload of prisoners\u000aunload, and they make bets on who will cry during their first night in\u000aprison, and who will not. Red bets on a tall, lanky guy named Andy\u000aDufresne (Tim Robbins), who looks like a babe in the woods.But Andy does not cry, and Red loses the cigarettes he wagered. Andy\u000aturns out to be a surprise to everyone in Shawshank, because within him\u000ais such a powerful reservoir of determination and strength that nothing\u000aseems to break him. Andy was a banker on the outside, and he's in for\u000amurder. He's apparently innocent, and there are all sorts of details\u000ainvolving his case, but after a while they take on a kind of unreality;\u000aall that counts inside prison is its own society -- who is strong, who\u000ais not -- and the measured passage of time.Red is also a lifer. From time to time, measuring the decades, he goes\u000aup in front of the parole board, and they measure the length of his\u000aterm (20 years, 30 years) and ask him if he thinks he has been\u000arehabilitated. Oh, most surely, yes, he replies; but the fire goes out\u000aof his assurances as the years march past, and there is the sense that\u000ahe has been institutionalized -- that, like another old lifer who kills\u000ahimself after being paroled, he can no longer really envision life on\u000athe outside.Red's narration of the story allows him to speak for all of the\u000aprisoners, who sense a fortitude and integrity in Andy that survives\u000athe years. Andy will not kiss butt. He will not back down. But he is\u000anot violent, just formidably sure of himself. For the warden (Bob\u000aGunton), he is both a challenge and a resource; Andy knows all about\u000abookkeeping and tax preparation, and before long he's been moved out of\u000ahis prison job in the library and assigned to the warden's office,\u000awhere he sits behind an adding machine and keeps tabs on the warden's\u000aill-gotten gains. His fame spreads, and eventually he's doing the taxes\u000aand pension plans for most of the officials of the local prison system.There are key moments in the film, as when Andy uses his clout to get\u000asome cold beers for his friends who are working on a roofing job. Or\u000awhen he befriends the old prison librarian (James Whitmore). Or when he\u000aoversteps his boundaries and is thrown into solitary confinement. What\u000aquietly amazes everyone in the prison -- and us, too -- is the way he\u000aaccepts the good and the bad as all part of some larger pattern than\u000aonly he can fully see.The partnership between the characters played by Tim Robbins and Morgan\u000aFreeman is crucial to the way the story unfolds. This is not a "prison\u000adrama" in any conventional sense of the word. It is not about violence,\u000ariots or melodrama. The word "redemption" is in the title for a reason.\u000aThe movie is based on a story, Rita Hayworth and the Shawshank\u000aRedemption, by Stephen King, which is quite unlike most of King's work.\u000aThe horror here is not of the supernatural kind, but of the sort that\u000aflows from the realization than 10, 20, 30 years of a man's life have\u000aunreeled in the same unchanging daily prison routine.The director, Frank Darabont, paints the prison in drab grays and\u000ashadows, so that when key events do occur, they seem to have a life of\u000atheir own.Andy, as played by Robbins, keeps his thoughts to himself. Red, as\u000aFreeman plays him, is therefore a crucial element in the story: His\u000aclose observation of this man, down through the years, provides the way\u000awe monitor changes and track the measure of his influence on those\u000aaround him. And all the time there is something else happening, hidden\u000aand secret, which is revealed only at the end."The Shawshank Redemption" is not a depressing story, although I may\u000ahave made it sound that way. There is a lot of life and humor in it,\u000aand warmth in the friendship that builds up between Andy and Red. There\u000ais even excitement and suspense, although not when we expect it. But\u000amostly the film is an allegory about holding onto a sense of personal\u000aworth, despite everything. If the film is perhaps a little slow in its\u000amiddle passages, maybe that is part of the idea, too, to give us a\u000asense of the leaden passage of time, before the glory of the final\u000aredemption.\u000a

V\u000aThis movie is one of my favorites.First of all, scenes are so real in the mean time are dramatic enough. I especially liked the final scene and quotes about hope as movie\u000alasts. While watching, I did not expect that the film will have happy\u000aending so that one can think that escaping such kind of prison can\u000anever be possible. However in the end, this process became successful\u000ain a way that we can never imagine. From my point of view, with this\u000apoint, aim of movie is to show that in every hard situation it is\u000apossible to succeed with just not losing hope and be optimistic about\u000aour dreams which does not let us to give up, conversely to draw\u000aconclusions even we can never imagine. This movie had really huge\u000aimpact on this side.\u000a

Tim Robbins was wonderful in this and should have\u000awon an award,, Morgan freeman is captivating in his role as "Red" , Our\u000amain character, Andy Dufrene plans a prison break and needs the help of\u000aseveral of the inmates.. I wont' say what happens after his attempted\u000aprison break,, but this is a touching movie, with a lot of character\u000adevelopment, and not much on the action,, but it really doesn't need to\u000ahave a lot of action,, lot's of humor abound, a movie about growing up\u000ain person, and the people that you might, and the life struggles of\u000abeing in prison,, excellent movie.. but not the greatest of all time,,,\u000aI can think of at least 10 better .\u000a

V\u000aOne of my all time favourite movies. The film tells the story of Andy\u000aDufresne, a banker who spends nearly two decades in Shawshank State\u000aPrison for the murder of his wife and her lover despite his claims of\u000ainnocence. During his time at the prison, he befriends a fellow inmate,\u000aEllis Boyd "Red" Redding, and finds himself protected by the guards\u000aafter the warden begins using him in his money laundering operation.\u000aDefinitely worth the watch, if you haven't seen it. You are missing\u000aout. It is well written, scripted and well acted by Freeman and\u000aRobbins. This classic will be one that can be watched over and over.\u000aFrank Darabont made this the classic it is.\u000a

You start flowing with Andy and have a connect with him as the\u000amovie progresses. The story goes like this- Andy is send for life time\u000aimprisonment for allegedly killing his wife and her boyfriend,in jail\u000afirst few years were really bad but slowly he starts to find friend and\u000aalso some work. If I tell more than the whole suspense will come out.\u000aThe emotions carried out in each seen by red and Andy has been superb. Its a must watch!!\u000a

V\u000aI loved the Screenplay of this movie. How he narrate the story from\u000astart to end. I watched this movie in my mother tang TAMIL. That was\u000aawesome, That helped lot to understand each and every line of the\u000astory. Some liken the film to some kind of spiritual awakening. Of\u000acourse, some can go to a church or mosque to find enlightenment and\u000aFaith in humanity, but most places of worship are open only certain\u000adays or times. Darabont comes onto the scene and makes arguably the\u000abest King film ever. He seems to understand what King wants to say and\u000ahe conveys that beautifully.The bottom line is that The Shawshank\u000aRedmption is a perfect movie. It takes you in from the opening scene\u000aand doesn't let you go until long after it comes to a tremendous\u000aclose.like Thinner and Tommyknockers that border on unwatchable. In\u000aconclusion Shawshank is a brilliant film, that is worthy of the credit\u000ait has been denied for so-long.Very rarely are you left with a large\u000asmile and warm heart at the end of a movie but, I could have danced as\u000athe camera slowly panned back from the beach\u000a

V\u000aThis is for sure my favourite pre-2000 movie. Its prison, its life, it\u000ahas everything a guy could ask for and I didn't even name half of the\u000astuff in this movie! You have Andy coming in for a crime he didn't even\u000acommit, Tommy who got caught robbing some place, you even got Brooks\u000awho kills himself because he couldn't handle being out of prison. I\u000ahaven't seen the movie in a while, but I can see myself watching it\u000atonight. My favourite part would have to be the ending when Red and\u000aAndy meet in Mexico after Andy escapes, which I might add was really\u000acool too. How he dug a tunnel out and lead the guards off, that would\u000atake major skill if Hollywood magic didn't exist. Well, anyway, watch\u000ait. You will love it.\u000a

V\u000aThe beginning of the film is remarkable, but when Andy finally gets out\u000aof solitary confinement and is sitting against the wall next to Red,\u000ayou can feel the stress and the intensity of the movie. There is no\u000aother movie that I have ever seen where a silent intensity has ever\u000abeen done so well. You as a member of the audience know that something\u000ais going on, and the storytelling by Morgan Freeman seals the deal. The\u000aacting in this film is remarkable, and the subplots and the heartfelt\u000aending of the film truly make this film worthy of the number one spot\u000aon t list. The writers and casters of the film could not have selected\u000aa better actor for Andy's part than Tim Robbins, with his logical,\u000acalm, and reserved personality that reflected so well onto the film.\u000aFinally, the realization of the other inmates that Andy is in fact\u000ainnocent is absolutely chilling, and has you rooting for the character\u000aall along. This film is number one on the top 250 for a reason.\u000a

V\u000aLife in ShawShank Prison coalesces criminality, corruption, death,\u000atruth, god and hope into a wonderful film starring Tim Robbins and\u000aMorgan Freeman. Set in the 1940's, Andy Dufresne is a young and\u000asuccessful banker whose life is altered forever when he is convicted\u000aand sentenced to life imprisonment for the murder of his wife and her\u000alover. Shawshank demonstrates how quickly and naively the criminal justice\u000asystem can wrongly convict a man and alter his destiny forever. Lady\u000ajustice clearly is incapable of knowing all things and rendering\u000aperfect judgment.An innocent man at heart, Andy, with the help of his friend Red,\u000ashowcase the life of prisoners and put on full display internal prison\u000adynamics, the effects of lengthy prison sentences on the soul, the\u000aprocess of rehabilitation, and the will to survive with hope to live\u000aand fight another day. Following his conviction, Andy is tortured by a small immoral gang of\u000arapists until the warden places him in his protective womb. In exchange\u000afor his services and help with financial matters Andy's stature grows\u000aand his influence spreads. A friendly relationship develops over the\u000ayears, with Andy eventually processing tax returns, and subsequently\u000arunning a fraudulent scheme for the warden. Surprise twists find its way in the form of a truth telling inmate\u000aoverhearing the real killer of Andy's wife. Warden Norton wants no part\u000ain this, fearing for his operations and control of the institution.\u000aQuickly he pours ice on the idea, and subjugates Andy to physical\u000atorment to bend his will.Ever the precocious young lad, Andy secretly plots for over 20 years\u000aand reveals an astounding and ingenious strike to send Warden Norton\u000ainto a suicidal finale.Shawshank is a classic, darker than The Green Mile, yet truthfully a\u000areflection of how the system can go so very wrong. Sometimes, truth and\u000ajustice are not good enough, and one must rely on himself to adequately\u000arealign the scales.\u000a

V\u000aThis is without a doubt one of the best movies I have ever watched. It\u000ahas everything you can ever ask from a movie without being cheesy or\u000aover the top on any score.I love the way the story is told by the main character himself. You can\u000areally see the life of a prisoner in there and the struggle they all go\u000athrough. They somehow manage to find things to make them enjoy the time\u000aand eventually get used to the idea of staying inside the prison. They\u000aall learn to become friends but still finds enemies, like the warden\u000aand some of the guards. They are portrayed as the good guys even though\u000athey are prisoners who has committed crimes. You really bond to them\u000athrough the screen and can look through their eyes. The ending of this\u000amovie, the first time I saw it, was so unexpected! The way he had spent\u000aso many years to carve a hole in the wall and then escape. And then the\u000avery last scene when they meet each other again on the beach! 10 out of\u000a10!\u000a

V\u000aThe first time I heard about The Shawshank Redemption was during the\u000aOscars. They showed probably the worst scene they could (when Andy is\u000aplaying the opera music to the prison.) Unfortunately, I never got to\u000asee Shawshank in the theaters. I saw it on VHS and instantly fell in\u000alove with the movie. The story made me want it to go on forever. I\u000arented the movie five times before finally buying it on VHS. I cannot\u000arecommend this movie any higher. Since I saw it the first time in 1995,\u000ano movie has approached it. Frank Darabont directed a brilliant movie\u000aand made me a fan of his movies. For a story about two men in prison,\u000ait definitely surprised me. The story will keep you hoping to find the\u000atruth and sticking around to find out how it all will end. Hope you\u000aenjoy the show!\u000a

V\u000aThis film is on my list of all time favorites. It has an awesome\u000amessage. This film has so much depth and growth that its like a great\u000apage turner that you don't want to put down.Director Frank Darabont was out did himself in this film. He gave the\u000aviewer just the right amount of every aspect of drama, excitement and\u000asuspense to keep you on the edge of your seat wanting more. He gave\u000asuch a detailed depiction of prison life in a way that has never been\u000aseen on screen but yet gave us a sense of compassion for prisoners as\u000awell.Tim Robbins gave a very phenomenal performance from start to finish. He\u000awas the guy you just always wanted to route for. His performance was\u000agreat throughout the film . Robbins played Andy Dufresne who was\u000aconvicted of a crime and is sentenced to prison. He has to learn to\u000aadapt to a whole new life. He be-friends an African American man named\u000aEllis Boyd "Red" Redding played by Morgan Freeman. Red is feels as if\u000ahe has no hope of ever being anything more than an inmate and is\u000acontent with that. Red feels that the only way to survive is to become\u000astill to the world and try not to become institutionalized. Throughout\u000athe years Red watches his friend Andy go through a lot of things and\u000achange. Along with their good friend Brooks Halten played by James\u000aWhitmore who gave an awesome performance as well. The three experience\u000aprison life together but in different ways. Over all the\u000acinematography, the directing and the performances were EXCELLENT! If you've never seen this film it is a definite must see. You will love\u000ait and I bet it will be on your list of all time favorites as well. I\u000agive this film a excellent rating because it has all the makings of a\u000agreat film and delivers just that. It was a GREAT FILM all around!\u000a

V\u000aIt is hope that allows the self-proclaimed innocent man to survive what\u000amay or may not be an unjust imprisonment. And hope is his gift to his\u000afriend Red, who no longer even tries to impress the parole board at his\u000ahearings. He's become "institutionalized," he explains to Andy, and\u000awould be a "nobody" on the outside.Red's gift to Andy is absolution when he finally confesses his true\u000asins. Whether or not he pulled the trigger, Andy blames himself for\u000acausing his wife's death; his redemption comes as he learns to give of\u000ahimself over the course of this marvelously acted and directed film.Robbins gives a performance that evolves with beautiful clarity from\u000astarchy banker to warm and loving friend. Freeman is sure to gain his\u000athird Oscar nomination for his portrayal of Red. He also reads the\u000afilm's lovely narration, much of it drawn verbatim from King's 1982\u000anovella.A detailed portrait of the routine of cell block life, "The Shawshank\u000aRedemption" might change a few minds about the usefulness of\u000aincarceration in terms of rehabilitation. Mostly, though, it reminds us\u000aof that we all hold the keys to our own prisons.\u000a

V\u000aAs English is not my native tongue, it is a bit hard to grasp what does\u000a'Redemption' means in Shawshank's Redemption. In my understanding, a\u000aprisoned is helpless, who can he save?It is even more confusing that Shawshank is an innocent guy. Surely the\u000aword 'revenge' will be more appropriate to replace 'redemption' in this\u000acontext. As the film unfold, it becomes clear to me that Shawshank\u000aredeemed himself and others as he wasn't hateful. He calmly accept the\u000aunfairness in his life and dealt it with dignity and resilience. Some\u000atime, we are caged in a prison that's created by ourself. We often cry\u000aout 'it is unfair!' or 'It is not just!' But how often do we actually\u000atake any actions against them? Do we have the confidence that one day the prison wall will eventually\u000aget through by a small tool? Can we calmly deal with the pressure and\u000athreat that consume us mentally and physically? Are we ready to craw\u000athrough a gutter that's full of sh*t to reclaim our entitled freedom?When we in despair, it is encouraging to reflect on this fictional guy\u000a- Shawshank. Life some time is not about revenging, it is about\u000aredeeming. It is easier to revenge, but cooler to redeem.\u000a

V\u000aAfter years of hearing people praise this film, and occasionally\u000acatching snippets of it on TV, I made a point of renting the film.The Shawshank Redemption comes from a Stephen King story and has\u000aelements that might remind one of Stalag 17 or Cool Hand Luke. But this\u000amovie is an original gem. It is a tribute to man's indomitable spirit.\u000aAnd it shows the importance of hope--even in the lives of men who have\u000abeen institutionalized by an uncaring society via the prison system.Two things that make this film greater than others in the genre are:1. A villain that personifies evil so completely. The warden is made\u000amore villainous by his avowed dedication to Christian principles.2. The excellent screenplay creates "mini-mysteries" throughout by\u000aallowing the viewer to consider what happens at certain times, then\u000arevealing the unexpected truths. This engages the audience, and creates\u000atwists that entertain.This film deserves the hype it gets.\u000a

My mom made a great effort to get the\u000agood movie that were fun to watch for me, because I love comedy. Now, that was a really good movie!!!\u000a

V\u000aSimply put, it's one of the best movies out there and the fact that it\u000ais number one on IMDb's top 250 is a testament to that. I love how you\u000acan witness the characters undergo a complete 180 transformation and\u000ait's almost as if you and the audience make that transformation with\u000athem. It's a timeless movie that someone can watch 10 years from now\u000aand have just as enjoyable an experience as the first viewing. If you\u000ahave not seen this movie yet: YOU ARE MISSING OUT. With high highs, low\u000alows and plenty of clever humor this is a movie that I would Highly\u000arecommended to ANYONE! GO see this movie now. You won't regret it.\u000aAnyone who doesn't enjoy this movie is not human.\u000a

V\u000aThe Shawshank Redemption is a magnificent work, in which the drama\u000atakes place in a calm, striking and surprising. Frank Darabont is the\u000aideal person to adapt the works of Stephen King, manages to tell this\u000aheartwarming and inspirational story, conveying the hope of freedom and\u000ahappiness together for the spectator. Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman,\u000atwo superb actors, who once again showed their worth with this\u000aexcellent performance. The soundtrack by Thomas Newman is magnificent.\u000aThe end of the film, the way it is prepared, will surprise anyone who\u000aassists and dazzle with boldness and simplicity of this magnificent\u000adrama.\u000a

I would request everyone to see this one..It is total use of\u000athe minutes in which the movie starts and ends... I also like the\u000aaccent in which the language is being told to the audience..

V\u000aThere are few problems, and none of them are terribly distracting at\u000aall. There is a slight shimmering in a scene or two and some very small\u000ainstances of grain. Other than that, this is an excellent looking image\u000athat will certainly beautiful sound mix. It's also a newly remastered\u000a5.1 mix. It's not flashy or showy, nor does it need to be. It does\u000ahowever, do what it needs to do best very well. The score by Thomas\u000aNewman is absolutely wonderful and it sounds clear and crisp throughout\u000athe picture. Surrounds are put into use occasionally, but always in a\u000asubtle way that is right for the picture. What I was pleased about most\u000athough, was how rich and clean the score sounded on this DVD. Dialogue\u000ais clear and without problems as well. Again, Non-animated main menus\u000athat have the score playing in the disappointment of this DVD\u000a

V\u000aThe Shawshank Redemption is without a question one of the most\u000abrilliant movies I tally e'er seen. Siamese to The Immature Knot in\u000amore respects (and finer than it in most all of them), these two movies\u000achange shown us that Stephen Contender is a original not only of horror\u000abut also of prose that shakes the soul and moves the spunk. The\u000astrategy is mediocre, but Monarch did major things with it in his novel\u000athat are only furthered by the substance, and the acting is so top-rate\u000ait's near scary.Tim Robbins plays Andy Dufrane, wrongly imprisoned for 20 period for\u000athe slaying of his mate. The story focuses on Andy's relationship with\u000a"Red" Redding (Morgan Citizen, in probably his champion enactment) and\u000ahis attempts to escape from Shawshank. Bob Gunton is positively ugly\u000aand frightening as Warder Norton, and there are extraordinary\u000aperformances and cameos all around; the most salient one existence Gil\u000aBellows (new as Goat of Commonwealth McBeal) as Tommy, a feller inmate\u000aof Andy's who suffers under the robust instrument of Norton.If you haven't seen this picture, GO AND Payoff IT NOW. You instrument\u000anot be frustrated. It is positively the top show of the '90's, and one\u000aof my Top 3 of all indication. This flick is a blunder to move the\u000adesign, soul, and spirit. 10/10\u000a

V\u000aThis is with out doubt one of the best film ever made, it shows how the\u000abest of human nature can triumph in the darkest hour. The script is\u000aflawless and the acting is sublime. I've seen it more times than i can\u000acount and it never gets tired. Brilliant! The opening aerial shots of\u000athe prison are a total eye-opener. This is an amazing piece of\u000aarchitecture, strong and Gothic in design. Immediately, the prison\u000abecomes a character. It casts its shadow over most of the film, its\u000atall stone walls stretching above every shot. It towers over the men it\u000acontains, blotting out all memories of the outside world. Only Andy\u000a(Robbins) holds onto hope. It's in music, it's in the sandy beaches of\u000aZihuatanejo; "In here's where you need it most," he says. "You need it\u000aso you don't forget. Forget that there are places in the world that\u000aaren't made out of stone. That there's a - there's a - there's\u000asomething inside that's yours, that they can't touch." Red (Morgan\u000aFreeman) doesn't think much of Andy at first, picking "that tall glass\u000ao' milk with the silver spoon up his ass" as the first new fish to\u000acrack. Andy says not a word, and losing his bet, Red resents him for\u000ait. But over time, as the two get to know each other, they quickly\u000abecome the best of friends. This again, is one of the film's major\u000astrengths. Many movies are about love, many flicks have a side-kick to\u000athe hero, but Shawshank is the only one I can think of that looks\u000ahonestly at the love between two best friends. It seems odd that\u000aHollywood would skip this relationship time and again, when it's a\u000afeeling that weighs so much into everyone's day to day lives. Perhaps\u000ait's too sentimental to seem conventional, but Shawshank's core\u000afriendship hits all the right notes, and the film is much better for\u000ait. It's the kind of friendship that is honest, truthful and brings you\u000aback to the time in your life when the world was new and you and your\u000afriend owned it and in that sense it makes you think of another classic\u000a"Stand by me" by Stephen King. And it is this friendship and how the\u000aauthor, scriptwriters, director and cast manage to paint in colors that\u000aring true to our heart that truly makes this film stand out.\u000a

V\u000a"Shawshank redemption",definitely an uplifting among all the 90's but\u000adrowned in the celebrity pool created by the Forest Gump.Every thing in\u000athe movie happens in a prison(Shawshank)directer has given all the\u000aimportance to two convicts,Andy and Red(Tim Robbins and Morgan\u000aFreeman),movie starts with the arrival of Andy at the shawshank as a\u000aconvict for killing his wife and children,being a fresh meat at a\u000aprison like shawshank means a lot,Andy has to face a lot of\u000atroubles,enormous pain,emotional trauma during his period of double\u000alife sentence.Andy was even gang raped by a bunch of convicts,there was\u000anothing in the shawshankthat could hold back Andy from ending his life.Movie now actually\u000aclimbs to better energy level and the director(frank) puts a large\u000aamount of energy on Andy,he didn't quit,he stood,stood high with heads\u000astraight.He was totally a stranger among the fellow inmates.Movie now founds a new pace when Red(Morgan) tries to make a relation\u000awith the Andy(Tim),he finally become bonded to Andy.Andy soon became\u000afriends with the rest of the Red's crew,and they formed a group and\u000asticked together all the time.Andy here is a man of self respect.He\u000astarts a library inside the shawshank,he was a man of talent,soon he\u000awas doing the taxes of jail wardens.All these act make him a hero among\u000athe inmates, he even managed to bring beer'free beer'to the inmates\u000aafter a stressful work in scorching sun,now the movie gains some\u000anegative energy,as a jail guardian shoots down an inmate,as he has some\u000aIntel with him that could help Andy,thus the movie goes through a\u000aseries of events.Andy make his revenge in a perfect manner,completely\u000afreezing the warden and looting all his illegal money.Besides the viewing experience,"SHAWSHANK REDEMPTION" also has some\u000asocial importance,it tries to bring lights on the difficulties of the\u000aprisoners and their life in the prison and the life after their period\u000aof punishment,this can be viewed from the movie as a paroled convict\u000ahang himself in confusion of whats next. Definitely 'shawshank\u000aredemption' is its of a kind movie.A definitely watch one.\u000a

For anyone\u000awho has bothers to sit and watch this do yourself and favor and find\u000athe time. I am a huge Stephen King fan and for the master of horror\u000athis is easily the best screen adaptation of his work to date and it is\u000anot even of the horror genre.

It has\u000adefinitely the best narrative that leads to entertain and intrigue many\u000atimes. What is so awesome about the story? It combines drama, comedy\u000aand thriller. The script is great, because it relates the stories of\u000avarious characters during the whole film to reach a surprising ending,\u000athus captivating the audience at all times. Anyway, Shawshank\u000aRedemption has it all. This film is one of those whose ending I failed\u000ato predict. The ending twist is really genius.\u000a

V\u000aThe Shawshank Redemption is a film worth watching. Well-written, well\u000adirected and well shot, this film is entertaining throughout. It's a\u000areal tear-jerker with deep meaning, and is a must-watch for anyone\u000aremotely interested in movies. The only negative is that the story's a\u000alittle far-fetched, but it barely affects enjoyment of this film.The plot summary might make The Shawshank Redemption sound a little\u000aboring to the modern-day film fanatic, but it really isn't. It's filled\u000awith dramatic tension and is both depressing and uplifting, which is a\u000aquite rare characteristic for a film to have. This movie is not to be\u000amissed.\u000a

V\u000aI love this movie. No matter how bad my life may be going, "The\u000aShawshank Redemption" makes me feel better about everything. The idea\u000athat a man can remain unbroken against every possible setback,\u000ainjustice, brutality, and loss of freedom is an excellent painting of\u000athe indomitability of the human spirit. Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman\u000agive unforgettable, multi-faceted performances in these career-defining\u000aroles. Bob Gunton and Clancy Brown turn in chilling depictions of\u000acallous, sociopathic sadists in the guise of authority. The entire\u000asupporting cast is perfectly chosen and completely believable.Stephen King wrote this story at the end of his second period and in\u000athe beginning of his third phase of truly literary writing, and it\u000ashows. Frank Darabont is an amazing director, partnered with some truly\u000aincredible cinematography by Roger Deakins and a haunting, memorable\u000ascore by Thomas Newman. 10/10.\u000a

V\u000aShawkshank RedemptionThat name, Shawshank Redemption, has always been around since I was\u000aborn. I never really understood why everyone watched and spoke of great\u000athings about that movie until now. After watching Shawshank Redemption,\u000ait really opened my mind to a lot of different things. This movie not\u000aonly provided, the drama and crime, but it also provided action and\u000aeven a mystery. This movie is about a man who had a successful career\u000aas a banker; however, one day he came home to find out that his wife\u000awas having an affair with him. In anger he decided to pull out a\u000arevolver and fix the problem himself. So later on he is then accused of\u000afirst-degree murder and sentenced to two life terms in prison. While in\u000aprison the banker had a series of obstacles he had to overcome,\u000aespecially being a rich guy who had everything he wanted to be a\u000aconvict who is stripped away from their life. After a few years in\u000aShawshank Prison, the banker finally began to get acclimated. Later on,\u000ait did not take long for the banker to hear that he may be innocent and\u000athen try to devise a plan to show his innocence that just may or may\u000anot work. The main characters in this film were played as, Morgan\u000aFreeman and Tim Robbins; thus in my opinion, were outstanding actors\u000aand really portrayed their characters as if it were them living that\u000alife. I believe that the director of this film did a great job in\u000aproducing such an awesome movie. This review is actually very hard to\u000awrite because there is so many emotions I feel after watching the\u000amovie. How be ever, the movie offered a great deal of implied metaphors\u000asuch as when Morgan Freeman uses slang to describe his feelings towards\u000aother inmates which allowed the audience to constantly sit on the edge\u000aof their seat not knowing what might happen next. This movie may not be\u000ayour modern era film, but it definitely made an impact on the reality\u000aof life. The director, Frank Darabont, definitely put a lot of emphasis\u000aon how Tim Robbins' character was influenced by others throughout the\u000amovie. Same goes with Morgan Freeman, his character in this movie\u000aimpacted a lot of people either in a negative way or even a positive\u000away. In Shawshank Redemption, I think by the setting taken place in a prison\u000areally presented a more "harsh times" feel to the movie such as sexual\u000aharassment and brutal beatings by guards. Also I really enjoyed how\u000aevery little phrase or word, both by an inmate or a guard, stood out\u000aand brought a different meaning to the movie. When you watch this movie\u000ayou must pay attention to every little detail. If you don't, then you\u000awill be lost and continue to ask yourself, "What is going on?" That's\u000ajust how it is with Shawshank Redemption. In this movie you would think\u000ait would be just your average prison film but it's not. I would\u000arecommend this movie to anyone that is interested in a good\u000amystery/action and even a drama. This is an outstanding movie and I'm\u000aso glad I watched it because it definitely opened my mind about the\u000areality of life's struggles.\u000a

Also I really enjoyed how\u000aevery little phrase or word, both by an inmate or a guard, stood out\u000aand brought a different meaning to the movie. When you watch this movie\u000ayou must pay attention to every little detail. If you don't, then you\u000awill be lost and continue to ask yourself, "What is going on?" That's\u000ajust how it is with Shawshank Redemption. In this movie you would think\u000ait would be just your average prison film but it's not. I would\u000arecommend this movie to anyone that is interested in a good\u000amystery/action and even a drama. This is an outstanding movie and I'm\u000aso glad I watched it because it definitely opened my mind about the\u000areality of life's struggles.\u000a

V\u000aTHIS MOVIE IS THE BEST OF ITS KIND that I remember. This movie had me\u000athinking and trying to figure it out through most of the movie. Its\u000asurprising, humorous, sad, dis/encouraging, and all worth the wait. If\u000ayou like a MAKE YOU FEEL GOOD MOVIE thats down to earth, then\u000aDefinitely watch The Shawshank Redemption. It takes you through all\u000aemotions possible without being too harsh. This movie is great Alone\u000aand with Others EQUALLY. If you feel down, discouraged, or bored, then\u000aput this on IMMEDIATELY. The Shawshank Redemption is witty,\u000aunpredictable, informative, inspirational, Shocking but also A true\u000adepiction of past circumstances for the most part.\u000a

V\u000aNow writing a review to read for around 1 million viewers who have\u000aalready watched the movie may sound foolish. But since I am on a big\u000amood swing of excitement, I am writing it. Some movies never get old.\u000aSome reasons are no use of technology, never fading human feelings,\u000auniversally accepted ground concepts, etc. So, maybe because of these\u000areasons, The Shawshank Redemption seems to have found its way to the\u000aTop Alltime 250 Movies in this website. Overall, the movie made my day.\u000aIn fact it made my whole year. The main actor of the movie is no less\u000athan any super hero. Also you ought to believe that these kind of\u000apeople, these kind of incidents do happen in the real world. Although\u000amay not with these kind of drama. But, you can say, they do. I really\u000aregret that this movie did not earn much during its initial time of\u000arelease. A Straight sweep Full 10.\u000a

V\u000aI have never seen such an amazing film since I saw The Shawshank\u000aRedemption. Shawshank encompasses friendships, hardships, hopes, and\u000adreams. And what is so great about the movie is that it moves you, it\u000agives you hope. Even though the circumstances between the characters\u000aand the viewers are quite different, you don't feel that far removed\u000afrom what the characters are going through.It is a simple film, yet it has an everlasting message. Frank Darabont\u000adidn't need to put any kind of outlandish special effects to get us to\u000alove this film, the narration and the acting does that for him. Why\u000athis movie didn't win all seven Oscars is beyond me, but don't let that\u000asway you to not see this film, let its ranking on the IMDb's top 250\u000alist sway you, let your friends recommendation about the movie sway\u000ayou.Set aside a little over two hours tonight and rent this movie. You will\u000afinally understand what everyone is talking about and you will\u000aunderstand why this is my all time favorite movie.\u000a

He is genius.The story is slow to develop, and younger kids and children sensitive\u000ato the suffering of others may find this world a difficult one to sit\u000awith for the film's duration.If Andy were to have a retrial, he could expose the warden and bring\u000adown his mini empire. When Andy is told what the warden did, he breaks\u000aemotionally, the first time he does so after serving half his life in\u000aprison.Andy is the minister of the healing power of hope. He educates the\u000ainmates on the healing power of Mozart. Andy has not only been doing\u000athe warden's taxes but also doctoring his books to hide money he is\u000aillicitly collecting for labor the inmates are doing in the local\u000acommunity.\u000a

V\u000aThe Shawshank Redemption was originally released in 1994 and at the\u000atime it didn't receive its worthy praise, its due credit for being\u000awithout any doubt one of the finest movies ever made, a gargantuan\u000apicture. It felt considered to be truly great, yet nothing quite\u000aremarkable, why is that? Forrest Gump and Pulp Fiction are majorly\u000aresponsible. Also though when you're watching The Shawshank Redemption\u000afor the first time you might take notice of how fanciful it is,\u000aseemingly sugarcoated, and may tend to initially and foolishly discount\u000ait as being a soft misrepresentation of life in Shawshank, but as the\u000amovie perseveres through gruesome incidents and never shows a single\u000aimperfection, never seizes to amaze, it gradually becomes clear that\u000athis is a powerhouse of a movie, an undisputed masterpiece, and it's\u000anot a distorted viewpoint, it's just lighthearted and viewer-friendly,\u000aand you may be required to reassess your feelings towards the film to\u000abe valued as one of the very best movies of all-time. The Shawshank\u000aRedemption is remarkable. It's one of the very few films that succeeds\u000aand even excels at depicting life on the brighter side while still\u000amaintaining enough darkly despair in proper prism. Prison isn't a fairy\u000atale world. The Shawshank Redemption doesn't downgrade itself with a\u000atoo grimy depiction; it's shown in a more pleasant way, in a more\u000apowerful way, and it's better this way, with no overstated unsavory\u000atrauma. The Shawshank Redemption is loaded with unsavory trauma, it\u000ajust doesn't dwell on it. It ditches a grim outlook and upholds a\u000afaithful perspective. The Shawshank Redemption inspires great hope,\u000aeven when your spirit has fallen into the darkest of places. Andy\u000aDufresne is one of the best characters from film, period. Andy's\u000aunassuming, soft-spoken and distant nature makes him a prime target to\u000abefall victim to the hideous injustice of an ill-fated murder charge,\u000abut Andy is a brave soul, and he will seek redemption, even though\u000aAndy's very own soul is in most need of it. Andy's unfulfilled life has\u000afound new meaning in the most unlikely place, Shawshank. The story is\u000aamong the best ever told. I venture to say that the narration provided\u000aby Red is the best, the very best of any movie. The narration doesn't\u000acompel you with startling plot developments, rather it guides you with\u000areflection and comforts you throughout the indelicacies of the film.\u000aThe narration is the driving force and the lasting impression of the\u000amovie. The Shawshank Redemption is mega engrossing; you do not quite\u000aknow where it's heading, but you do not care because it is so good, and\u000awhere it does eventually land is sheer brilliance, true movie magic.\u000aThe end is simply genius, a clear metaphor for passing through\u000ahardship. I love that Red makes it to the good life too with Andy; this\u000amovie would have lost all of its might if not for its beautiful, happy\u000aending. The Shawshank Redemption is one of those rare dramatic\u000amasterpieces as it's right up there on the short list of being the\u000agreatest movie of all-time. Give it its due. (Hummmmmmmmmmm...the #1\u000amovie on the IMDb Top 250...that'll do.)\u000a

V\u000aIt's a masterpiece film that will have a value all the times. Some\u000acritics think after years of adulation and promotions from fans, that\u000aShawshank Redemption has gotten overrated. In my opinion, I think they\u000aare wrong. Never have I been so moved by film. Its intriguing without\u000abeing vague, intellectual without being conceited, long without ever\u000alosing pace but most of all what all art should be inspiring. I left\u000afeeling emotionally enlightened, enriched and equally drained.\u000aBreathtaking. The score was composed by Thomas Newman was stunning. The\u000amain theme ("End Titles" on the soundtrack album) is perhaps best known\u000ato modern audiences as the inspirational sounding music from many movie\u000atrailers dealing with inspirational, dramatic, or romantic films.\u000aShawshank Redemption is like wine I guess, the older it becomes the\u000abetter it becomes, really bizarre how it didn't appeal much at the time\u000a1994, it was pretty hard to beat Forrest Gump, and Pulp Fiction that\u000ayear. It end up having a cult following, after years and years of being\u000aaired on cable television to the point. A lot amount of people have\u000afinally view it, and most of the time share the same opinion, it was\u000agreat. You have two hours to dig into the story - and I can tell you it\u000awas worth it. Adapted from the Stephen King novella Rita Hayworth and\u000aShawshank Redemption, the film directed by Frank Darabont tells the\u000astory of Andy Dufresne (Tim Robbins), a banker who is sent to Shawshank\u000aState Prison for the murder of his wife and her lover despite his\u000aclaims of innocence. During his time at the prison, he befriends a\u000afellow inmate, Ellis Boyd "Red" Redding (Morgan Freeman), and finds\u000ahimself protected by the guards after the warden begins using him in\u000ahis money laundering operation. It wasn't until he meets Tommy Williams\u000a(Gil Bellows) does he heard that another inmate at another prison\u000aclaimed responsibility for an identical murder, suggesting Andy's\u000ainnocence. It was here that Andy makes a choice, continue to live with\u000athe sins in prison, or clean himself up by escaping it. The film wasn't\u000aabout a grand scheme of plot. It was unusual in the sense that it\u000adidn't matter what happens, but only that the message is fulfilled:\u000aFear can set you prisoner, hope can set you free. And it did fulfill\u000ait. Brilliantly. It is the script and the actors that make this movie\u000aso great. Morgan Freeman as Red is the highlight of the film. Before\u000aFreeman was cast, Clint Eastwood, Harrison Ford, Paul Newman, and\u000aRobert Redford were each considered for the role. Although the part was\u000adescribed as written as a middle-aged Irishman with graying red hair,\u000aDarabont cast Freeman for his authoritative presence and demeanor.\u000aMorgan Freeman is an amazing actor and his narrationing voice is so\u000asoothing. While I do like the narrations. Narration in films are always\u000aa sign of weakness in the story and plot. It is always used to cover up\u000aholes in the story; unless it conveys the protagonist's inner feelings\u000aand thought. Here, it conveys Red who is basically telling us what we\u000aare witnessing on the screen. While, I do like it, it wasn't really\u000aneeded. The acting of Tim Robbins was great as well. I love the scene\u000awhere he play a recording of Mozart's The Marriage of Figaro on the\u000aloudspeaker. Still, in some scenes, he's too wooden and stiff.\u000aFurthermore, he mumbles too much. Both, Tom Hanks and Kevin Costner\u000aturn down the role, two actors I do like. I also love Bob Gunton as the\u000aWarden, but I really wanted James Crowell as the Warden. I thought it\u000awould be amazing to have him in this film. There are some many themes\u000aand messages, it's hard to count. The biggest one is the fundamental\u000apillars of human life: hope. Some critics do have a problem with the\u000afilm in some areas like attempts to persuade the viewer to side with\u000arapists, thieves, and murderers. It didn't help that 2007, two inmates\u000aof Union County Prison escaped from their prison using similar\u000atechniques to those featured in the movie. I think the biggest fault,\u000ais that white collar crime pays if you are slick. While Andy was\u000ainnocent of the murders, he wasn't innocent in white collar crimes.\u000aAnother thing that some critics nitpick is the deep emotional\u000arelationship between two men. I don't see anything wrong with it,\u000athinking it as two men being friends. Some people say it's a homosexual\u000arelationship since in prison, homosexuality is normalized. This is\u000aclear throughout the film, not only through the characters of the\u000asisters gang, but how inmates' referral to new arrivals as "fresh\u000afish." There was also a lot of homosexual symbolism like the Rita\u000aHayworth poster covering up something and how the sewer scene was a\u000asymbol for anal sex. If that's isn't weird enough, some critics have\u000aspotted many allegorical themes in the film, generally along the lines\u000athat Andy Dufresne is a latter day Jesus Christ. No matter what people\u000asee in it; even with some prison film clichés, it still a great film. I\u000ado like the 1963's 'Great Escape" references with the socks. I don't\u000awant to spoil anything, but all I can say is, "I'm glad I took the time\u000ato watch this movie". Overall you build an understanding and feel for\u000athe characters, was real sad when certain characters died, really gets\u000ato you. The whole concept was smart, it just shocks how it was all put\u000atogether and it works so well. Brilliant movie. Recommend anyone to\u000awatch it at least once in their life time. Don't take my word for it.\u000aJust watch it. So Get busy living or Get busy dying.\u000a

V\u000aThis is hands down one of the best movies ever made if not THE BEST. If\u000athis movie is not in your top 5 of all time then you just plain do not\u000alike good movies. Each characters role is played/acted well, the\u000awriting is brilliant, the beginning through the end is just awesome. A\u000along movie but one of those movies like gladiator or a classic mob\u000amovie that is really long but you don't notice and by the end is\u000acertainly not considered a waste of time. I have always thought that\u000acable should have its own The Shawshank Redemption station where you\u000acan tune in at any time and it will be on. At no point in this review\u000aam I exaggerating and I think this movie deserves all the praise that\u000ait receives and then some. Some of the scenes especially the graphic\u000aones (rape) really make you feel emotion while watching and thats\u000adefinitely something lacking in newer movies and something we could\u000adefinitely use more of\u000a

V\u000aOne of my all time favorite movies that I could watch over and over. I\u000aloved the role of Tim Robbins character and of Morgan Freeman as well.\u000aI have not seen the movie in years and I think it is just about time to\u000awatch it and relive all the greatness of the movie from what I\u000aremembered from the first time. It was amazing to see a movie that was\u000awritten and acted out so well. Also sad to see someone spend so much\u000atime in prison as there 2 characters had. There are so many great\u000amovies that Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman each were in and this by far\u000ahas to be there best work of all. This is definitely a must see movie.\u000aSo if you have not seen this movie add this to your watchlist of all\u000atime great movies that you must see.\u000a

V\u000aRate: 9.7/10 Rounded to 10The Shawshank Redemption is easily the greatest movie of all time. Not\u000amany movies can compete with the greatness of this film. To start, the\u000amovie is based off a great book by a great writer. The Stephen King\u000anovel makes the perfect story for a movie. Next, the acting is great,\u000ait features two great actors: Morgan Freeman and Tim Robbins, who\u000atogether form an amazing team. Finally, Frank Darabont did a great job\u000adirecting this film. To sum it all up, this is a great movie. If you\u000ahaven't seen it... WATCH IT! I bet you'll like it.Was this review helpful? If so, check out my other reviews.

V\u000aWhy do I want to write the 234th comment on The Shawshank Redemption? I\u000aam not sure - almost everything that could be possibly said about it\u000ahas been said. But like so many other people who wrote comments, I was\u000aand am profoundly moved by this simple and eloquent depiction of hope\u000aand friendship and redemption. The only other movie I have ever seen that effects me as strongly is To\u000aKill a Mockingbird. Both movies leave me feeling cleaner for having\u000awatched them.I didn't intend to see this movie at all: I do not like prison movies\u000aand I don't normally watch them. I work at a branch library and one day\u000aas I was checking The Shawshank Redemption out to one of our older\u000apatrons, she said to me, "Whenever I feel down or depressed, I check\u000aout this movie and watch it and it always makes me feel better." At the\u000atime, I thought that was very strange. One day there was nothing on TV\u000aexcept things I absolutely would not watch under any circumstance or\u000athings that I had seen too many times already. I remembered what she\u000asaid, so I watched it. I have watched it many many times since then and\u000ait gets better with every showing.No action, no special effects - just men in prison uniforms talking to\u000aeach other.The Shawshank Redemption and To Kill a Mockingbird are the best movies\u000aI have ever seen. I do not judge it by it's technical merits - I don't\u000areally care about that. I have read that Citizen Kane or The Godfather\u000aor this or that movie is the best movie ever made. They may have the\u000abest technique or be the most influential motion pictures ever made,\u000abut not the best. The best movies are ones that touch the soul. It\u000atakes a movie like The Shawshank Redemption to touch the soul.\u000a

V\u000aParents need to know that this movie is rated R for a reason: The\u000agritty world of Shawshank Prison is populated with sadistic guards, a\u000acorrupt warden, and predatory fellow inmates. Two characters have sex\u000a(their clothes are on, and it's not graphic), one lovable character\u000ahangs himself, guards shoot an inmate and frame it as an escape\u000aattempt, inmates attempt and, we are told, succeed in raping Andy, and\u000aguards beat and kill an inmate in the opening scenes. But the film also\u000ashows inmates forming a loving community of friendship and support\u000adespite oppressive conditions.In THE SHAWSHANK REDEMPTION, Andy Dufresne (Tim Robbins) is convicted\u000afor the murder of his wife and her lover, and sent to prison. It's\u000a1949, and Andy doesn't have the stuff for prison life. Andy befriends\u000a"Red" Redding (Morgan Freeman) and uses his past as a banker to get a\u000ajob in the prison library. But things unravel. In doing the books for\u000athe warden, he learns that the prison boss is taking bribes, and Andy\u000ais to launder them. A lovable former inmate hangs himself when he gets\u000ato the outside after decades behind bars and can't adjust. The inmate\u000awhom Andy helps get his GED is shot by the guards to keep him quiet\u000aabout information that might prove Andy is innocent of the murders and\u000aset him free. Andy spends two months in solitary. After he gets out, he\u000aseems depressed and Red worries he'll kill himself. The next day, Andy\u000aisn't dead, but he isn't there, either. He's escaped. The rest is a\u000aperfect Stephen King happy ending, complete with come-uppance for the\u000acorrupt warden.Families can talk about the ways oppressed people have kept their\u000aspirit historically -- for example, through spirituals created by\u000aslaves. How do Andy and Red handle prison differently? How would you\u000ahandle such a bleak future? Why did Brooks feel more comfortable in\u000aprison than out of prison? Why did Andy get Red a harmonica? What did\u000athat represent? Why did Red and Andy disagree on whether they should\u000ahave hope for a better life? Did their class and race affect their\u000aapproach?\u000a

V\u000aThe #1 rating on IMDb.com's top 250 is no mistake. It was one of those\u000amovies where you feel exhausted at the end. Morgan Freeman was mind-\u000ablowingly authentic in playing Red and was made for the part. The plot was well thought out, and the escape by Andy was surprising\u000aeven as a viewer. And the last 20 minutes are the best of any movie I've ever seen. It\u000adidn't leave you in tears of sadness or happiness, just a fantastic\u000asense of closure. The acting was terrific and a spectacular way to use 2+ hours. Highly\u000arecommended and in my Top 10, easily.\u000a

V\u000aThe way portrait of the characters on the screen was very good. even\u000athough the carried a little bit melancholy mood but at the ending of\u000athe film you 'll get a feeling of watching an excellent movie.I have\u000anever seen such an amazing film since I saw The Shawshank Redemption.\u000aShawshank encompasses friendships, hardships, hopes, and dreams. And\u000awhat is so great about the movie is that it moves you, it gives you\u000ahope. Even though the circumstances between the characters and the\u000aviewers are quite different, you don't feel that far removed from what\u000athe characters are going through.It is a simple film, yet it has an everlasting message. Frank Darabont\u000adidn't need to put any kind of outlandish special effects to get us to\u000alove this film, the narration and the acting does that for him. Why\u000athis movie didn't win all seven Oscars is beyond me, but don't let that\u000asway you to not see this film, let its ranking on the IMDb's top 250\u000alist sway you, let your friends recommendation about the movie sway\u000ayou.Set aside a little over two hours tonight and rent this movie. You will\u000afinally understand what everyone is talking about and you will\u000aunderstand why this is my all time favorite movie.\u000a

V\u000aThere are so many movies take you by the heart, this one separates\u000aitself from the pack by having the special ability of moving you by\u000ashowing that everyone's life is bitter whoever you are and whatever you\u000ado.The cooperation between Frank Darabont and Stephen "the master of\u000aterror" King is very welcome at every angle in every title they work\u000atogether and The Shawshank Redemption is the peak of this\u000acollaboration. The story is the classical friendship in the most\u000aunexpected places with bitter twists found in most Stephen King\u000astories. And the images and the camera angles are carefully and\u000asuccessfully designed and executed.The movie takes you in for 2 hours and 22 minutes of a ride in time and\u000asenses.\u000a

V\u000aWhat does this film, and why, in fact, I'm wondering in the first place\u000athis issue? Probably because the main idea of \u200b\u200bwhat to look for and\u000amorality that the film brings to your mind, if it is of course possible\u000a- this is the most interesting. Moreover, you understood the book /\u000afilm - is a kind of specific experience in the treasury of his own\u000athoughts and knowledge.I read Stephen King's "Rita Hayworth and Shawshank Redemption." Not\u000asurprisingly, the book, however, as always, the better the movie. But\u000aFrank Darabont took unmatched movie that could play King wrote in his\u000abook, and in this film is definitely a plus.So what, exactly, teaches "The Shawshank Redemption"?Andy Dyufreyn for as much as twenty years, has lost none of its force\u000aof will, ruthlessly, albeit slowly, breaking free, with it in secret.Frantic zeal for freedom. Why would it not be worth it. He lost twenty\u000ayears of his life, because his wife, along with her lover killed by\u000aanother person. And is it fair?The warden continuously urged Andy to believe in the Bible. Called,\u000auntil one glorious day it has not broke big check, and the place of its\u000adocuments and reports that Andy was doing, he found that same Bible,\u000aand a note from Dyufreyna himself. Hopelessness, a setup? Not at all,\u000amy friends. Andy just gutted out the truth, bringing his tormentor took\u000ahis own life.And here it is, the same will, the life! Twenty years, he has only seen\u000aher in a dream!The very desirable house on the ocean near the Mexican land, a loyal\u000afriend, a little later freed Andy Dyufreyna, a small boat and\u000ahamburgers from a roadside cafe. He could not. He did it.Freedom of the most expensive.\u000a

V\u000aI simply love this movie, it just connects to you. Makes you feel like\u000ayou lived it yourself! With a reason on top of the list. Just a hearth\u000awarming story that gives you chills at moments. An really epic movie.\u000aIf you want the full experience read the book also. Steven King is a\u000amaster and a true artist! Just few movie remakes of the book are really\u000agood and this is one of them. An experience that can't be matched with\u000awith just watching the movie or reading just the book. The combination\u000aof dose two is one of the greatest things that you can do for the\u000aseventh art! I hope you enjoy my review and the movie.

V\u000aVery well done movie although I don't think it's as good as everybody\u000asays... One of the better movies I have watched and it is absolutely\u000aworth looking at it, no doubt! Unfortunately I don't like it so much\u000aanymore. That can depend on the amount of times I have watched it over\u000athe years at school etc. and it has gradually become a little more\u000aboring and I don't enjoy it as other movies like Batman. As a Tarantino\u000afan I like more brutality in movies than drama. The actors, story and\u000athe quotes in the movie is a big plus though! If you like movies or\u000aTV-series that is inside a prison I strongly recommend the TV-series\u000a"Prison Break". Well, back to the topic. The Shawshank Redemption is a\u000amovie that is worth watching. If you haven't seen it before it will be\u000aa very good movie to watch with your family or friends. As I said\u000aearlier I don't like it that much these days but it feels more like\u000ait's not really my cup of tea... I give it a 9 out of 10, fare and\u000asquare. /Andreas Flink\u000a

V\u000aI was so impressed with how every single subplot was given a great deal\u000aof respect and attention from the director. The acting was world-class.\u000aI have never seen Tim Robbins act as well since, Morgan Freeman maybe\u000a(e.g. Seven). The twists were unexpected, an although this film had a\u000afamiliar feel, it wasn't even slightly pretentious or clichéd, it was\u000aoriginal. The cinematography was grand and expressive. It gave a real\u000aimpression of the sheer magnitude of this daunting prison.But the one\u000athing which makes this story stand above all other films, is the\u000aattention given to the story. The film depends on the story and the way\u000ain which it unravels. It's a powerful, poignant, thought-provoking,\u000achallenging film like no other.One of my all time favorites. Shawshank Redemption is a very moving\u000astory about hope and the power of friendship. The cast is first rate\u000awith everyone giving a great performance. Tim Robbins and Morgan\u000aFreeman carry the movie, but Bob Gunton and Clancy Brown are perfect as\u000athe Warden Norton and prison guard captain Hadley respectively. And\u000aJames Whitmore's portrayal of an elderly inmate Brooks is moving. The\u000ascreenplay gives almost every actor at least one or more memorable\u000alines through out the film. As well as a very surprising "twist" near\u000athe end that almost knocked me out of my chair. If you have not seen\u000athis movie rent it or better yet buy it. As I bet you'll want to see\u000athis one more than once.\u000a

V\u000aAfter watching this movie I couldn't find a specific word to describe\u000awhat I was feeling and what I was thinking, the closest word that I\u000acould get was 'amazed'.

V\u000aBefore we can critically assess The Shawshank Redemption, we first have\u000ato deal with The Shawshank Reputation. In addition to its Oscar\u000anominations and huge critical acclaim, the film has topped the IMDb Top\u000a250 for years and shows no signs of dropping off any time soon. Any\u000aattempt to criticize it could come across as churlish or contraries,\u000athe work of someone attempting to be above what is popular for their\u000aown self-righteous sake. Fortunately, there is little need to criticize\u000a- for Shawshank really is as great as people make it out to be.It's easy to forget how much of a slow-burning success Shawshank was.\u000aDespite favorable reviews and its many nominations, the film barely\u000abroke even on first release. It was only with the VHS release that word\u000abegan to spread like wildfire, so that by the turn of the century it\u000ahad garnered a reputation as a modern American great. In an age where\u000afilms are dead in the water if they don't perform on opening weekend,\u000ait is hard to imagine a situation in which another Shawshank could\u000aemerge (although Slumdog Millionaire is a reasonable candidate).It's equally easy to forget how brutal the film is, particularly in its\u000afirst 20 minutes. Shawshank's reputation as a popular favorite might\u000alead the uninitiated to thinking that it's an uplifting, feel-good film\u000a- and it is true that these later moments are the ones which have most\u000aentered into popular consciousness. But any film about hope needs a\u000asource of despair to provide conflict, and Shawshank has more than\u000aenough violence and emotional trauma to justify its 15 certificate. As\u000aMark Kermode famously remarked, there's a whole lot of Shawshank before\u000athe Redemption.Even without its reputation, Shawshank is one of the best adaptations\u000aof Stephen King's work. Indeed, among King's dramatic stories, it is\u000aoutshone only by its successor The Green Mile. Frank Darabont has a\u000agreater understanding of King than almost any other filmmaker: he gets\u000athe tone spot on and recreates the period setting brilliantly with the\u000ahelp of Roger Deakins' cinematography. Despite the much-parodied\u000anarration that punctuates the film, the drama unfolds naturally and\u000abelievably throughout, with the characters always being at the\u000aforefront and naked exposition being kept to a bare minimum.Shawshank is a good example of how adaptation works - or more\u000aspecifically, how changes made to the original story in translation\u000aoften benefit the finished product. The best example of this is the\u000acharacter of Red, who in the original novel is a red-headed Irishman.\u000aThis is referred to jokingly by Morgan Freeman in one of his first\u000aconversations with Tim Robbins; when Andy asks why people call him Red,\u000aRed responds: "Maybe it's because I'm Irish.".On top of Freeman's obvious ability, the casting decision makes sense\u000abecause it adds an extra layer of meaning to the character. Red is one\u000aof the few black characters we come across; while he applies himself in\u000adifferent ways, he is as much of an outsider as Andy DuFresne. This is\u000aborne out by his remarks about institutionalization, which are laughed\u000aoff by his fellow inmates. Red may be well-connected when it comes to\u000asmuggling things in, but otherwise he is just as lonely as Andy.Shawshank approaches the theme of institutionalization with great grace\u000aand dexterity. Because the story takes place over three decades, the\u000atemptation would be to canter through the plot points and cut straight\u000ato Andy's escape - you could even stage the entire story in flashback.\u000aInstead, Darabont allows the film to unfold at a gentle, gradual pace,\u000areflecting the mind-set of the characters. They don't realize how\u000atrapped they are until it's too late, just as we don't realize that\u000atwo- and-a-half hours has passed until the credits have begun to roll.Shawshank is perhaps the most powerful depiction of hope in all of\u000acinema. The original short story, Rita Hayworth and Shawshank\u000aRedemption, was subtitled 'Hope Springs Eternal'. The film returns to\u000ahope and the celebration of the human spirit like a leitmotif, and\u000asucceeds because it retains Andy's humanity in all its many shades.\u000aWhile he is very different to the other prisoners, he is never\u000apresented as a saint or goody-goody, smiling gormless in the face of\u000amaddening torment. This makes his endurance all the more powerful: we\u000arecognize our faults in his moments of weakness, and aspire to his\u000ainner moral strength.The only fly in the ointment with Shawshank is its ending. The film is\u000aabout hope as a value in and of itself, emphasizing the importance of\u000ahaving it even if it is not rewarded. Red's transition to embracing\u000ahope is far more important than his reunion with Andy, and this reunion\u000ashifts the film's message from celebrating hope to justifying the\u000acharacters' pain on the basis of a happy ending. It's also clear that\u000athis ending was put together at the last minute, with subtle shifts in\u000athe cinematography and a far more rushed pacing to it.The Shawshank Redemption may not be entirely worthy of its number one\u000aranking on IMDb, but it remains a really terrific piece of drama let\u000adown only by its final scene. In every other aspect it's a masterpiece,\u000aas a character piece, a treatise on hope and a beautifully paced and\u000amounted Stephen King adaptation. It remains a must-see for all film\u000afans of penchant or persuasion, earning its status as a modern classic\u000aand securing a warm place in our hearts.\u000a

V\u000aloved the story the actors the emotions the drama Why do I want to\u000awrite the 234th comment on The Shawshank Redemption? I am not sure -\u000aalmost everything that could be possibly said about it has been said.\u000aBut like so many other people who wrote comments, I was and am\u000aprofoundly moved by this simple and eloquent depiction of hope and\u000afriendship and redemption. The only other movie I have ever seen that effects me as strongly is To\u000aKill a Mockingbird. Both movies leave me feeling cleaner for having\u000awatched them.I didn't intend to see this movie at all: I do not like prison movies\u000aand I don't normally watch them. I work at a branch library and one day\u000aas I was checking The Shawshank Redemption out to one of our older\u000apatrons, she said to me, "Whenever I feel down or depressed, I check\u000aout this movie and watch it and it always makes me feel better." At the\u000atime, I thought that was very strange. One day there was nothing on TV\u000aexcept things I absolutely would not watch under any circumstance or\u000athings that I had seen too many times already. I remembered what she\u000asaid, so I watched it. I have watched it many many times since then and\u000ait gets better with every showing.No action, no special effects - just men in prison uniforms talking to\u000aeach other.The Shawshank Redemption and To Kill a Mockingbird are the best movies\u000aI have ever seen. I do not judge it by it's technical merits - I don't\u000areally care about that. I have read that Citizen Kane or The Godfather\u000aor this or that movie is the best movie ever made. They may have the\u000abest technique or be the most influential motion pictures ever made,\u000abut not the best. The best movies are ones that touch the soul. It\u000atakes a movie like The Shawshank Redemption to touch the soul.\u000a

Brooks has built his entire identity around his\u000abooks and role in the prison; he is so afraid of this being taken away\u000athat he attempts to kill William Sadler's character so he can stay\u000ainside. Red is aware of how trapped he is, and shares Brooks' fears,\u000abeing unsure that he could get things for Andy on the outside. But at\u000athe same time, he refuses to let himself be vulnerable, trying to play\u000athe system and constantly getting turned down for parole. Andy allows\u000ahimself to be vulnerable and endures all the pain that it brings him,\u000asustained by the knowledge of his innocence and the hope that he will\u000aescape.Shawshank is perhaps the most powerful depiction of hope in all of\u000acinema. The original short story, Rita Hayworth and Shawshank\u000aRedemption, was subtitled 'Hope Springs Eternal'. The film returns to\u000ahope and the celebration of the human spirit like a leitmotif, and\u000asucceeds because it retains Andy's humanity in all its many shades.\u000aWhile he is very different to the other prisoners, he is never\u000apresented as a saint or goody-goody, smiling formlessly in the face of\u000amaddening torment. This makes his endurance all the more powerful: we\u000arecognize our faults in his moments of weakness, and aspire to his\u000ainner moral strength.The film has attracted many Christian interpretations - in fact, in my\u000areview of John Carpenter's The Thing, I called it "a poster child for\u000aChristianity". It's not hard to see why, considering its celebration of\u000ainner strength and devotion, and its overall arc of good triumph over\u000aevil against the greatest odds. While Andy has been called a Christ\u000afigure, he's just as close to the character of Daniel in the Old\u000aTestament: he finds himself in a strange land against his will, and in\u000aorder to survive he applies his natural talents to the service of his\u000atemporal masters. Through his labors the people around him benefit and\u000athe system is eventually changed for the better - albeit through pain,\u000asuffering and several deaths.An equally intriguing interpretation comes from Mark Kermode, who\u000aauthored a BFI Modern Classic on the film in 2003. In a video\u000adiscussing cinematic depictions of Richard Nixon, Kermode made the\u000aargument that Warden Norton (played brilliantly by Bob Gunton) is an\u000aallegory for Nixon, with Andy's prison term matching Nixon's political\u000acareer. Norton begins reaching out for friendship (Nixon seeking to be\u000aelected), then becomes the corrupt leader (beginning in the year that\u000aKennedy was shot), and finally descends into paranoia and disgrace,\u000aculminating in a more literal suicide than Nixon offered us.Whether you believe these interpretations or not, Shawshank is a\u000aterrific piece of dramatic film-making which soars on the strengths of\u000aits main performers. Tim Robbins perfectly captures Andy's distant,\u000aethereal quality while retaining his wry and infectious sense of humor.\u000aMorgan Freeman's performance may well be responsible for his subsequent\u000atype-casting, but he matches Robbins beat for beat, offsetting hope\u000awith world-weariness and guilt. There's also great support from two\u000aactors who would subsequently work with Darabont again - William Sadler\u000a(who appears in The Green Mile) and James Whitmore (The Majestic).\u000a

The main character, Andy trying to\u000akeep he life style despite the fact that he was in prison which is a\u000aplace of no freedom, no friends.What impressed me is that Andy made Red to get a poster of Rita\u000aHayworth and he stick it to the wall of his cell. We have been told\u000arepeatedly in most prison movie that a con should has no privacy and\u000apersonal belonging, that the jailer will keep destroying everything you\u000ahave and make you suffer. But Andy somehow managed to keep the sexy\u000aposter on his wall, made chess out of own time, that is impressive.To be honest, I was shocked because like everyone else I have been\u000aliving a life as a slave to the work->eat->sleep->work cycle and just\u000adon't have the gut to take the leap of faith into what is waiting\u000abeyond.I believe like Andy's dream of living next to the Pacific Ocean, which\u000ahe made it come true, everyone has a dream of his own and we should try\u000aour best to accomplish them.\u000a

V\u000aUp there with the best films of all time, great story line, great\u000atwist, great film from start to finish! The storyline takes you through the prison life of intelligent banker\u000aAndrew Dufresne who even though the crime he has been detained for he\u000adid not commit, remains quiet and takes the life sentence on the chin. Throughout the film he encounters many characters, some who take a\u000aliking to him for the right reasons, and some for the wrong reasons.\u000aBut what Andrew is plotting in secret will shock the entire Shawshank\u000aprison, and indeed the audience.With twists and turns at every corner, ups and downs and emotional\u000adrama, Shawshank is undoubtedly one of the best film ever made.\u000a

V\u000aI can understand how some people can feel that 'The Shawshank\u000aRedemption' feels underwhelming or bland, compared to other highly\u000aacclaimed movies. I guess having that notion that all classic films\u000ahave to be complex, with a bunch of overarching themes can influence\u000aone's perceptions of what is supposed to be a quality film. I have\u000alearned that every director has a vision with its own distinctiveness\u000athat differs from other directors. Whether its small or large in its\u000ascope, sometimes that is not the point. Some directors want to prove\u000asomething to make a point, while some just want to just make a story\u000athat's basically good, without the need to be over-politically or\u000asocially conscious to the point where it becomes pretentious.And 'Shawshank' is basically that. A good simple story about one's will\u000ato hold on to hope despite how heavy the circumstances. Sure, some\u000amight not view it as realistic for a story about prison life, but\u000aapplying to the concept of life in general is what fits and not if it\u000arings true to how life in prison really is. It's a more of a 'life'\u000afilm than a prison film. When one feels like they are in their own type\u000aof 'prison,' sometimes just having a friend to bring you a little\u000afreedom is all you need to feel free again, and that is a comforting\u000amessage in all its beautiful simplicity.With its 'floating on a cloud' atmosphere, it really has a soothing,\u000acalm, and tranquil atmosphere, despite the setting being a prison. This\u000atone is what separates 'Shawshank' from other films and becomes its own\u000adistinct world and with that the film comes off feeling more hopeful\u000athan dark at times, and I think that's more than I can ask for from\u000athis great movie, at the end of the day.\u000a

V\u000aThe Shawshank Redemption, a movie about hope, friendship and the will\u000aone person has to overcome unfair odds. Andy Dufresne (Tim Robbins) is\u000aa young banking executive accused of killing his wife and her lover and\u000ais sentenced to two consecutive life sentences in Shawshank Prison. In\u000aAndy's time spent at Shawshank prison, he befriends Red (Morgan\u000aFreeman) who also serves as the narrator of the film. Expressing his\u000afeelings towards Andy and the experiences both of them encounter at\u000aShawshank prison. The real question is will Andy and Red find salvation\u000aat Shawshank Prison or let the overbearing dark walls confine them to a\u000alife of being institutionalized?The setting naturally calls for the dark gloomy hopelessness one would\u000aexperience in a prison. The lighting and color palette used in the film\u000adefinitely cater to this feeling as dark shadowing and earthy dark\u000acolors are used throughout the film to amplify this feeling of\u000ahopelessness. There is not a stitch of color that is bright and vibrant\u000athroughout the scenes filmed in the prison. To counteract this theme of\u000ahopelessness Andy is the bright light at the end of the tunnel as it\u000aseems to neither bother him nor affect his outlook by being confined by\u000athe Gothic walls that surround the lives and men in the prison. This\u000aholds a symbolism of hope when everything seems bleak and doomed. This\u000ahelps holds the audience's attention as the subconscious sense of hope\u000aremains despite the obvious dark overtones. Throughout the film Andy's\u000ahope and faith are tested as many obstacles seem to overcome but never\u000abreaks his faith. Early this can be exemplified in the film by the\u000aconstant conflicts with the "sisterhood" and later by the hope that his\u000aname can be cleared and be released from prison based on another's\u000atestimony to the actual events that sent him there in the first place.\u000aThis becomes an extremely relief for Andy until that hope is shattered\u000aby other means. This would normally break the spirit of any man, but\u000awithin Andy we find strength and hope not only within him but the hope\u000ahe bestows unto his fellow inmates. The film itself is by far one of the best I have ever seen and from my\u000aexperience is either highly praised or has never been seen by the\u000ageneral public. The fact that this movie is on IMDb's top 250 movies to\u000asee does not surprise me since it is riveting and holds meaning that\u000amany can relate to and very few can ignore.\u000a

V\u000aThe Shawshank Redemption is an impressive story that focuses on two\u000athemes. The main theme is a heart-warming story of perseverance and\u000aredemption. The sub-theme is more akin to an exposé of the penal system\u000aand the horrors that it creates. These two themes intermingle\u000athroughout the entire film until it ends with an anti-climactic\u000arevelation that Andy Dufresne (Tim Robbins) has not only beaten the\u000asystem, personified in Warden Norton (Bob Gunton), but has also managed\u000ato save another inmate, 'Red' (Morgan Freeman), from death. The\u000adirector and producer work together in an impressive combination of\u000ascreenplay, lighting, sound and editing. I won't spend too much time on\u000athe screenplay, simply because I cannot do it justice. However, the\u000awriting and acting were impressive to say the least. The actors mingled\u000ain a way that very effectively reinforced the two themes stated above.\u000aDuring their time at Shawshank the actors progressively lose their\u000avitality and morality. As the movie progresses all the characters show\u000athe oppressive effects of the penal system, both when it is used as\u000adesigned as well as when it is abused by the Warden. Andy is no\u000aexception to this rule. I feel that the film is designed to show us\u000athat Andy would be destroyed by Shawshank as well, if he hadn't found\u000athe means to be free of it. Lighting and color were another medium that\u000athe director took advantage of to portray the misery and glory of\u000aAndy's story at Shawshank. The Shawshank Redemption was filmed with a\u000astrong preference for harsh lighting. Very rarely in the film is anyone\u000aportrayed graciously, even our main character is exemplified for his\u000aflaws. The color choices were even more indicative of the harsh\u000arealities of Shawshank prison. The prison is practically gray-washed,\u000aand would have been almost as effective if it were filmed in\u000ablack-and-white. This strongly supported the sub-theme that speaks\u000aagainst the penal system. However, when Andy makes the choice to do\u000asomething with what little freedom he has, there is a significant\u000achange in the color of the film. This is most notable in the opening\u000aand expansion of the library. During these scenes the lighting and\u000acolor of the film seems to brighten considerably, showing the viewer\u000athat Andy's perseverance of attitude and self-improvement have a\u000adistinct effect on the nature of even Shawshank's oppressive walls. The\u000asound and narration of the film also relate well to the film. The sound\u000aeffects in the film are universally harsh lending weight to the\u000aoppressive atmosphere. The stark grinding of metal bars on stone, or\u000athe shuffling of inmates feet are sounds that are good examples of\u000athis. The narration serves a dual nature. It is almost necessary just\u000ato speed the progress of the film that covers a number of years of\u000aimprisonment. However, it also teaches us a lot about the history of\u000aShawshank. The narrator's voice is old and seems weighed down with\u000aRed's own battle at Shawshank. However, it also holds a measure of\u000aHope, a feeling that seems foreign to the gray walls of the prison.\u000aThis duality of emotion exemplifies the nature of the war between the\u000atwo themes of Hope and Oppression.\u000a

Andy Dufresne\u000a(Tim Robbins) is convicted for the murder of his wife and her lover; he\u000aalso befriends a convict named Ellis Boyd "Red" Redding (Morgan\u000aFreeman) as he eventually gains the respect of the other inmates. Roger\u000aDeakins' cinematography has the ability to capture Andy's sense of\u000adetermination and optimism in Shawshank prison.

V\u000aIn the same year this awesome film was made, I watched Pulp Fiction\u000awhich changed my interest in films from a pastime, to a major part of\u000amy life. However, for some odd reason I never saw Shawshank at the\u000acinema and it wasn't until 1999 that I became the happy owner of this\u000afilm on a ropey VHS tape. Two years passed by when Stella (Artois) were\u000aadvertising a promotional event, enabling you to drink their beer\u000awhilst watching a movie in a quirky location relevant to the film. So\u000awe watched Dead Poet's at an Oxford College and then came this\u000aopportunity to view Shawshank at Oxford's old disused prison :-)\u000aArriving at the prison, actors were dressed as U.S prison guards,\u000averbally berating us and marched us through the fantastic old prison\u000a(now a swanky hotel), through to the prison yard where we viewed this\u000aepic again, but this time on a huge screen, in the best possible\u000asetting, with my lovely wife to be, and a few bottles of suds :-) To\u000asay this was the one of the best days of my life apart from our\u000aeventual wedding and the birth of our 2 children of course, is not an\u000aexaggeration! The sad thing is, nearly 20 years have gone by since the\u000amaking of this film, and all flicks since have not touched the wonder\u000aof this movie.\u000a

V\u000aA must watch movie. Redefines the emotions like hope and trust etc. The\u000acharacter of Morgan Freeman is also fantastic. Got to know what prison\u000ais . Life Sentence is one of the most torturous Punishment one can get.\u000aThe planning process of the escape is just mind boggling. But I still\u000acan't believe that a person can keep his hope for this long. Al though\u000aI doubt that in 19 years, his cell was not changed. But of course this\u000amovie was released way back in 1994. Got to know much about American\u000aprison and prisoner- maintenance system that existed then. Morgan\u000aFreeman plays his character well and so does Tim. every part of the\u000amovie will be well understood as the movie progresses. Its a long but\u000ainteresting movie. After all, these many internet reviewers cant be\u000awrong. But it is not the best movie of all times.\u000a

V\u000aMovies are meant to entertain. Most of the times, they even fail to do\u000athat. In this era, dominated by Computer Generated Imagery (CGI), most\u000amovies project an alternative reality, a getaway from our dry world. In\u000asuch manner, it is fun to watch and even very entertaining.Only might bring up The Dark Knight, which is also a truly great movie,\u000ain such conversations but in the end it is futile.The Shawshank redemption is a class of movies, which until now has only\u000agot itself in it. This movies forces us to question ourselves. Through\u000athese movies, we live someone's else life and understand it.It is entertaining as hell not cause of the imagery or the camera work\u000aor the some cool gadgets rather cause it strips down the beautiful\u000ahuman nature and portrays the intricate feelings in a form so powerful\u000athat it may be more of a reality than this life is.Every time you watch this movie, you learn about yourself.

V\u000aAt the early stages of this film, when Andy arrived at the prison in a\u000abus full of other prisoners, one of the guards told the new arrivals to\u000adiscard their cell phones. Did I hear this incorrectly? Anyone knows\u000athat cell phones were not invented anywhere near 1947.As for the film itself, I rarely score a '9' and the only '10' was\u000a'Montenegro,' an American/Swedish co-production, black comedy made in\u000athe mid-80's. Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman, as well as the warden\u000a(Frank Dunton) were superlative and the script was so good, one might\u000athink the story was based upon fact, whereas it is fictional.A Yale (or was it Harvard?)law school study revealed that 7% of\u000aincarcerated inmates are innocent. One prominent attorney said that was\u000aan 'acceptable' percentile. I don't want him as my defense attorney.I liked the ending. It doesn't leave the viewer hanging. While sanding\u000ahis boat in working clothes, I'm sure Andy lived in a mansion above the\u000aPacific Ocean. $377,000 was a lot of money in 1966.\u000a

V\u000aThe Shawshank Redemption can probably be accurately described as the\u000aking of the sleepers. For a good number of years now this film has\u000aroutinely been included at the top or just off the top of best films of\u000aall time lists. Yet, unlike most others with that type of prestige,\u000athis film did not do well at the box office on initial release; it did\u000aget nominated for several Oscars but didn't actually win any. It was\u000aonly once it was released on home video that its reputation began to\u000agrow and grow. Nowadays it's almost taken for granted that Shawshank is\u000aone of those films that many people consider their all time favourite.\u000aFor me personally, I can't truly understand the magnitude of love that\u000aShawshank engenders. I think it is certainly a great film though.It's based on a Stephen King novella called 'Rita Hayworth and\u000aShawshank Redemption'. It's a prison drama and the story itself is\u000aquite straightforward. It's essentially about an innocent man\u000aincarcerated within a corrupt legal system. It has some well observed\u000athings to say about men being institutionalised and the direction is\u000aexpertly handled  it takes it's time, keeps things simple but is never\u000aless than compelling. But what really makes this film work is the\u000acharacterisations and the excellent script. There are two great central\u000aperformances from Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman. They have a real\u000achemistry together and you really believe in their friendship. In fact,\u000ait's friendship that Shawshank is effectively about. I think it's this\u000afactor more than any other that has helped it make such a wide\u000aconnection with people.\u000a

V\u000aIt is not the first time that a movie presents the development of a\u000adrama in a U.S. prison. It contains elements of violence, depravity (of\u000aprisoners, their guards and the director), corruption, indifference,\u000ainjustice, loneliness, solidarity, ingenuity developed by limitations,\u000aperseverance and tenacity to develop for more than two hours a good\u000ahuman story culminating in a happy ending "Hollywood-style". It highlights the good performances of Morgan Freeman and Tim Robbins,\u000athe telling of the story from the point of view of one of the inmates\u000a(Freeman), the criticism of the prison system culminating in the desire\u000aof their oldest prisoners to stay there instead of the alternative of\u000adealing with a hostile and unknown world as soon as they are released\u000afrom this status to their new freedom (the Netherland's syndrome). It is a message of perseverance, faith and strong commitment to a goal\u000afrom inmates unfairly treated and judged as well as of indifference\u000afrom a society that had created this scheme.\u000a

V\u000aA very good movie. It is possible that the men (adult males) will find\u000athis movie more appealing than women (adult females). Tim Robbins and\u000aMorgan Freeman give very good performances. In particular, Morgan\u000aFreeman excels like he seems to always do in his movies. I can never\u000aget used to the type of character that Morgan Freeman plays because of\u000ahis versatility of roles he has played. The movie, although not fast\u000apaced, draws you in and keeps you interested. I could have sat through\u000aan additional 20-30 more minutes of film. However, the movie appears to\u000abe of sufficient length. Quite to my surprise, the ending was not\u000aentirely predictable. Older children (10+ years) would also enjoy this\u000amovie. This is not a chick flick so boys don't bring your date to this\u000aone. OK to share with long term girlfriend or wife though. This move\u000adoes not inspire romance nor was its intent. A good film to sit down\u000awith popcorn.\u000a

V\u000aThe other day I saw Shwashank Redemption (yeah yeah, I had to be\u000aclobbered to watch it, more fool me). What an intense movie! Yes it is\u000aan epic movie, yes its beautifully narrated, but what struck me most\u000awas this movie reminded me of Joseph, son of Jacob in the bible.I mean look at the similarities- Joseph the favorite of Jacob, apple of\u000ahis fathers eye. Joseph who dreamed about ruling over his brothers. And\u000ahere we have Andy, the blue eyed genius of the banking sector, who has\u000ait all, money, position and a beautiful wife.Joseph is cheated by his brothers and sold into slavery. He is then\u000atempted by his boss's wife, and he resists the temptation in good\u000afaith. But anyway he is falsely implicated and sent to prison. Andy\u000agets cheated by his wife and best friend, in a fit of drunken rage Andy\u000aentertains the idea of harming then, but quickly sobers up and resists\u000athe temptation. Andy also gets falsely implicated.So now we have two innocent men in prison, but both don't let\u000acircumstances deter them. Both use their talents where they were placed\u000aand grow and rise to new heights. Joseph found favor with the warden\u000aand became in charge of the prisoners. Andy started filing tax returns\u000afor all of the prison guards and was made the library in charge.Joseph is freed from prison because of his ability to interpret dreams.\u000aJoseph is made the governor of the land and becomes very prosperous.\u000aAndy's banking skills allow him the leeway to manage his escape from\u000aprison. Andy comes across great wealth that he was managing for the\u000awarden.And finally Joseph gets reunited to his family, while Andy gets\u000areunited with Red who was his friend from the prison.Amazing coincidence, ain't it?\u000a

V\u000aThis film is great. I cannot imagine someone walking away from this\u000amovie thinking it was even okay never mind bad. Shawshank redemption\u000abrings to the table a great story line, great acting and great\u000adirection but not the best of all time (In my opinion). I can totally\u000aunderstand why people would think this is the greatest film of all time\u000abut I would disagree. The year 1994 to my knowledge is the greatest\u000ayear in film of all time, bringing five of the best films you will ever\u000asee, 1. Pulp Fiction, 2. Forrest Gump, 3. Leon, 4. The Shawshank\u000aRedemption, 5. The Lion King. Now I am not writing this review to say\u000athat this is in anyway shape or form a bad movie, as it is a classic\u000athat should never be forgotten but I am here to say it is a great film\u000abut not the best. Morgan Freeman and Tim Allen do act two great performances in this\u000amovie as two inmates at Shawshank prison and some of the dialogue in\u000athis film is phenomenal. If you haven't yet seen this film please do,\u000ayou will not regret it.8 Out of 10\u000a

V\u000aDamn son, why is this movie so high in the charts? Isn't it another\u000aprison movie?  Oh it is more? The convicts are the good guys and the\u000awardens are the bad guys? Wait a second there champ; isn't that the\u000acase for every prison movie there is? What is that? It has Morgan\u000aFreeman having lots of cool internal monologues that border the poetic?\u000aAnd speaking of poetic, isn't there a lot of poetic justice in this\u000amovie? There is? I SEE WHAT YOU DID THERE!OK folks, let's be straight about it. This movie is a teen adventure\u000amasked as a gritty drama. The setting is pessimistic as heck and the\u000acharacters act like they are all boy scouts. If you see the whole thing\u000afrom a realistic point of view, it is basically making heroes out of\u000acriminals and villains out of the system of justice. And it is also\u000aabout rewarding the heroes and punishing the villains with a cop-out\u000away and heading for poetic justice.Of course the movie was never supposed to be realistic and it is a\u000amistake to go in with a critical mind. It is about a feel-good\u000amentality, to never give up no matter what problems life throws at you.\u000aSo seriously, don't try to reason that sweet old guy who didn't want to\u000aleave prison but the evil warden gave him his freedom and thus ruined\u000ahis happiness. Neither try to make sense of why the system refuses you\u000aparole while you want to and agrees when you give up. Or how someone\u000adigs a tunnel for 20 years and an inspection never finds the hole or\u000athe soil he was removing. That is not the point anyway. It is about\u000amaking the best of what you have and defending your ideals with your\u000alife. A thing which definitely stands out is that the objective of the film\u000ais not for the protagonists to escape. Freedom is not found outside the\u000awalls of the prison yard but in the state of your mind. This is what\u000aAndy manages to offer to everyone by gradually transforming the gray\u000acells into a place where the inmates can find recreation, hobbies, and\u000aeven wisdom through a library. They find happiness even when confined. Of course I am too much of a cynical bastard and I couldn't get into\u000athe above mood so well. Call it unwillingness to suspend disbelief but\u000awhen I saw all the things Andy offered to the inmates I was only\u000athinking of how more dangerous they will be if they ever get out, with\u000aadded wisdom and crafts in their disposal. Because most criminals don't\u000areform in prison as you probably know; they learn new tricks and come\u000aout more dangerous than before. Of course the movie was heading for the\u000afluffy feeling of thinking "Hey, if you give criminals enough hobbies\u000aand recreation in prison, and treat them like human being, they will be\u000alaw- abiding citizens when they return to society". Sweet thought, but\u000astill unrealistic since it mostly takes for them to get a proper job to\u000asupport a family and stay away from their criminal connections. And\u000ayes, I am missing the point but that is how I felt while watching it. Would any of the magic in this film work if we were told that every\u000amajor convict had killed a dozen people, raped several women, and\u000amolested his own kids? Nope, but the past is not the point. It is abut\u000aoffering redemption to them regardless of what they had done. Giving\u000athem a second chance if they deserve it and helping them to get back on\u000atheir feet after all the beating life gave them. Sweet concept, very\u000anicely presented, but I am still a cynical bastard, so I give it no\u000amore than a 7/10.\u000a

V\u000aGreat narration by Freeman, as always.I felt they set the mood and pace in the prison very well. I think the\u000aacting by Robbins could have been a bit more emotional or clear, as\u000asometimes he seemed a bit dull. Acting by Freeman was great and his\u000afinal release from prison held emotion.Also touching was the final letter from the old guy who got released\u000afrom prison. I believe his suicide speech was one of the best parts of\u000athe film and Freeman's explanation of it very deep.I feel like the one thing the movie was missing was a dramatic\u000avengeance on his wife's killer. It is the one thing that could have\u000atruly caused full completion. Even if this added another hour to the\u000amovie, I believe this would have been worth it.\u000a

V\u000aI can't say enough about this film its simply the King of Kings when it\u000acomes to movies.Other movies might have something better, but put all\u000athe contents of a great movie together and this one hast is all\u000aNarration, acting, humour, direction, story, suspense, soundtrack...the\u000afull package.Its a powerful movie and I don't know how you can keep\u000ayour emotions in check with such a intense story. Its a tragedy this\u000adidn't win an Oscar for best picture over Forrest Gump...for me there\u000aisn't many movies that possess the overall strength of this movie,\u000ahence why its still #1 in on IMDb and top 5 on many other reputable\u000ainternet sites.\u000a

V\u000aWell, not only that but perhaps the greatest film of all time as well.Tim Robbins and more-so Morgan Freeman give their best performances\u000aever.It is perhaps a crime this did not win best picture but at least it was\u000anominated and I cant really get to mad as Forrest Gump is a top 10\u000amovie ever.This is 3 hours but it just flies by.The characterization is perfect.One of the most unique dynamics of the film is we all root on Andy\u000aDufresne (Robbins) without knowing for sure if he is actually the\u000amurderer or not.We also feel compassion and empathy for Red (Morgan Freeman) even\u000athough HE DID commit murder.You get to like these characters a great deal learning about their\u000apersonality inside the Shawshank Prison.The Wardon and the guards abuse their power making Andys escape one of\u000athe most feel good endings of all time.You cant help but smile.A movie everyone should see, numerous times and have in their\u000acollection.Get busy living..or get busy dying...\u000a

V\u000aBefore I begin, I just would like to say that this review is not for\u000asomeone who has seen the movie, and wants support on their opinion,\u000athis is for people who have not seen The Shawshank Redemption and want\u000ato know what a fellow movie-watcher thought of the movie.Do not get me wrong, Shawshank is a fantastic movie. For a movie that\u000ais all dialogue and no action, it really delivers. And when I say "all\u000adialogue and no action" what I mean to say is, there are no car\u000aexplosions, car chases, heists or anything you would see in a\u000ablockbuster. I'll keep this part as obscure to avoid spoilers but the\u000amost action filled part would be when a man is shot in the chest. Or\u000aperhaps when there is a police beating. But that's not where the\u000acinematic gold of Shawshank lies. The cinematic gold lies in the\u000acharacter development and the message of hope that it holds within.The Shawshank Redemption shows us that hope can be your best friend and\u000aguide you through your tough times. As you can see I rated The\u000aShawshank Redemption 10 out of 10 stars, but I do not believe that is\u000ashould be #1 on IMDb's Top 250. I believe it should be at least in the\u000aTop 20, but not #1. I believe that The Godfather should be #1 but\u000athat's a different topic for a different time.My recommendation is to buy this movie. If you rent or borrow it,\u000ayou'll be disappointed when you have to return. The Shawshank\u000aRedemption is a movie you'll want to watch again the minute it is over.\u000aI can almost guarantee you will feel inspired when you have finished\u000athe movie. I would not call Shawshank a "triumph of the human spirit"\u000amovie, but it really portrays a hopeful message. In regards to appropriate viewing audiences, I am a bit torn. While\u000athis is an inspiring movie, there are a lot of elements that could be\u000aconsidered too taboo for children. But look over IMDb's Parent's Guide\u000afor this movie and make the call for yourself.\u000a

V\u000aThere's a particular scene in The Shawshank Redemption where Andy is\u000ajust sitting there listening to random opera music. Where Any feels\u000afree and full of hope. That scene full of brilliance defines the whole\u000amovie. If one analyzes this movie, many themes arise. A theme of hope,\u000aa theme of redemption, a theme of second chance, a theme of bonding or\u000aeven themes of friendship. If you see the movie the first time, you see\u000ait through the eyes of Andy but the second time, one realizes it's\u000areally the story of Redd and his redemption.Andy is a successful banker and is guilty of murdering his wife. He is\u000asentenced for life in Shawshank Prison. During his sentencing he\u000astumbles upon many inmates and one of them ends up being his friend\u000aRedd. During his sentencing Andy does taxes for the Guards and helps\u000athe warden in some illegal activities. The moments in those many years\u000ais what makes Shawshank.The movie is full of unforgettable moments and unforgettable\u000acharacters. All characters are well developed and well written. What\u000aworks most is that the movie has a simple story yet the deepest meaning\u000ato it. The multiple themes are brilliantly depicted.The climax is just heartwarming! The direction is flawless. Every\u000asequence is brilliantly executed. It's a shame the Oscars ignored Frank\u000aDrabont.Another plus point is the casting of the movie. Every actor suits the\u000arole to the T. Tim Robbins is just brilliant as Andy! He's nothing\u000ashort of spectacular.Bob Gunton is also another act to look out for. He's first rate. All\u000athe other actors are also flawless.Having said that, a performance you take home with you is of the\u000abrilliant Morgan Freeman. It's really tough to describe in words how\u000agood of an act his was. One really wants to applaud him by the end of\u000athe screening.Overall, Shawshank is a movie of a lifetime. Missing it is a crime!\u000a

V\u000aI can see from the bulk of the reviews on this page that I don't have\u000ato write a glowing review of this film...but I want to. Having read\u000amost of Steven Kings work I cant tell you how many times I have been\u000alet down by films made from his writing. In my opinion however this\u000afilm surpasses his story so much so that it becomes the best film ever\u000amade. Morgan Freeman's narration of the film gives me goose bumps,the\u000astory just grabs hold and will not let you go. This film is long but I\u000aguarantee when you reach the end you will wish it would just keep\u000agoing. The DVD is lacking in special features which is a shame because\u000aI'm sure I would have watched those countless times as well. All in all\u000aI say not only should everyone see this movie (rent it now!!!) but own\u000ait as I do.\u000a

V\u000aA prison escape that is technically so much better than other prison\u000aescape stories.A man wanted freedom, he redeems his life by escaping for the Shawshank\u000aprison and the man's name is Andy Dufrsne. This film is dramatic take\u000aof a man, and in a way it is similar to Escape from Alcatraz and The\u000aGreat Escape. The similarity is that the above mentioned films are also\u000aprison escapes and the similarity ends there. This movie is more about\u000ahope and redemption than anything else and this is what sets this film\u000aabove the other escape stories. For a man, freedom is highest value and he would do anything to get it.\u000aAndy Dufresne (Tim Robbins) is such a nice fellow that we would for\u000asure like him for the way he is, when he chuckles at the warden when\u000amusic is played in prison or when he asks for beers to his friends\u000awithout having a sip. We like him because he is selfless, humane in\u000anature. But more so, he is selfish and works towards his freedom at the\u000asame time. Now, in terms of character he has company n the firm of Red\u000a(Morgan Freeman) and what a great character, RED was, is understood, by\u000athe way he narrates the story. And thus, it's not surprising for Morgan\u000aFreeman to have garnered more best actor award nominations than Tim\u000aRobbins. The novel, written by Stephen sets it up in 1949 - 1966 period in a\u000aprison called Shawshank in Maine, USA. Frank Darabont made it into a\u000afilm that's great to see but also tests our patience. It's great in\u000aterms of cinematography, lighting and costume design and even art\u000adirection, but greater was the acting by two lead characters. Just\u000abecause of their acting, I was compelled to see this story of HOPE,\u000athat ends in a good way.The sound design is great and worthy of a special mention as a\u000arealistic sound the prison of 1940's to 60's was created. Editing\u000athough, I believe could have been done by cutting short a few scenes,\u000aor rather cutting out a few scenes, just like say one week of hole for\u000aBogs. I have seen this thrice and, since I knew that this is the best rated\u000apicture on IMDb, but the more I see it, the less I started to like it,\u000amay be I know the story too very well. Maybe, I am finding fault with\u000areasons of a prison escape done too trivially, by crawling in gutter\u000afor 500 yards or by creating a hole in the room. Or maybe, I think that\u000aAndy was just too easy and too casual on what he did. These are all my\u000aown reasons that put me down each time, I see this. Yet this has a good\u000aplace in my memory and heart for I see this, just because there is\u000ahope, and HOPE IS A GOOD THING. I just love the dialogs of this film\u000aand thanks to Stephen King and Frank Darabont for that.It's a 4/5 for a movie that may not be the best in my view yet is a\u000agood one to be watching. Go listen dialogs like 'you get busy living or\u000ayou get busy dying'. They are like music to ears.\u000a

V\u000aTo anyone that says Forrest Gump was the best movie then you are\u000ainsane. The Shawshank Redemption is the best movie I have ever watch.\u000aIt doesn't have any problems whatsoever. While Morgan Freeman takes\u000amost of the attention, Tim Robbins was absolutely incredible. The\u000aMovies overall message is inspiring and is one that will truly make you\u000asmile. The movie is long but it is just the length that it needs to be\u000aand won't bother you. What sets this movie apart though is the acting.\u000aThe acting was on a level I don't think we have seen since. The movie\u000ais one of the best of all time and I recommend it to anyone who wants a\u000agood story\u000a

V\u000aThe Shawshank Redemption is perhaps one of the most well thought out\u000aand intricate movies of its time. Released in 1994 The Shankshank\u000aRedemption stars Andy Dufresne played by Tim Robbins along side Ellis\u000aBoyd 'Red' Redding played by Morgan Freeman. When Andy is convicted of\u000adouble homicide he is sent to live out his days under Wardon Norton in\u000aa small imaginary town in Maine. To say the least Andy makes the most\u000aof his life on the inside. . Andy with his sly smile and cleaver\u000atactics weaves himself deep into the prisons web of secrets and lies,\u000abut the prison is not the only thing hiding secrets. The secrets that\u000aare held in books that Andy keeps for the warden are nothing compared\u000ato the secrets the lie behind the walls of Andy's very own cell. This\u000amovie is so good it is hard to describe in words. It is truly amazing\u000ahow you pull for each and every character despite their questionable\u000apasts. This movie will have you pulling for convicted felons in a way\u000ayou never imaged you could. From beginning to end this story brings you\u000aback in time right inside those cinder-block walls. It brings you\u000athrough the friendship, tragedy and ultimately the redemption of Andy\u000aDufrane.\u000a

After a quick conviction, Andy\u000afinds himself serving a life sentence at Shawshank prison, with no hope\u000aof parole. He exists in this prison only in appearance, keeping his\u000amind free from the drab walls around him. His ability to do this\u000aresults in the gaining of respect from his fellow inmates, but most of\u000aall from Ellis Redding. Andy escapes in the end by digging a hole through the wall, morgan\u000afreeman is let free after serving 40 years in prison.Ellis, commonly referred to as Red, finds gainful use of his\u000aentrepreneurial spirit within the drab walls of Shawshank by dealing in\u000acontraband and commodities rare to the confines of prison. Andy's\u000ademeanor and undeniable sense of hope causes Red to take a deeper look\u000aat himself, and the world around him.

V\u000aI swear this movie was narrated by God, and by God I mean Morgan\u000aFreeman. When I found out Shawshank Redemption was a movie based off a\u000aStephen King book, I expected a creepy horror movie, sort of like The\u000aShinning. Needless to say, I was pleasantly surprised. Tim Robbins,\u000aMorgan Freeman, and the rest of the cast deliver in one of the greatest\u000afilms ever made in history, at least according to IMDb, it was ranked\u000anumber one. So how does one review possibly the best movie ever made?The first time I watched Shawshank Redemption I wasn't really\u000aimpressed, but when I saw it ranked atop the leader board on IMDb, I\u000awatched it again, and I agreed with its place. This movie was\u000aabsolutely fantastic. The story flows and connects really well. The\u000acharacters are lovable and important to the overall story and by the\u000aend it made me just go, "wow that was awesome." This is a story of a man named Andy Dufresne who was convicted for the\u000amurder of his wife and the man who she had an affair with. When\u000aDufresne arrives in Shawshank he keeps a low profile but struggles with\u000awhat one would call normal prison problems. He then uses his\u000aintelligence of the business world to get on the good side of the\u000aguards and the warden. He makes the warden really wealthy and prison\u000alife becomes simpler. Then the story develops from there and it is\u000arather complex, but I won't give too much away.I have to start with a few flaws I saw in this movie. The story was a\u000abit slow with a lot of scenes or stories within the major story taking\u000aplace. In the beginning Andy had problems with the perverts of the\u000aprison, or Andy playing the music over the speakers of the prison etc.\u000aA few of these stories were pointless and just made me think, "Why?"\u000aSome were definitely amusing but it is only a small gripe. Maybe if I\u000awatch it again I will appreciate them more, but for now it just dragged\u000athe story if you ask me. A second problem, and this really bugged me,\u000awas the fact that Andy Dufresne entered the prison in 1947 and left in\u000a1966. That is a 19 year period. For a story to last 19 years is not a\u000aproblem at all, but the fact that the characters do not age annoyed me\u000aa lot. Morgan Freeman was supposed to be in his 40s at the start. Now\u000ait doesn't matter what decade it is in real life, Morgan Freeman always\u000alooks old and wise. And by the end, Freeman didn't really age at all.\u000aSure maybe a gray hair or two, but that was it. Dufresne looked the\u000aexact same and so did the Warden. Now some might ask why 19 year\u000astoryline but it makes sense if you actually see the movie. The\u000adirector could have easily added some wrinkles, white hair, something,\u000abut there was nothing and it didn't make the time span believable. When\u000aFreeman narrates it's 1966 I didn't really believe it. Little details\u000alike that are things I can overlook because it is such a fantastic\u000amovie but small things like that make an awesome movie a classic movie.The major strength of the movie, in my opinion, is the characters.\u000aDufresne, Red, the warden are the main characters so obviously they\u000awill have complexity and lovability, but even smaller characters like\u000aBrooks are still important. Brooks showed the prisoner who spends his\u000alife in prison and knows nothing else. He is a minor character but he\u000amade me think of prison life and prisoners themselves. When he got out\u000aof prison he didn't know what to do, he even wanted to stay. He had a\u000aminor role with a big impact. Even when he is gone he is remembered and\u000amentioned many times. I really don't remember his name but the character who was the\u000astereotypical 60s man and resembled Elvis was possibly the most\u000aimportant character of all (I'm just going to call him Elvis.). To save\u000aspoilers I will only hit the tip of the iceberg. The main story\u000aconnects with the minor stories told throughout the movie really well\u000abut the all seemed pointless until Elvis shows up in Shawshank. He\u000agives Dufresne what he needs and makes the warden put on his evil\u000apants. Basically, he is the turning point of the story and makes it\u000arelevant. If you saw the movie you will know exactly what I mean, and\u000aif you haven't then go see it so you aren't completely lost. Now the ending was absolutely phenomenal. Throughout the entire move I\u000awas thinking what the point was and where it was going, but by the end\u000ait is so surprising and personally I thought it was unexpected. It\u000amakes you appreciate the idea of storytelling and keeping an audience\u000ainterested and when I watched it a second time it was one of those\u000atimes when you think, "Why didn't I see this coming?" I love it when\u000amovie do that because it makes me think and if a movie makes me think\u000ait means I am interested and it does its job of being a good movie.Overall The Shawshank Redemption is a classic, possibly one of the best\u000aof all time. Do I think it deserves number one on IMDb's list? No,\u000aabsolutely not but it should be in the top 10. A bit of a slow start to\u000aan amazing story that connects really well, a cast of characters\u000aportrayed in depth and detail, and an ending that will possibly blow\u000ayour mind all form together to form on of, but not the best, movie of\u000aall time and without a shadow of a doubt gets the WillyT seal of\u000aapproval. See this movie ASAP.\u000a

V\u000aThis has been one of my favorite movies since I saw it originally in\u000athe theater in late 1994, as well as being one of my favorite Stephen\u000aKing stories (released as part of "Different Seasons" in 1982 and\u000asubtitled "Hope Springs Eternal"). Why this movie/story has such an\u000aeffect on me is because it represents hope in the face of incredible\u000aodds and it is one I watch whenever I feel like I have lost hope in\u000ahumankind. All of the elements that make excellent motion picture\u000aentertainment are here - stunning cinematography, beautiful and\u000auplifting music, enthralling and gripping story, and talented acting by\u000aall those selected for the roles. Frank Darabont also deserves credit\u000afor meshing all of these elements into an unforgettable experience that\u000aI never tire of. Perhaps the most memorable line in the movie is\u000auttered by Morgan Freeman ("Red") - "Get busy living, or get busy\u000adying" - and how it applies to life in general.\u000a

V\u000aSuphie W. 9/13/2012The Shawshank Redemption Movie Review Though I haven't seen this film\u000asince the year of 2004, (it came out in 1994), I seriously remember\u000abeing moved by it. I remember, quite vividly and with a pleasant vibe,\u000ahow moved my friend and I genuinely felt when we first watched it\u000atogether. These were in the days when Blockbuster was still around and\u000awhen it was more monetarily feasible as well as logical to go out to\u000ayour local movie store and rent a movie to watch with your friend; this\u000awas, with all due respect, before the current and giant economic\u000amelt-down that we are all experiencing. So, to set the scene and mood\u000aof the period in which we watched this film for the first time, the\u000acandles were lit, and my friend and I were seated eating gummy bears,\u000aand we stayed up and watched that sucker into the wee hours of the\u000amorning, cat-sitting. The economy was better, then, for sure, we all\u000aknow, but, we were having a hell of a time (now my friend is away,\u000ateaching English abroad, in Korea, soon to retire there, though; she's\u000ahad enough of it, as the lifestyle and the culture were just generally\u000agetting on her nerves, and she felt she had achieved what she wanted).\u000aWell, basically, the Shawshank Redemption is all about solitary\u000aconfinement in a small, insulated, but high-security prison in\u000amiddle-to-Southern Ohio, set in the '50s. Morgan Freeman and his white\u000acounterpart in the film (race was a factor back then), partner up to\u000agive each other moral support and courage during a very tough time for\u000athem both. The part that struck me most about this film, though, was\u000athat Tim Robbins, or, the character played by Tim Robbins, was put into\u000asolitary confinement, where food was shoved in his little cell in an\u000aunsanitary manner, and he was treated, as the proverb or saying goes,\u000alike a dog; and where he couldn't see nor hear from anyone for a long,\u000along time; it was verifiable torture. In addition, Morgan Freeman, who\u000aplays someone who is, like Tim Robbins, on the death row, plays your\u000aaverage cool-cat gentleman who was convicted for the murdering of his\u000awife or something, but who claims he didn't do it. There are many\u000acafeteria scenes where the two bond joyously over their own jokes and\u000ajiving, and where they eventually become better friends. Basically, the\u000atwo bond over their common suffering, and help each other through their\u000asorrow. Indeed, Bob Gunton also plays in the film, a man who plays the\u000ajail-owner, or something. He appears, in real life, to be much older\u000athan either Robbins or Freeman, born in October of 1959, and 1937,\u000arespectively. Robbins notably graduated with honors from the drama\u000aprogram of UCLA in 1981, then went on to do other great things, such as\u000aforming the Actor's Gang Theatre Group, which expressed radical\u000apolitical views as seen through a European lens. In addition, Robbins\u000ahas received many dramatic awards, and continues to do sporadic work in\u000afilm. Freeman, of course, is the mighty train who continues to do well\u000ain whatever he does, and is well-liked by all, really. Bob Gunton has a\u000atendency for playing strict, militaristic, authoritarian roles when it\u000acomes to his film-work, and he plays the role in the notable movie of\u000aThe Shawshank Redemption. There are several intense scenes in the\u000amovie, The Shawshank Redemption, and many of them include the showing\u000aof the intense pain of both Freeman and Robbins, as they elude their\u000agrief. Robbins, in particular can't take the pain of being "locked-up"\u000aso to speak and often shouts, screams intensely out of frustration with\u000ahaving no one to talk to, and out of mental and emotional pain. Morgan\u000aFreeman notably cries, which is all the more pitiful as one sees his\u000aweary countenance.\u000a

V\u000aOne just cannot describe excellence of this movie. Movies are generally\u000aconsidered classics based on - Story/Screenplay - Direction -\u000aPerformances - Overall FilmThis is one movie that probably musters a 7-8/10 in the top-3\u000acategories ... However the Overall Film is so overwhelming that it\u000ascores 11 out of 10. Just like good wine, it just feels a better movie\u000aevery time you watch it.How many movies have been made in the 100+ years of cinema that can\u000aever boost of such an impact!!! The Godfather (both 1 & 2) is surely\u000a9.5-10/10 in the top-3 categories; but misses the mark considerably as\u000aan Overall Film (maybe 7.5-8/10).Just like popular Nursery Rhymes, age-old Fairytale stories, music from\u000aFrank Sinatra, Elvis Presley & Michael Jackson - One never gets bored\u000awatching The Shawshank Redemption again & again & again ... A Film For The Generations !!!\u000a

V\u000aAt first glance, tis may seem like your typical "Tale-from-the-past"\u000astory. You've got Morgan Freeman narrating a a story, so it's got to be\u000agood right? Well, the truth is, it is. Reluctant at first, I was\u000aswiftly charmed by this story of mans struggle with life's cruelty. Tim\u000aRobbin's Character simply gets pummeled by life, but continues to keep\u000ahis mind set on the hope. It's this message that captivated me. Despite\u000athe typical fairytale ending, it's the journey to that ending that\u000amakes this film great.The characters, have to face some of the hardest obstacles that life\u000acould throw at one person. Yet, despite the odds, they somehow are able\u000ato not only enjoy what little glimmer of light they have, but keep hope\u000aalive. This is something that was genuinely charming about this film.\u000aIn today's cynical society, a reminder of hope, and the reassurance\u000athat some times, the good guy does pull it off, is something many\u000amovies lack.Now, the film itself isn't bright or happy, in fact it's the complete\u000aopposite. Dark lighting, tight shots, and rough settings are what give\u000athe film it's harsh reminder that life isn't just a walk in the park.\u000aBut with charming, lovable characters, and novel-like writing give this\u000afilm a balance that simply makes it irresistible.This film is a must see classic. Has very mature content, not suitable\u000afor children.\u000a

V\u000aShawshank Redemption is an amazing story about a prison break planned\u000aby Andy, and the journey it took to achieve his plan and a excellent\u000amovie. It is an amazing movie , i seen it four times already in past\u000afew years. Andy is one of my favorite characters in movie because of\u000ahis polite, educated and cunning mind. The plan is a master escape plan\u000aand live his life they way he want it to be.takes the "innocent man in\u000aprison" theme and bends it at a different angle.Andy Dufresne, wrongly\u000aconvicted of murdering his wife and her lover, finds the strength not\u000aonly to change himself, but to bring hope to those around him in\u000aShawshank Prison. This inspiring story is interwoven with a soundtrack\u000awhich invokes every emotion, from haunting and chilling, to stirring\u000aand beautiful. When you go to see a movie and it touches you with its\u000apoetry, music, and its atmosphere, and leaves you with a sense of\u000avictorious satisfaction, it is a triumph. And it is not necessarily\u000aredemption for the actual crimes you might have committed, but it is\u000aredemption for the way you have lived your life. What emerges can only\u000abe called a magnificently piece of art. This is what movies were meant\u000ato be.\u000a

V\u000a*Contain Spoilers*The Shawshank Redemption (1994) Director - Frank Darabont\u000aCinematographer  Roger Deakins Writers  Stephen King and Frank\u000aDarabont Editor  Richard Francis-BruceFavorite Quote: "Hope is a good thing and good things never die." The\u000aShawshank Redemption is about time, patience, hope and loyalty. In\u000a1946, a banker named Andy Dufresne (protagonist) is convicted of a\u000adouble murder, even though he stubbornly proclaims his innocence. He's\u000asentenced to a life term at the Shawshank State Prison in Maine, where\u000aanother lifer, Ellis "Red" Redding, picks him as the new recruit. The\u000afirst part of the film deals with Andy, Red and their group of friends\u000adealing with prison life.Andy wants to be a freeman. He regrets his past and wants to move on\u000awith a new life and memories. But the ugly realities of prison life are\u000aquickly introduced to Andy. A corrupt warden, sadistic guards led by\u000aCapt. Byron Hadley and inmates who are little better than animals,\u000awilling to use rape or beatings to insure their dominance. But Andy\u000adoes not crack. He has the hope of the truly innocent, which (together\u000awith his smarts) allow him to prevail behind bars. He uses his banking\u000askills to win favor with the warden and the guards, doing the books for\u000aNorton's illegal business schemes and keeping an eye on the investments\u000aof most of the prison staff. In exchange, he is able to improve the\u000aprison library and bring some dignity and respect back to many of the\u000ainmates, including Red.After almost a two decade stay, in 1966, Andy Dufresne escapes the\u000aShawshank prison by tunneling through the wall with a rock hammer worn\u000adown to the nub. He sets off to a new country for a new life and is\u000alater accompanied by his prison mate Red.Andy Duresne is a man of hope. He is a smart person and a loyal friend.\u000aThe Shawshank Redemption is the journey of redemption of Andy and his\u000afellow convicts. Redemption is found in many ways, by many characters,\u000aeven by a bird named Jake. It's a story portraying the corruption and\u000apolitics in a prison and the transformation of an investment banker to\u000aa smart con. It shows how the weak and innocent protagonist, who is\u000aoften bullied and tortured during his early stay in prison, adapts and\u000achanges himself with the situation and out smarts the guards and warden\u000ato run away with their illegal money and starts a new life.Review By  Mayank Bhattacharya\u000a

V\u000aWhen I first discovered IMDb I was curious on knowing the number 1 in\u000athe top 250. I saw Shawshank at 1, and I was very mad that it wasn't\u000aThe Godfather. So then I downloaded it on my Mac. Me, my mother and\u000asister saw it together. After we watched it. I felt something inside me changed. My vision of\u000athe world changed from negative, to positive. I felt hope. The acting was great, It had great dialogs, smart representation of the\u000aWarden and Andy's relationship, carefully explained story, and an\u000aawesome ending. I don't see any reason why you should hate it!So then I decided to watch it again, and I could honestly say that the\u000amore you watch it, the more you'll like it! It makes you wanna go out\u000aon a rainy day and spread your arms out wide as if you yourself escaped\u000afrom prison!I really want everyone to see this movie. So that when we look at a\u000acriminal... We could see them as a person who can change the world for\u000athe better.\u000a

V\u000aAnyone who has not watched this movie needs to. Morgan Freeman's role\u000areally defined my generation. His performance as "Red" was probably the\u000abest I've ever seen.I'm not a big Tim Robbins fan, in fact this role is the only one I\u000alike, maybe Bull Durham...but not on this level. Andy Dufrane, really\u000amakes the best of what would simply drive most of us to the brink of\u000ainsanity. He did it because he found friends. Which did become his\u000afamily.Andy was a difficult man to know, he was so smart so intelligent. Even\u000aRed his friend who was telling the story didn't really seem to\u000aunderstand him, at least until the end. I love it how Andy had to put\u000ahimself into positions to make the prison is own. He got himself out of\u000aa bad situation by befriending his enemies, and then when the time was\u000aright, taking them out. While in their minds they were using Andy for\u000atheir benefits, but Andy knew he used them...brilliant.These two friends in a sense had their own lives defined by their\u000afriendship. How many people can say that have ever had a friend like\u000athat? I hope that in the next 20 years my best friend, will have help\u000adefine me.The best thing about this movie, is how simple they made it. "Get Busy\u000aLivin' or get busy dyin." That in and of itself is advice we all need,\u000aespecially when work or school seems to dictate our routines.My advice watch this movie. It is the best of the last 50 years.\u000aPeriod.\u000a

V\u000aThis movie is about the former banker who was falsely imprisoned. He\u000awas suspected of murder (As you can see in the trailer). This movie\u000adescribes the mind of prisoners, and situations in prison.Prisoners, especially those who get life imprisonment, are not able to\u000alive normally. They will get crazy because there's no hope for them.\u000aEven if they are able to get paroled, they can't find hope in their new\u000alife. For them, the life in prison is everything. They don't know how\u000athey live outside. But the man, Andy (main character) was different. He\u000anever give up hope. Hope often cut us. If we don't have hope, we don't\u000aget hurt. If we expect nothing, we don't have to get disappointed.\u000aPrisoners know this, and try not to have hope. But he try to keep it.\u000aHis attitude gave me strong message. Also this movie tells us how human lights are ignored in the prison.\u000aSome people might think it's natural that prisoners don't have human\u000aright. They don't deserve for it. But what if there are some prisoners\u000awho are falsely imprisoned and are innocent? I watched this movie\u000athinking of the human rights of criminals and how warden should treat\u000athem. This is written by Stephen King, and his story is so beautiful. Also\u000aactors are great. I recommend this movie to everyone!\u000a

V\u000aTim Robbins, Morgan Freeman, Bob Gunton, William Sadler, James Whitmore\u000aand Clancy Brown star in this 1994 drama based on Stephen King's short\u000astory, "Rita Hayworth and Shawshank Redemption." This tells of\u000amild-mannered Banker, Andy Dufresne (Robbins) who is framed for\u000amurdering his wife and her lover. He's sent to New England prison,\u000aShawshank where he befriends convicted murderer, Ellis Redding aka\u000a"Red" (Freeman). Andy also puts up with corrupt Warden, Samuel Norton\u000a(Gunton) and his Guard Captain, Byron Hadley (Brown). Andy doesn't let\u000athem or the prison get the best of him because he has hope keeping him\u000agoing. Sadler (Die Hard 2) plays prison inmate, Haywood who is friends\u000awith Red and Andy and the late, Whitmore (Psycho) plays their other\u000afriend, Brooks. I love this film, Robbins and Freeman are terrific in\u000ait and together, the rest of the cast is good as well and Thomas\u000aNewman's score is excellent. This is the film that always gives us hope\u000aand I highly recommend it.\u000a

V\u000aThe reason this movie is ranked number one is that it is a tale of\u000ahope. It's the story of a man, who claims to be innocent, on the inside\u000aof a jail. We witness the cruelties. We witness the sadness. We witness\u000athe unforgivable corruption. We never know what Andy is thinking. We\u000asee him through the other characters, through their thoughts. Mostly\u000athrough Morgan Freeman's character, who narrates the film. His\u000aportrayal of his character is more than successfully satisfying. He\u000anails it, as he always does. They build real characters who go through\u000areal changes, something people can relate to. I'm trying to not reveal\u000aany of the plot. The plot is not complex, or not overly complex I\u000ashould say. It will be easy to follow as long as you start at the\u000abeginning. It's the way to movie presents it, the way it reveals itself\u000ato the audience is what makes it so brilliant. The plot turns are\u000aunexpected. I think that what makes this movie so great is that. The\u000away it keeps you interested, keeps you unprepared. It truly makes you\u000afeel for the characters though they're inside a prison. It shows how\u000afragile the situation is on the inside, for all of them.\u000a

V\u000aEven though the number of fantastic reviews overpowers the bad reviews\u000aI would like to challenge the bad. These "critics" call this movie\u000aboring, stereotypical, and not believable. Their ratings, 1 out of 10,\u000aare based on an overreaction in order to draw attention to themselves.\u000aThese ratings don't have merit and quite frankly are immature. For\u000astarters, this movie is based around a theme that's both controversial\u000aand important. The premise of falsely convicting someone to life in\u000aprison or capital punishment is as real and as touchy of a subject that\u000ayou can get. It has been a major problem in society since the beginning\u000aof law and occurs more frequently then anyone would like to admit or\u000aeven think about. So already we have a movie that is thought-provoking,\u000arelevant, and powerful. Then you get Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman, in\u000atheir prime, give career and industry altering performances. Then the\u000amovie goes above and beyond ALL others when the universal themes of\u000afear, friendship, and hope are exquisitely baked into the plot. Unlike\u000amost movies, the final outcome isn't always apparent and is definitely\u000anot given up easily. The movie is purposely stretched out in order to\u000acreate an emotional connection. Shawshank understands that whenever\u000asomething is quickly and easily given up it won't be very thought\u000aprovoking. Additionally, Shawshank understands it is a fictional story\u000aand that key embellishments are vital to any influential story.\u000aTherefore, this movie allows the viewer to get emotionally committed so\u000athat you walk away feeling affected.\u000a

V\u000aHonestly, I have never heard of a movie that was so captivating and\u000apowerful to watch. The Shawshank Redemption stars Tim Robbins as a\u000abaker who is accused in murdering his wife but denies it. Morgan\u000aFreeman plays a man who has been in the Shawshank prison for many years\u000aand has given up on hope and is fighting to get out of prison by the\u000aparole hearings in the movie. Lastly, you have Bob Gunton from Ace\u000aVentura When Nature Calls playing a warren that you would think to\u000atrust but is actually the opposite. I wont go further into describing\u000athe movie because it is very difficult to explain the whole premise and\u000athe characters. What I can say is that the plot is brilliantly paced\u000aand full of twists and turns and will keep you on the edge of your\u000aseat. I really appreciated the tone of this film having a grim, dark\u000ableak side of Shawshank prison and the light uplifting colors outside\u000aof the prison. But, enough of the cinematography how was the acting?\u000aWithout a doubt, the acting in this film was absolutely wonderful!\u000aMorgan Freeman does his voice-overs with a very poetic edge and makes\u000athe narration very entertaining. I really love Morgan Freeman's\u000avoice-overs since it shows his fantastic acting. Tim Robbins is very\u000alikable as a guy feeling that he has been framed and is dying to escape\u000athe prison. But, whats different from The Great Escape ,which is\u000aanother prison escape movie, is that you don't know how he is going to\u000aescape. The way he does is absolute sheer genius! All the characters\u000aare very likable including the best supporting character in this movie\u000athat everyone can feel sympathy for. Brookes is an very complex\u000acharacter that I felt attached to when he left prison on parole. But, I\u000awont spoil the rest of the movie because you must go see it for\u000ayourself! You will not be disappointed! This is one of Frank Durabont's\u000amasterpieces that would have never happened without the genius writer\u000aSTEPHEN KING!!!P.S. This movie has one of the if not the best ending I have ever seen\u000asince it touches your heart!\u000a

V\u000aOf all the prison movies I have ever seen, The Shawshank Redemption is\u000aeasily the best of them all. And of all the movies based on Stephen\u000aKing's novels and novellas, this is the best adaptation. It was a shame\u000ait did not win any of the Oscars it was nominated for. I think it is\u000aone of the best movies to be made in so many years in cinematic\u000ahistory. It gives you insight on what life would be like if you were in\u000aprison. This movie focuses on a man sent to prison for the murder of\u000ahis wife and her lover, which he did not commit. Tim Robbins is one of\u000athe most talented actors around. He plays his role with a lot of heart,\u000asoul and conviction. His best film role to date. Morgan Freeman is also\u000avery talented, he also played his role with a lot of heart, soul and\u000aand conviction. This is also his best film role to date. And finally\u000ahands off to Bill Gunton for his role as the wicked prison warden. His\u000acharacter is an absolute bad ass. The Shawshank Redemption is a true\u000amasterpiece.\u000a

V\u000aI will start with a basic summary:This movie starts out with a banker(Tim Robbins) who supposedly killed\u000ahis wife and her lover while drunk. This led to a conviction and prison\u000asentence. Most of the story takes place in this prison, Shawshank. Tim\u000aRobbins and Morgan Freeman are the main characters, who become best\u000afriends who use their friendship as a means to escape from the hell of\u000aprison and the devil in their warden. Tim (Andy), a brilliant man, manages to make a slightly better prison\u000alife for himself and his fellow inmates by helping out the warden with\u000abasic office things. However, this was not enough for him. He need to\u000aescape, and escape he did in the most spectacular way. Now, I will give my opinion on the film:This film is something that you should devote time to watching when you\u000ahave no interruptions. Turn off your cellphone and unplug your home\u000aphone before watching it because the greatness of this film is\u000asomething that shouldn't be interrupted. The story line is perfect. The\u000aacting is perfect. The characters are so deep and gripping. The setting\u000ais excellent. If you have money, I would definitely recommend that you\u000abuy this in blu-ray (if you have blu-ray player) and connect it to a\u000asurround sound system, because you will want to hear every spoken word,\u000aevery fallen leaf, every gust of wind, every detail.This is one of about only 5 movies that I give a solid 10 stars.\u000a

V\u000aI should say that usually I'm not much into drama. But the beauty of\u000aThe Shawshank Redemption magically forced me into watching the whole\u000afilm three times over the years.Its the kind of movie that is so\u000apowerful and realistic you become glued to your seat until the end. The\u000atwist at the end gave the movie a perfect finish without affecting the\u000afine gist of the whole movie. Shawshank Redemption teaches us, improves\u000aour feelings about the world and changes our expectations about 'luck'.Morgan Freeman and Tim Robbins deliver their best performance to date.\u000aIf Tom Hank's movie Forrest Gump was not made in the same year, this\u000awould most certainly be the winner of the 67th academy awards.\u000a

V\u000aThe story opens with a non intelligent man who is committed to make a\u000acrime, in the mid of 19th century. The story is furnished with the\u000asolid voice of Mr.Morgan Freeman who narrates the story throughout the\u000amovie. Though the story has a very slow pace which makes it a bit\u000aboring, it has a fine twist in the end which clears all the memory of\u000athat boring bit , to turn in an interesting end. The concept of the\u000amovies which works out to be a backbone of the story is that the\u000aprominence of intelligence along with the persistent effort which\u000abrings success to any man. The Director Mr. Frank brings out three\u000ainteresting characters Boyd,Andy and Brooks who contrasts each other in\u000atheir approach to life. Brooks in spite of the spending nearly half of\u000ahis life in prison fails to make an identity of his own,while Andy\u000atries to make his identity by giving some risks, while the Boyd plays\u000asafe to join the winner. The resources were available to all the\u000aprisoners at equal band, but the approach of each individual made a\u000adifference. The library project, and chess pawns carving symbolizes the\u000away the Andy was creative. Brooks had already lost his "hope" in\u000alife(Symbolized by crow liberated by the way he is liberated from the\u000aprison). Andy always believing in himself and Boyd neither there nor\u000ahere with both the intentions. The effort of twenty years of Andy gets\u000ahim the victory the way he expected causing enough damage to the one\u000awho dominated him (Norton) for twenty years. The director clearly\u000aconveys the message "Hope is a good thing and Good thing never dies".\u000aHis judgment cometh and that right soon.\u000a

V\u000aYes. No need to watch this movie, instead just play it on DVD, close\u000ayour eyes and just listen to Morgan Freeman's narration of a prison\u000aLife, Hope, Friendship and the days in Shawshank. Every important move in this movie is described by Morgan and his voice\u000ais such a plus that it lift the movie to next level.In a scene, where the entrance of the prison tower was shown in the top\u000aangle, it shows the world in to which the prisoners are entering. It is\u000aa sample scene where the director relied on cameraman to convey the\u000amessage instead of 10 line dialog.Everyone expects Morgan and Tim to become friends after all both of\u000athem are big actors. It is predictable. But the way the friendship\u000adevelops is truly amazing screenplay.Many sub-plots, people with different attitude were shown in the movie.\u000aNot all of them are good people. But most of the characters are in\u000atransformation phase where they repent for their mistakes.Poetic scene ? Many scenes are there. But the one in which Morgan, Tim\u000aand others drink beer at the top of the roof of one of the building and\u000athe way Morgan narrates the scene.. Amazing...It contains a twist which is a ingredient for any thriller movie. Yet\u000athat brilliant scene is so subtle that everyone appreciate.Will there be any other movie in our life time where it can be simple\u000ayet be so powerful and heart touching ?. Doubt we will see such a movie\u000asoon.As many said before, don't rent it.. instead buy this movie and keep it\u000asafe for next generation to see this movie..Hats off to Morgan, Tim and everyone who acted in this master piece...\u000a

V\u000aShawshank Redemption ! probably the most watched, the most liked movie\u000aof its time and rightly so. The plot flows like a poetry, making the\u000aexperience of watching surreal.A young banker(Tim Robbins)is being framed for the alleged murder for\u000ahis wife. The man pleads innocent but the court thinks otherwise and is\u000agiven a long sentence in the jail and the name of the jail is\u000aShawshank. The man is completely unassuming and brilliant. Taking\u000asometime to get adjusted to the jail environment, he befriends many in\u000athe jail. The main one is Reed (Morgan Freeman)who smuggles cigars and\u000aother necessary things to the jail inmates.The jail warden is Norton (Bob Gunton) who is a bible loving, strict\u000aperson who hoards and involved in money laundering. Noticing the talent\u000aof the banker, he uses the banker's knowledge to launder the money.\u000aMeanwhile,a young guy is jailed for a petty crime and he confides to\u000aTim Robbins something that could help him to prove his innocence. But\u000athe warden doesn't approve of it and he gets the young man killed.On one fine day, Tim Robbins suddenly escapes from the citadel of\u000aShawshank. How he planned it and the execution of it forms the next\u000apart of the movie.The movie is perhaps the best prison break movie ever done. Stephen\u000aKing deserves credit for this wonderful, intelligent story and equally\u000awonderful characterization,the director of the movie for his surreal\u000acreation of the jail environment and actors for their brilliant\u000aperformances. The movie could have been edited by a few minutes and\u000acould have been made well within 2 hours. That fact could be overlooked\u000agiven the thrill,entertainment the movie provides.\u000a

V\u000aTherecare a lot of movies where plot takes place in a prison, with\u000a'innocent' in-mates, cruel warden and a breathtaking escape but I'm\u000aalmost sure that the director wanted to pay tribute to Bogart& Bacall's\u000aDark Passage. There are some particular elements in the plot that\u000aresemble the 50 years old film such as; the ending scene on a south\u000aAmerican Pacific beach (here Mexico then it was Peru), a bus ride thru\u000athe Mexican border, an innocent fugitive etc. (Morgan Feeeman of course\u000ais not Bacall...ha ha ).The rest of the story, or better to say almost\u000aall of it is an entirely different . Tim Robins and M.F work together\u000awith harmony , even pouring some humor into the gloomy atmosphere of\u000athe Shawshank prison.\u000a

V\u000aWe bought a piece of land. It was embarrassingly overgrown in weeds. It\u000ahad trash deposited on it. We used swingblades to chop through the\u000agrowth to get down to the ground. One day as I was swinging, a man walking down the road said, "You\u000abought a bunch of weeds." It was true, but they were my bunch of weeds.\u000aI kept working. It's like there was nothing beautiful to see, but I saw\u000ait - I could see beauty, when there was no beauty there to see; and,\u000ayet, there was beauty there to see, it just was unseen to most eyes -\u000abut it was there.As spring came, something else came - daffodils. They were everywhere;\u000avibrant yellow on green stems; life amongst death; beauty amongst ruin.\u000aNature itself was saying there is hope; life was springing back with\u000adeath and ruin its backdrop. Chickweed flourished everywhere; lush green, much greener than grass.\u000aThe ground was a blanket of green; the lushest weed that had ever\u000abrought such pleasure to my eye. It flourishes in the spring, it dies\u000aout in the summer, and reappears in the fall. Its like waiting for a\u000afriend to come, then go, only to come again."The Shawshank Redemption" reminded me of such hope and life amongst\u000adespair and death. Of good and evil, with awfulness many times seeking\u000ato overcome goodness and put it out, only to see goodness, even if\u000abrought to death, shine through the darkness.A tagline for this movie says, "Fear can hold you prisoner, hope can\u000aset you free." Brooks hanged himself; Red embraced hope. I thought of\u000aRevelation 21:8 where it says, "But the fearful, and unbelieving, and\u000athe abominable, and murderers, and whoremongers, and sorcerers, and\u000aidolaters, and all liars, shall have their part in the lake which\u000aburneth with fire and brimstone: which is the second death." The first\u000akind of person mentioned is the fearful. I thought of Brooks, he had a\u000achance at life - but, he chose death. He was fearful. There will be those who enter (chose) eternal death because they were\u000afearful. The prison doors have been opened, they are told they can have\u000aliberty and freedom, and yet, like Brooks, fear holds them prisoners to\u000adeath; they seal their own death, they enter eternal death.Red came to the same place as Brooks, yet, he made a different\u000adecision; he chose the hope set before him.Red, along with Andy, enjoyed their paradise. They chose to hope, and\u000ato follow that hope; that hope led them into life.As for our land, that "bunch of weeds" to the man walking by, it too\u000ahas followed hope into life. People now say, "You sure got it looking\u000agood." We even had a land speculator contact us - wanting to buy our\u000aland. She ain't for sale. I may not be able to fully accomplish my hope on\u000athat land in my lifetime - but, I can hope. Every day, I can hope.\u000aEvery spring, I can see the daffodils come back after winter. I can see\u000athe lush green chickweed come and go and come again. Andy and Red had a boat and the Pacific Ocean.A plastic Wal-mart chair under the shade of the trees, with the\u000aseemingly ever-present, gentle breeze is my Pacific Ocean.Hope can set you free.\u000a

V\u000aIt wasn't even my idea. It was a female friends idea. I hadn't read any\u000areviews. So i went and i watched it. And i thought it was quite a\u000apleasant, well-made film. I didn't think it was the best film ever\u000amade. It was obviously different to your average Hollywood Blockbuster\u000a(the same year's Pulp Fiction it is not!)- slow paced with a director\u000ahappy not to rush things.And here we are nearly 20 years later and it's a lot of people's\u000afavourite film. It's not my favourite film but it's grown on me and\u000ai've been forced to reappraise it. And now i think it's a lovely film,\u000alovingly made and when you've had enough of aliens blowing up The\u000aWhitehouse, scantily clad students dancing and wise-cracking cops\u000ashooting everything insight this is the antidote and really there\u000ashould be more films made like this. It puts the "good" in "feel good\u000amovie".\u000a

Superb editing\u000a& screenplay. Kudos to the entire team. Movie is 20 years old and\u000alooking fresh even one. Friendship is another keyword that has been\u000aincorporated at the right amount. I could compare Life is beautiful\u000amovie with this one. It also inspired me to have the confidence at all\u000atime. This is one of my favorite movie of all time ..\u000a

V\u000aTwo thousand four hundred and five IMDb users have bothered to write a\u000areview of this movie. I read all of them and did not find a bad one. Of\u000acourse I didn't! I had not seen the movie and that is true. Every\u000asingle one of my friends and acquaintances has, and not surprisingly,\u000arecommended it with the highest of praise. The fact that I had not did\u000aput into question my claim to be a movie lover. Now that I have, I\u000aadmit it serves me right to have been questioned so.It is a damn good movie for all the reasons everyone wrote in their\u000areviews and why critics also raved about it. I have no excuse for not\u000awatching it before other than my prejudice toward any movie having to\u000ado with jails, the prison life etc..Halfway into the movie, I was not convinced my prejudice about movies\u000adealing in any way with prison would change, but the acting was good\u000aenough to keep me going. I was very happy with the direction this movie\u000atook, especially with the ending. Not since "The Birdman from Alcatraz"\u000aand Escape from Alcatraz have I enjoyed a movie that has prison as the\u000asetting; I don't expect it will soon either since my phobia with that\u000ais not going away soon. Finally, having seen Shawshank, I can now have\u000aan intelligent conversation about movies with friends and acquaintances\u000awithout risking admonition for my failing to see the movie. Anybody\u000athat hasn't seen it yet and claims some knowledge of movies deserves,\u000aas I did, to be castigated. I've made my peace with the matter and I'm\u000amoving on.\u000a

V\u000aQuite simply amazing.This film makes you question yourself, authority, friendship and\u000ainjustice all at once. The quality of the acting is brilliant, and what\u000aa storyline. Although set in the past it is a storyline that could run\u000afor centuries. I have watched this film probably 10-15 times and each\u000atime enjoy it as much as the last. An easy watch, and although far\u000afetched is still believable somewhat. Absolute entertainment from start to finish, and on a relatively low\u000abudget. It just shows that a simple idea for a screenplay can be\u000aadapted into a classic. Many films fail when they make twists too\u000acomplicated, or use too many special effects. This film allows the\u000aviewer to make their own decisions but also gently pushes you into\u000amaking a connection with each and every character My favourite film by a country mile.\u000a

V\u000aA complete experience out of the box filled with the class of the\u000aGolden and Silver Age of Hollywood. Its music leaves one as entranced\u000aas at the end of an epic and its story line strikes one as odd as does\u000athe sight of originality in a commercial world. It makes sense that\u000aShawshank did poorly at the box office in its initial run because its\u000acommercial appeal is perhaps not as much as was that of Forrest Gump or\u000aLion King. But its brilliance outweighs both of those films and\u000ainstantly grabs one and reels one in. Soothing narration by the Sidney\u000aPoitier of the late 20th century and the all around nice guy persona\u000aprojected by Tim Robbins makes the film a high achiever any where and\u000aany time. Why this film wasn't sent in to Cannes escapes me. The best\u000apart about the film is that even after one has watched it and knows the\u000acomplete story, it seems as if the entire story does not necessarily\u000adepend upon the ending or the climax, every scene stands out on its\u000aown. The pacing of the film was what struck me as particularly\u000asurprising. I never once felt that a scene had been accelerated or had\u000abeen overly edited. The hand carved chess pieces, the acts of altruism,\u000athe escape and most of all, Marilyn Monroe elevate this film to\u000aanyone's BEST EVER list. I won't say its a classic yet though because\u000ait hasn't even been twenty years since it was released.\u000a

V\u000aWhat can you say about Shawshank Redemption? There's a reason it has a\u000a9.2/10 rating here on IMDb I guess. Indeed, this movie ties Forrest\u000aGump on my #1 all-time-favorite list.What would it feel like, to be thrown in prison for 30 years for\u000asomething you didn't do? Anyone who thinks it couldn't happen is blind.Many people might even commit suicide if it happened to them. Andy not\u000aonly survived, but thrived in a world few could describe as anything\u000abut "hell." He became friends with a guy who really was actually\u000aguilty.The other thing about this movie that was so awesome, was the great\u000aone-liners. "Get busy livin, or get busy dyin." The acting is\u000aspectacular; you "feel" like you're there in the prison, especially the\u000afirst night he's there and the guy start's crying next to him. Wow, so\u000apainful to watch.I read somewhere that in the book, Freeman's character was a red-headed\u000aIrish guy, and they thought it was funny to leave his name as Red in\u000athe movie. That's why he answers "Because I'm Irish" when Andy asks him\u000awhy they call him Red.This movie was simply amazing... and from Steven King no less! Crazy.-Tracy Milburn\u000a

V\u000aAfter a sobering experience in the prison, what would a person believe\u000aas the best thing in life ? This movie tells so much story asides from\u000athe drama that going on in the prison. Andy (Tim Robbins) is an accountant who's wife is cheating on him. She\u000agets her comeuppance when she gets killed by a thug during her affair.\u000aAndy is accused of the crime, and gets sentenced for life at Shaw Shank\u000aprison. There he meets Red (Morgan Freeman) who would become his life\u000along friend. Andy knows he's innocent, and won't give up to get the\u000afreedom that he deserves. He devises a long term plan that will\u000aeventually bring bombastic results to the prison and its people.Why would a movie about prisoners and life in prison ever make it to\u000athe top of so many people's best movie list ? Because it's about an\u000aunderdog hero that gets his goods in the end. It's about someone who\u000abelieves he's being mistreated, and through his genius not only devised\u000aa way out, but constructed a new life for himself. The irony, the\u000ahumor, and imbecility of society is all crammed into this fine drama.The finest drama ever to be captured on film. It would be a long time\u000abefore someone makes a better movie than this.\u000a

Great acting by both leads, Tim Robbins\u000aand Morgan Freeman. In fact, everyone acted well in this movie. The\u000adirection deserves standing ovation and Frank Darabont, the director\u000aalso deserves hats off for his very gripping screenplay. It is very\u000adifficult to maintain much interest of audience in same interior scenes\u000aif they keep repeating themselves but DOP has done a fine job too.

V\u000aThe Shawshank Redemption is an instant classic by far.This is probably\u000aone of the most greatest movies of all time.Tim Robbins did the role\u000atremendously.Morgan Freeman made the movie what it is today.I love this\u000amovie.Im telling you if you haven't seen this movie watch it right\u000anow.you will fall in love with the movie.The first time i saw this\u000amovie it almost brought tears to my eyes.The director Frank Darabont is\u000aa genius for this movie and we also have to thank Stephan King for\u000awriting the book.Both of those guys are amazing.please if you haven't\u000aseen the movie watch it, it will blow your mind.those who have seen\u000athis movie don't you agree with me?? This movie is great.\u000a

V\u000aAs a matter of rarity would it have ever happened, while u watch a\u000amovie u wish let this continue forever, let there be no end to the\u000astory. With its essence of hope, desire, honesty, purity, passion,\u000abrilliance and much more "Shawshank Redemption" is one such creation in\u000areel. It started with a question "whats so special about this movie to\u000atop IMDb". It ended with much than just an answer. It made me get up\u000afrom my bed, start my notebook and share my happiness with you all. I\u000ahave never done this before. To acclaim the screenplay, acting,\u000adirection would need more than just words of English dictionary. On a lighter note, be the best in what you are doing, you never know,\u000ait may become your savior one day. It is a must watch for everyone. Hope Against hope and life beyond\u000aboundaries are one of many points I take away from this movie. Before I\u000asign out, Frank Darabont, Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman take a bow.\u000a

V\u000aThe Shawshank Redemption released in 1994 in my opinion is one of the\u000abest movies I've seen in a long time. The movie has a great story and\u000aeven better characters. Tim Robbins plays Andy Dufresne a city banker,\u000awrongfully convicted of murdering his wife and her lover. He is sent to\u000aShawshank prison in 1947 and receives a double life sentence. Andy\u000aforms a friendship with "Red" (Morgan Freeman), the entrepreneur of the\u000ajail. Both men face many trial and tribulations while incarcerated. But\u000ain the end the only thing these two men have in the world are each\u000aother and hope, which to them is the only thing "the man" can't take\u000afrom them. The movie is full of great acting, with a theme of hope and\u000afriendship it illustrates human triumph over hardships. Nominated for 7\u000aOscars this movie was powerful in every way. What you will take away\u000afrom this movie in the 150 minutes will give you a lifetime of lessons\u000afrom the heart.\u000a

V\u000aThis slow paced movie gradually unfolds into a spectators' delight.\u000aMany things could have gone horribly wrong but the director did a\u000asplendid job.Morgan Freeman once again proved his mettle. But Tim Robbins was unable\u000ato do justice to his part. But hey! That's my point of view.But one thing made me glad and that is this film exhibited how HOPE can\u000abe a very beautiful thing albeit a dangerous one. Deprivation of the\u000ahope of being free. God! That is simply unnerving.The movie raised many questions. About how the legal system is not fool\u000aproof, how innocent men get mauled by the very thorns which were placed\u000ato protect them. Also being punished for a crime one didn't commit and\u000aliving in a hell for 2 decades. Is there any worse punishment???Beautiful, awesome, fresh, exhilarating, hopeful and a MUST WATCH.\u000a

V\u000aHave you ever thought analytically, why this movie is called the best\u000amovie ever made? I don't know but i want to watch it infinite times\u000abecause it has the power which will eloquently argue with you.The story tells you about Andy, a wrongfully accused person sentenced\u000ato life imprisonment for the murder of his wife and her lover. How can he find redemption from the Shawshank Prison? How will he\u000asurvive the cruelty and extreme heartlessness in the prison? Will he be\u000aable to see the world of outside the prison? It is all about the hope: Intend with some possibility of fulfillment.\u000aThis movie has both aspect of life i.e. agony and ecstasy. It will give\u000ayou an impression that nothing is impossible if you have hope and\u000awillpower.Very well acted by Tim Robbins as a silent and soft spoken person, who\u000ahas a lot to say from his eyes. Morgan Freeman as Red narrated the\u000astory brilliantly and given the best performance of his life. I loved the character of James Whitmore as "Brook" which defines the\u000aeffect of an automatic pattern of behavior in reaction to a specific\u000asituation; may be inherited or acquired through frequent repetition. It\u000ais heart-wrenching and overwhelming.Bob Gunton is ruthless and his immoderately desirous of acquiring\u000awealth is fantastic as warden Norton.Rita Hayworth's poster says a lot of things which is ineffable.A great movie with great cast because you will never forget a character\u000aof this movie.A movie for every movie watcher in the world. 10/10\u000a

V\u000atruly, the most inspiring a wonderful movie of all time. i first\u000awatched this film about four weeks ago, and that was when i realized i\u000awas missing out. in the past four weeks, i have watched this film 9\u000atimes: more than i've watched most other films over many years.to use an old cliché, the whole is greater than the sum of it's parts,\u000ais very apt. no single part of this film is stellar. but for some\u000areason, it all pulls together to provide an emotionally packed, awe\u000ainspiring film.***SPOILER*** the feel good film of all time, it keeps you amazed all\u000athe way through, culminating in an ending which could break even the\u000astrongest of souls.this is one film where it will never grow old, and the ending will\u000anever, ever fail to move me.\u000a

V\u000aOne of the few movies that really succeed into telling a story as much\u000aas grabbing you with it, few other movies do that. As a powerful\u000amessage that you can relate to and be inspired by. Genius if you're\u000aable to buy it don't think :"Should I?" well here's my answer of course\u000ayou caca-dudy... You know if you can't there's always the TV not like\u000athat's gonna get away from you. And yes there are other movies you may\u000alike MORE than this one but it's undeniably one of the bes at every\u000acategory (except comedy but that's why Johnny's there) and if you watch\u000athis movie and hate on it or EVEN think that it is overrated then you\u000acan go to hell and i don't certainly don't wanna know you. Why is (as\u000afar as i know) the best movie ever? Because of the effect it lives you\u000awith such a powerful message of freedom friendship and glory (just like\u000aStand by me) can not get overstated, buy it if you can't or see it on\u000aTV i don't know as long as you see this masterpiece, that's all it\u000acoounts, damn it!\u000a

V\u000aThis is a great movie with a great storyline and tremendous\u000aperformances. The movie is best viewed in the television edited version\u000abecause it is a story for the whole family if the language and\u000aunnecessary sexual scenes are omitted. I have spent many Sunday\u000amornings watching this movie on TNT. I was totally shocked when we\u000arented the movie for a trip and watched the unedited version. Morgan Freeman is wonderful as usual. Tim Robbins plays his part\u000aperfectly although he does not appear to possess the physical\u000aattributes necessary in some parts of the film. The plot develops with\u000aperfect timing and the music works well with the time, location and\u000astory. It is a movie that can be seen over and over again due to its\u000atimeless plot.\u000a

V\u000aI can honestly say I don't know why I have waited so long to see\u000aShawshank Redemption. When it initially was released I thought to\u000amyself another boring prison movie. I can say know how wrong I was the\u000afriendships that grow within this moves was so touching. It didn't seem\u000ato match friendships of everyday free people.The movie is about a banker Andy Dufresne (Tim Robbins) being sentenced\u000afor 2 murders, but stands by his innocence. The first few years while\u000aAndy is at Shawshank he chooses to stay to him and stay out others way,\u000ahe feels this would be the best way to stay out of trouble. Andy then\u000abefriends Ellis Boyd 'Red' Redding (Morgan Freeman), and the bond that\u000athey create with each other last through so many trials and\u000atribulations such as Red going up against the parole board several\u000atimes, friends being released and losing some of those friends. In\u000aaddition they deal with a corrupt warden (Bob Gunton) and a just as\u000acorrupt prison guard Captain Hadley (Clancy Brown). This movie reminds\u000ame of Beaches in the way that no matter how close you hold your friends\u000athere are some secrets you just can't reveal right away and possibly\u000aAndy and Red trust each other so much because they are there for the\u000asame reason and they know no matter what Red will always steer Andy in\u000athe right direction even if he doesn't choose to listen.Andy is not always like by others in the prison because he is refusing\u000ato give up some of his "rights". However, by initially assisting\u000aCaptain Hadley with a financial situation, some of those prisoners now\u000ago another way when Andy around. When Warden Norton finds out about\u000athese banking skills Andy has, Warden Norton finds a way to prosper and\u000astay below the radar.Andy takes all of this in and seeks help to rehabilitate the prisoners\u000ain the system. Eventually Andy comes to find out there may be some news\u000athat can prove his innocence, however this will disrupt the system that\u000aWarden Norton has created and that is eventually ended. Andy still\u000apreservers with what he is trying to accomplish in prison. This movie is a powerful message of friendship and will power. It\u000ashowed that no matter what your situation, you find the means to make\u000athe best or worst of it. Andy and Red took life in prison and made it\u000awhat it was. They looked out for each other and made sure their bond\u000acould never be broken.\u000a

V\u000aThis is I would have to say is my favorite movie. It is the only movie\u000aI would deem absolutely perfect.This movie is about a man who goes to jail (robbins) that meets a man\u000anamed red (freeman. Through hard times these two manage to bond. This\u000ais a story of hope and redemtion that no one should miss.I personally wonder why they have not came out with a movie of this\u000acaliber in soo long. The 21 centuary is the pits for movies. Everybody\u000acould see they made the best movies in the 90s, this one of course,\u000agoodfellas, forrest gump, casino,American history x, the list goes on\u000aand on.I very much insist that everybody watch this movie. If there is one\u000amovie you should see in your life its this one. It will captivate you\u000awith every sentence, every scene. Now don't have the wrong idea this is\u000ano action packed prison gangbang, This is a drama about two men and\u000atheir friendship. Though it is very very entertaining.If you haven't seen this movie run to your nearest video store and pick\u000aup a copy you could probably buy it on DVD for 10 bucks and it will be\u000athe best movie in your collection. My only 10 out of 10 so far\u000aShawshank Redemtion , watch it friends\u000a

V\u000aWow!!! And just in case I haven't made my self clear enough, WOW!!!!\u000aThere are movies you kinda enjoy, good ones and even the occasional\u000awelcome surprise. And then, seldom, you come across a movie like this\u000aone. The kind where the end titles have already gotten to the\u000asoundtrack part, but you still haven't budged not believing what just\u000ahit you. This is a story which will take you on a truly beautiful\u000ajourney, through all possible emotions, always under the steady\u000aguidance of Morgan Freeman's unequaled narrative. Tim Robbins is simply\u000abrilliant, making the evolution from docile, even fragile, inmate to\u000ajailbreak mastermind a riveting experience. All in all, I have always\u000afound it surprising, given the bleak prison life dominating the film's\u000astory, how this movie is foremost a tale of perseverance, true\u000afriendship and hope.\u000a

V\u000athis movie is now ranked 1/250 of the movies that has been made ever ,\u000amaybe this will change , but the quality of the movie will never change\u000a. it's a movie that satisfies every taste in someways.. when you see a\u000amovie with this limited cast and limited locations as well to shoot\u000a...actually u can count the location a single hand including the\u000ashawshank prison. the director had the potential to make u feel\u000ainterested in the movie in a way that u forget about the exciting sets\u000aand wonderful pictures available in other movies ... he was sticked to\u000athe point of the prison with its cells and people in those cells with\u000atheir categories as the (sisters) and the hero friends , and he never\u000aforgot to highlight the rulers and the bosses of this place , u can\u000afeel bored when u see the likeness of the scenes in the same locations\u000aover and over ..but it didn't happen in this movie in a way ..Tim\u000aRobbins and Morgan freeman had their own bond in performance using this\u000ato make the screenplay even brighter and stronger. you can never blame\u000athe filmmaker on making a part of the movie for freeman to be the\u000anarrator , it was certainly a plus to the movie. the drift in the last\u000a15 minutes ..make u change the path of your thinking to get it right\u000aand that's always great to add some suspense in such a dramatic movie\u000awhere the viewer is living the story and imaging the end in another way\u000a. this movie is top because every aspect of it was done by people on\u000athe top of their game. it doesn't matter if it didn't collect a pack of\u000aOscars , nomination is not s awful..but this is a classic long living\u000amovie.\u000a

V\u000aUnfortunately, there isn't an option available to give this film a\u000aRating of higher than 10. I remember as a child watching with awe\u000aDisney movies like the lion king and Aladdin and used to think it wont\u000aGet any better than this. Then as i matured i watched many more movies\u000aThat again gave me that sense of happiness that i was fortunate enough\u000aTo be able to experience such great movies in my life time. But quite\u000asoon, all these Hollywood movies started to seem quite stereotypical\u000aand quite run of the mill stuff. I used to think that Hollywood had\u000alost its magic for me. Then came along this movie which I Watched 15\u000ayears after its release. I must admit that i watched it out Of\u000acuriosity for its being on the top of the IMDb list. And i was\u000aSkeptical of its quality, given the name was not too much of an eye\u000aCatcher plus the fact that it did not win any Oscars. How wrong i was!\u000aHollywood has outdone itself once again. I could write a whole book on\u000aThe greatness of this film, the acting, the direction, the soundtrack\u000a.. I mean it doesn't have any action sequences or any romance or\u000aAnything of the sort. But it is one of those films that makes you feel\u000aHappy inside and yet sad that you may live many more years and watch\u000aTons of movies but never feel the same climax or emotion that you get\u000aOut of this movie. I have seen both Forrest gimp and Pulp fiction which\u000aTruly are masterpieces on their own, i truly love those movies. But\u000aReally, its nothing short of a crime to not award the Shaw-shank\u000aRedemption the best movie of the millennium, let alone the best movie\u000aof The year. I guess the box office reception of this movie had\u000asomething To do with it not winning the award. A must watch for anyone\u000ahaving an Iota of emotion and love for artistic work.\u000a

V\u000aThis movie deserves all the accolades it has received over the years.\u000aThe character development was excellent. The acting was excellent...\u000aand the storyline itself was very good, and developed beautifully\u000athroughout the film. I have watched this movie several times (as it is\u000aone of those films you can watch again and again), and each time it\u000astill captures my attention through to the end. I wont dive too much\u000ainto details on the plot of the film (as it is a very well known\u000amovie); but will note that it is a definite 'must see' for all those\u000awho consider themselves "movie connoisseurs". There are not too many\u000anegatives (if any) that can be said on the film. I will state, however,\u000ait's current #1 ranking on the IMDb Top 250 is a little bit high\u000athough. Morgan Freeman(Red) was extraordinary in this film. Tim Robbins\u000a(Andy Dufresne)has nothing on his resume close to his performance here\u000a(maybe his performance in Arlington Road). As for resumes, if this is\u000anot on your 'movies seen' resume, you need to improve yourself!\u000a

V\u000aThis wasn't the first prison movie I've seen. The ones I had seen\u000abefore this consisted of gangs of criminals brutally murdering each\u000aother. Or it involved drug dealers who ran the prison, without the\u000aslightest sign of any law force slowing them down.This movie has those elements, but doesn't exploit them as many prison\u000amovies often do. There is no epic fight or riot scene in the end.\u000aThat's what I enjoy about this movie. It's not about deranged dealers,\u000apsychotic killers, or blood thirsty rapist. There normal people (more\u000aor less) living in this world that many will never have to witness. (Be\u000athankful for that.) I'm not really sure if this is a spoiler or not\u000abecause it doesn't change much in the story, but Tim Robbins plays a\u000aman falsely accused of killing his wife and her lover. It was a misstep\u000ato make him innocent, as it would of made his character more 'real' to\u000ahave made a mistake in his life that he deeply regrets, as Red has.\u000aRed, played by Morgan Freeman, is the actors best role to date, and\u000ahe's had many great roles in his career. You sympathize with this\u000acharacter greatly and you actually come to care for his fate much more\u000athan you do Andy's (Robbins).Overall, I think this a wonderful film that is very well written (based\u000aoff a great short story by the master of horror, Stephen King), well\u000adirected, perfectly acted, with a satisfying ending (though I can see\u000ahow some can call it a typical 'Hollywood'ending).That being said, is classifying it number one on IMDb justice? No. I'd\u000abe more than happy with it in the top 100, but the fact is there are\u000abetter films out there, some which aren't even in the top 250. So I\u000agive it a final score 8/10, I think I'm being fair when I say that.\u000a

V\u000aMorgan Freeman and Tim Robbins are absolutely fantastic in this movie.\u000aIts a movie you can watch over and over again without getting bored. It\u000akeeps us on the edge of our seat. Fantastic directing, and to learn it\u000awas originally wrote by Stephen King (the best writer of all time in my\u000aopinion) just makes it even more brilliant. If you haven't seen this before you need to, its a movie for life. The\u000aending is phenomenal. But be warned there is violence in this movie and\u000asome disturbing scenes, but to be honest without them it wouldn't be\u000athat good. I love this movie and i wouldn't be able to understand\u000aanybody who would dislike it. Watch It ! You will love it..

V\u000aBefore watching this movie i knew that it would be good,but frankly\u000aspeaking i had the prejudice of it being overrated.I was like "How the\u000ahell can this movie be praised that much?It has to be good but for\u000aChrist's sake it can't be that good as people say!".Now,after having watched The Shawshank Redemprion i can say only one\u000athing: Never,and i mean never,be prejudiced before watching a\u000amovie.Even if you have been disappointed by movies that the hype had\u000amade think they would be great.Shawshank Redemption is perfect in every way.The acting,the\u000adirection,the soundtrack but most importantly this movie has the most\u000abeautiful and incredible story of them all.People say that movies' significance for the viewer is not just one but\u000amany.I agree,they are made in order to amuse you,to relax you and take\u000ayour mind away of the deadly everyday routine,at least for an hour or\u000atwo.They are made also to take you in different "worlds" and make you\u000asee things from another perspectives.But in my book the major\u000asignificance of movies to mankind is to pass him and remind life's most\u000avaluable things.In this very film the value that is being radiated so to speak is\u000ahope.In fact the whole movie is about the thing that many people lose\u000awhen they are in difficult situations,it is spelled h-o-p-e.And the way\u000athe movie promotes hope is so powerful that it changes you in a\u000away,especially if you need it.The bottom line is that The Shawshank Redemption is the most beautiful\u000amovie of all time and it fulfills the major significance a film can\u000ahave in a human being's life.For the end i leave Andy Dufresne's quote\u000a"Hope is a good thing, maybe the best of things, and no good thing ever\u000adies"...\u000a

V\u000aMy gosh, where to begin with this movie.....practically everything was\u000anailed, spot-on. The story is as compelling and ultimately uplifting as\u000aone will ever find in cinema -- from the very get-go we see Andy\u000aDufresne in a courtroom, being sentenced to life in prison for the\u000amurder of two people. So instinctively, we believe this must be true --\u000aafter all the judge did rule him guilty, right? But over time Andy\u000agrows on us, until we learn of his actual innocence, and by the end of\u000athe movie one can't help but root him on in his pursuit of freedom. Tim\u000aRobbins is the perfect assignment to play Andy, as Robbins'\u000alesser-known status as an actor (as opposed to Tom Hanks, who was\u000aconsidered for this role) eases his task of being the quiet, tranquil\u000aAndy who prefers to keep to his own business. Andy's easygoing yet\u000apensive nature makes him the ideal protagonist, as he is an independent\u000athinker yet he can peacefully interact with all others.His friendship with Red (Morgan Freeman) is the backbone of The\u000aShawshank Redemption. Red, a contraband smuggler, may be different from\u000aAndy in almost all respects, but over the years Andy earns Red's\u000arespect through his acts of courage and selflessness. This movie\u000ateaches that title does not have to dictate behavior -- a man who is in\u000aprison can be as kind and generous as anyone outside of prison walls --\u000ait all depends on how far you're willing to look into that man's heart.\u000aI also love the fact that the friendship of the two men heightens very\u000agradually -- that seems far more realistic than the instant-friends\u000athat one often sees in all mediums of story telling. This one takes\u000atime to develop, creating a profundity in the relationship and\u000acontributing to one of the movie's themes (time). This theme teaches us\u000ahow much things can change over time, and also lends to the purported\u000anotion that Andy and Red have been in prison for a very long time.Red's narration is one of the standout features of The Shawshank\u000aRedemption. It is both poignant and insightful, allowing us unlimited\u000aaccess to his mind, which makes our empathy for him so real. While in\u000amost other films we learn about characters only through dialogue, in\u000athis one Red divulges practically everything to us. His abandonment of\u000ahope and eventual love for Andy makes him a tragic figure that should\u000apull at the heartstrings of all viewers. When we first see him attempt\u000ato receive parole in 1947, he seems to be no more than an unfeeling\u000acriminal. But by 1967 when he's trying to leave Shawshank Prison after\u000a40 years of incarceration, we hang on every word of his memorable\u000a"rehabilitated" speech. And when he meets Andy on the beach in the\u000afinal scene, and the two peacefully embrace with a hug as the camera\u000afades away, it is hard to hold back tears of joy.A significant aspect of this film is its theme of institutionalization.\u000aWe are made to scrutinize exactly what prison does to people. How does\u000aa man adapt to freedom again, once he has been released? All Brooks\u000aHatlen could land was a job as a grocery bagger and a room in a halfway\u000ahouse. This inauspicious lifestyle, plus the insecurities of being away\u000afrom familiar faces while among all the technological/social changes\u000asince the start of his 50-year sentence, overwhelmed Brooks, as we all\u000asaw in a speechlessly dramatic suicide scene. Red lived in much the\u000asame fear before he decided to take off and cross the border to visit\u000aAndy. So we're forced to ask ourselves: does even a finite prison\u000asentence essentially end the free will of its recipient? Is it better\u000ato leave the inmate in prison in certain cases? This cuts deeply into\u000athe philosophy of society's legal system.But the overarching theme of The Shawshank Redemption is hope. Hope is\u000aa wonderful, vital virtue that should never be absent in any human\u000aheart. Andy echoes this through his audacious acts (be it offering\u000afinancial advice to Hadley or playing classical music over the prison\u000aintercom (which is one of the finest scenes you will ever see in\u000acinema)). He vocalizes his faith in hope to his inmates when he claims\u000athat his two weeks in solitary confinement were the "easiest" he'd ever\u000adone, all thanks to the music he kept in his head. He tells Red "get\u000abusy living, or get busy dying" and uses the death of Brooks as his\u000aevidence, much to Red's initial chagrin. Yes, Andy is built into an\u000aicon for hope in this movie, and that is what makes it so universally\u000asuccessful in its appeal. Hope can and should be adopted by every human\u000abeing who graces the earth. This notion is expressed through Andy's\u000aentire struggle, as well as in Thomas Newman's incredible musical score\u000afor the film (which is so good it has been used in multiple movie\u000atrailers before to evoke emotional response). This precious lesson,\u000atold through a film in which literally everything is perfectly\u000amastered, is what makes The Shawshank Redemption one of the greatest\u000afilms ever made.\u000a

V\u000aI think that this movie was extremely well made, and it accurately\u000aportrayed life on the inside. This film's many great dialogues and\u000abeautiful cinematography make it one of the best movies ever made. The cinematography in The Shawshank Redemption is excellent. Beautiful\u000ashots of the iconic prison are shown from all angles. These shots make\u000ayou realize how tough it would be to live your life in a place that you\u000ahave no chance of escaping, a place that you are seemingly bound\u000aforever in. The shots of the prison make you feel the power and\u000ainfluence of the workers of the prison, and how little hope is left for\u000athe people. Inside. Shots like this make all the difference in the\u000aemotional deposit of hope that this movie instills towards the end of\u000athe story. Dark gloomy shots of the inside an outside of the prison set\u000athe mood for the entire film, and perfectly depict the harsh, dark life\u000aof the prison world. The editing in The Shawshank Redemption is great.\u000aEvery scene in this movie serves a specific purpose, and all of these\u000ascenes in coherence with each other make this movie as great as it is.\u000aAlmost every scene in the movie serves the purpose of making the\u000aaudience experience the dark dungeon that is the Shawshank prison, and\u000amakes them realize how very fragile life is. The acting in this movie is some of the best you will find in any movie\u000aanywhere. Actors such as Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman help shape this\u000amovie into the dark masterpiece that it is. Almost every actor in this\u000amovie helps give the audience the overall vibe of prison life, and\u000ahelps the people of the outside world see the beautiful injustices of\u000athe movie's legal system. Tim Robbins, who plays the main character\u000aAndy Dufrense, does a beautiful job of depicting life in a federal\u000aprison, and all of the high risks situations an inmate faces every day.\u000aRobbins goes from being a young, callow inmate to being an experienced\u000ahardened inmate that pretty much runs the prisons. Robbins expressions\u000aafter coming out of solitary and finding out that one of his friends\u000ahave died make this movie what it is, and his performance acts as a\u000afoundation upon which the movie is laid. Morgan Freeman, playing inmate\u000a"Red" Redding also greatly helps guide this movie into the blockbuster\u000aextravaganza that it has become. Freeman accurately depicts a hardened\u000aman on the inside that is touching by the quite and caring personality\u000aof a man not yet affected by the scourges of the outside world. Freeman\u000adepicts his character with aplomb and poise, and he helps to make\u000aShawshank a movie that over 100 million people will see.The Music and sound effects in this movie are very good. Period piece\u000amovies always require a solid soundtrack that also comes from the\u000asetting. The music department for Shawshank has a perfect balance\u000abetween music from the period and eerie sound effects that help turn\u000aShawshank into a dark, secluded movie. A soft, quite violin when the\u000aprisoners walk through the doors of Shawshank set the mood for the\u000aoutline of the movie, and the creators of Shawshank use Mozart (played\u000aby Andy) to calm the prisoners and distract them from the hopeless\u000alives which they lead. Overall, the music and sound effects greatly\u000acontribute to the plot of this movie. The direction of the film The Shawshank Redemption is wonderful. One of\u000athe greatest directors of all time, Frank Darabont, use this movie to\u000adisplay his brilliance of directing. Darabont also wrote the screenplay\u000afor this movie, (adapted from the novel by Stephen King) and\u000amanipulates the characters to do his will throughout the movie. Every\u000apiece of the movie is synchronized to perfection, and Darabont displays\u000athe common criminal in a way never seen before y the human eye.\u000aDarabont explores the dark, gloomy side to life on the inside, but\u000astill leaves the audience feeling happy and enlightened in the end.\u000aJust when it seems that Darabont has mitigated hope into absolute\u000auncertainty, he surprises the audience with the strong influence the\u000aidea of hope has over all people. Overall, the directing in this movie\u000agives it its fire, and it puts the cinematography and the acting in\u000atheir place to do justice to the movie world.\u000a

V\u000aHey! This is my review of The Shawshank Redemtion. (Obviously) There\u000aisn't anything to say about this movie that hasn't already been said a\u000ahundred fifty five thousand times on this site so there is well, no\u000areal point in reviewing it but I just want to give you my opinion, I\u000ahave checked some reviews and the people who hate this really have\u000anothing to back up their opinion on why they hate the movie, some\u000alovers don't either even though it is much more common. I am going to\u000aback up every single opinion so that you who actually haven't watched\u000athe movie will know whether to.Story: The story in this movie is about Andy Dufrense (Tim Robbins) God\u000a(Morgan Freeman) naah, just joking it's 'Red' and a few other inmates.\u000aThe movie also revolves around the almost insane Warden Norton (Bob\u000aGunton) and a very small amount of the guards which as implied earlier\u000ain the sentence don't really have a huge role, it is mostly about God\u000aand Andy. Andy is sent to prison for a crime that he may or may not\u000ahave committed, although reading two sentences of many reviews you will\u000aknow that he probably is innocent and in jail he meets God (Red) who is\u000athe guy who can get things for you, weed, cigarettes, pornographic\u000aplaying cards. If I go into too much detail on what happens inside of\u000athe prison I will probably give away huge spoilers so I can just say\u000athat Andy has his problems with the homosexual group of people who have\u000ataken a liking to him, the guards are not the most friendly men you'll\u000asee in a movie. Andy has at first a hard time fitting in amongst the\u000acriminals who are so different from him. The story is very gripping, at\u000atimes sad and the excellent conclusion will make you leave your chair\u000awith a sense of unexplainable awesomeness.Story: 10/10Acting: Oh, the acting in this movie...! I have never in my life seen\u000asuch passioned and realistically, well, acting actors. Tim Robbins\u000abrings his already engaging role to life and how can you go wrong with\u000aGod in a drama film? Morgan Freeman is the king of drama and has in\u000athis movie very pleasantly surprised me with a different role, I have\u000anot seen many of his drama films but he is always the friendly,\u000ainnocent guy but here he does not seem very innocent, sure he is very\u000anice and friendly especially to Andy Dufrense but he is the smuggler? I\u000ahad expected them to have switched roles, when I heard it was this way\u000aaround I started to have my doubts about the film but it was a nice\u000achange. The warden also delivers a very solid performance but I cannot\u000acompare it to any other movie since I have never ever seen him before.\u000a(I believe) This is the best acting I have ever seen and just add to\u000athe feelings I described at the end of the story "review".Acting: 10/10Sound/Music: It was pretty silly of me to call this SOUND/music since I\u000aam not going to share my opinion on the sound, there just isn't\u000aanything to say about it, but the music is spectacular, it hit spot on\u000aand while not the best I have heard, very good and perfectly fitting\u000athe movie.MUSIC: 10/10Conclusion: I would have written about the special effects but there is\u000areally nothing to write about since this is not a sci-fi, war movie or\u000aaction movie, there is nothing to actually mention. For EIGTH years I\u000ahave been under the impression that LOTR was the best movie ever made\u000aand that this changed my mind is pretty amazing. There is probably some\u000aaspect of the movie that I have not yet reviewed but everything was\u000abasically perfect. The movie is gripping and story, acting and music\u000aweave together in a web of awesomeness. This is undoubtedly the best\u000amovie ever made and anyone who hasn't seen it, WHAT ARE YOU WAITING\u000aFOR?10/10Now remember to vote that this review was helpful if you think it was\u000aand that it wasn't if it wasn't! HOPE I HELPED YOU! <3\u000a

V\u000aCall me a wet blanket, by I won't join the chorus calling SR the\u000agreatest movie ever. Entertaining, yes. Thrilling at times, also. But\u000ain both regards I actually had more fun watching The Sting, or\u000aCapricorn One for that matter. Great cinematography though, specially\u000aduring some incredible shots, that of the whole jail population\u000astanding still, frozen in their places, hearing the two sopranos sing\u000aMozart and the one of Andy standing in the rain, raising both arms to\u000athe skies, expressing the joy of being a free man again.The acting is excellent across the board, except for the kid, who\u000alabors too much to be likable. The atmosphere of the prison is suitably\u000aconveyed in the claustrophobic settings, from the hopelessly enclosed,\u000abarren, courtyard inside the high walls to the always menacing presence\u000aof the uniformed guards. Here those hovering presences are not mere\u000adecorations, part of the landscape, as in many prison movies, but true\u000acomponents of the brutal reality of the world behind bars. The mortal\u000abeating received by one of the newcomers, the first night, warns us\u000athat these guards are an active part of the plot, so we have to take\u000athem seriously, get used to see them as such.This is a superbly done production from any point of view. The pace is\u000athoroughly sustained, its overall forward flow allowing for scenes of\u000aunmitigated violence fit the unfolding story as effortlessly as others\u000amore settled ones, without modifying the momentum, because there's\u000aalways something, someone, anchoring them all to the essential thrust\u000aof the film; the best ex.: the contemplative faces of the convicts,\u000aseen in semi darkness, while Hadley beats the newcomer to death, which\u000atells us this kind of incident is just part of their everyday lives,\u000aalmost a routine occurrence.What makes SR lose points in my book is the unlikely in some crucial\u000aplot elements as the unrealistic in some scenes, developments,\u000aespecially after Andy has escaped. The biggest plot hole of all, IMHO,\u000ais the fact that warden Norton should have ever trusted the management\u000aof his scam to a convicted criminal under his careand a double\u000amurderer at that, as Andy was for him anyway. Call me naive, but I\u000adon't think there's one single warden in the world dumb enough to do\u000asuch a thing when he may have easy access to many experts in the\u000aoutside--financial consultants, bankerswho would give him help,\u000aadvice, as useful, or even better, as the one provided by a convict who\u000acould easily turn into a blackmailer. And what best proves this point\u000ais precisely what Andy says to Red when explaining how he organized the\u000afraud--the false identity of Randall Stevens, the multiple bank\u000aaccounts--when he gloats that "It's amazing what you can accomplish by\u000amail". As Norton had to know at least as much about these matters, how\u000acould he have trusted in a man who not only had the ability to take the\u000awhole thing away from him, as the experienced banker he was, but who\u000acould also send someone by mail the story of the scam, as an insurance\u000apolicy, in case things would get dangerous for him in the can? Norton\u000ahad to know from the beginning he was engaging in a loser's game. If he\u000aeliminated Andy he risked losing forever contact with his hidden funds;\u000aand if he didn't, he'd be forever vulnerable to his blackmail. So it\u000aisn't surprising why Andy's so happy about the whole thing. The\u000aquestion is, how could have Norton been so stupid to think he had any\u000acontrol on the situation? Other plot holes concern Andy's escape. See,\u000ahe crawls hundreds of yards inside a 2--feet sewage pipe and then\u000aeverything--the stink of human waste above all--goes away as by charm,\u000awith a simple rainfall. He smells like roses again. And just hours\u000alater he's perfectly groomed, dressed, ready to visit every bank\u000amanager in surrounding towns to make the necessary withdraws. He\u000adoesn't even look tired, when he surely must haven't taken a wink in\u000athe last 24 hours, busy as he was trying to get away from the jail\u000ahouse. And how did he manage to reach the Mexican frontier safe and\u000aunmolested? didn't the authorities publish his mug shot in every\u000anewspaper, tacked it to the wall on every police station, bus stop,\u000awithin a few hours of his evasion? That part of his odyssey seems to\u000ahave occurred as by miracle or divine protection. Now, if I'm nagging\u000aabout all these things is simply because this is drama--so I'm led to\u000athink from the beginningand drama is the genre towards which we are\u000athe least forgiving concerning the unrealistic or the unlikely. (In\u000athrillers like Capricorn One or The Sting we close our eyes to the same\u000athings, as we understand the main purpose there is to thrill us).Other of the weakest elements in SR lies in some of its characters. I\u000ahave nothing to say about Andy or Red--as Freeman plays here again his\u000aTed to Eastwood's Munny anyway. Neither about Hadley which if he seems\u000aa bit exaggerated in his wickedness doesn't seem unrealistic for\u000asomeone who has read Abbott's In the Belly of the Beast. But minor\u000acharacters are obviously used for emotional manipulation, specially the\u000arocker kid. About him, after Red's voice over says that "everyone liked\u000ahim"--what else we could do? (Anyway this character was put there just\u000ato show us viewers that Andy was innocent after all, so he was safely\u000adisposed of after that. Curious thing, I was comfortable with the idea\u000aof leaving that kind of foggy. Uhh, you can take people out of the Code\u000abut...). And the same for the situation with the Sisters, which is left\u000ato degenerate, when all what Hadley had to do was to tell them to leave\u000aAndy alone.But above all, great narrative, great plot development. 9/10.\u000a

V\u000aProbably one of the best movies I have ever seen. Its one of those\u000amovies where you just sit and reflect for a while after the final\u000acredits roll. Great plot, script, and acting. One of the best ever\u000amade. When Andy escaped at the end and screwed the warden over, my\u000agosh, it does not get any better than that. It also has one of those\u000atwists in it where you think that one thing is going to happen and the\u000acompletely opposite does. Near the end, when everyone thought that Andy\u000awas going to commit suicide and we all thought that he was going to be\u000ain the cell dead, he was gone, vanished. When the warden revealed the\u000awhole in the wall hidden by the poster I don't remember felling better\u000afor the outcome of a movie than I did at the end of this film.\u000a

V\u000aShawshank Redemtion is the best film I've ever seen, I personally think\u000athat they should make so many more unforgettable films like this\u000aelsewhere in the world. Overall this inspirational motion picture is\u000adefinitely out of this world. In my opinion this Movie is\u000athought-provoking and it touches your sole in many ways.Andy Dufresne who was unlawfully sentenced to life in prison for the\u000amurder of his wife and her lover, became great friends with 'Red' a\u000aconvict who was an influential inmate inside the Shawshank prison, they\u000abecame a surprising partnership inside Shawshank prison Night after\u000anight, day after day, Andy tried to adapt to prison life, however he\u000arealised he shouldn't be in this indescribable road to hell so thats\u000awhere his plans begin....\u000a

V\u000aEvery time I watch The Shawshank Redemption it reinforces the fact that\u000ait is my favorite movie of all time. But certainly as entertaining a\u000afilm that it is, being a personal favorite does not necessarily make it\u000aa great film or dare I saythe greatest film ever made. But what then\u000amakes a film great? First and foremost, if it sets out to entertain the\u000ageneral public, it must do that (and Shawshank certainly does that).\u000aIts pure entertainment value is essentially a stipulation in its\u000ainclusion in the great "greatest movie" debate. The serious nature of\u000aits central plot pointsa wrongly convicted murderer who assists the\u000acorrupt warden as means to affect his own escapeis contrasted by some\u000atruly funny scenes. Although by no means a comedy, the splendid\u000ascreenplay is wrought with witty dialog. There's nothing fancy about\u000athis filmno special effects, spectacular scenery or even a bunch of\u000apretty women. No, its just the telling of a story, mostly through the\u000anarration of Morgan Freeman's character, Red, that almost lulls viewers\u000ainto believing that nothing really interesting or important is going to\u000ahappen here. But after all of the subtle plot twists I think what makes\u000athis film great for me is I feel like I'm actually sharing in Andy's\u000aredemption. Now if that isn't what they teach in Film-making 101 then\u000athey should just close up the classroom. Ultimately, there cannot be a\u000asingle motion picture that is the "greatest film of all time" because\u000aas art, and in an art form as varied as cinema, greatness must be\u000ameasured by each individual. Greatness, as beauty, truly is in the eye\u000aof the beholder. But in this beholder's eyes I think The Shawshank\u000aRedemption is truly the greatest film I have ever seen.\u000a

V\u000aThis movie, in spite of several violent scenes, is well acted and has a\u000agreat plot line. The casting is excellent and the movie has moments of\u000abrilliance and is overall an excellent movie. The ending is satisfying\u000aand even though the characters are prisoners they have an air of\u000ahonesty and a desire to simply (a) accept responsibility for their\u000acrime and (b) to be able to live a life of peace and pursue happiness.\u000aFar too many times, in movies and on TV, men in prison are shown to be\u000asoulless/corrupt/violent/without redeeming qualities and yet our\u000aprisons are FULL of people who are INNOCENT of the crimes they are in\u000aprison for and the cops/prosecutors are NOT always right and they are,\u000ain many cases, as corrupt as the worst offenders. This movie is a\u000aclassic and has withstood the test of time. Take care and may God bless\u000ayou.\u000a

V\u000aThe Shawshank Redemption, is without a doubt the greatest film the\u000aworld has ever come across. From the moment i sat down to watch this,\u000athe mutual hype made me sceptical whether it will live up to my\u000aexpectations, but it could not have blown me away any more than it did.\u000aTim Robbins takes the leading role and in my opinion couldn't have done\u000aa better job, along with Morgan Freeman who delivered a fine supporting\u000arole. The compelling storyline, directing, casting and more\u000aimportantly, acting throughout the cast made this my favourite film\u000aever. I gave it 10 out of 10 because of this and out of the hundreds of\u000afilms i have rated, it was the only one with a perfect score. This film\u000ais about as 'must watch' as it gets, and anyone who hasn't must do so\u000aright away otherwise they are severely missing out.\u000a

V\u000ahi i'm 14 years old and this movie is my favourite film of all time.\u000aeverything about it is stunning, the set, the characters, the acting,\u000athe story, the directing, the writing, the music - everything was\u000afantastic and complemented the point of the film.everyttime i watch it, i seem to feel cleansed and happy. a whole lot\u000aof people would just say that it is a depressing and boring movie, but\u000awhen you watch it and understand the plot and watch it through to the\u000aend the "redemption" makes you feel "redeemed".while i probably enjoy a casual simple movie (whether comedy or action\u000aetc...) on a rainy day this movie is definitely my favourite. i\u000astrongly recommend this to anyone looking for an inspirational\u000a(although i'll admit it is a bit weird to be inspired by convicted\u000afelons) movie with clever twists and ingenuity. a 10/10 for me\u000a

V\u000aThis is now the 2,340th Review of this Title. However, I'm still\u000awriting it because this movie deserves to be written about. It really\u000aexceeds the 10/10 scale. An awe-inspiring story of hope, this is just\u000aone of those movies that you know you still want to watch in 20 years.\u000aThe movie premise itself at first sight doesn't seem like it will be\u000aall that interesting. However, from the first minutes, you realize the superior writing,\u000aacting and cinematography unrivaled I would say by any other film I've\u000aseen. Throughout the movie, I find myself constantly connected to the\u000acharacters, wishing that the warden would overcome his cold-hearted\u000anature and concede to let our antagonist, Andy free from the torment\u000athat was The Shawshank Prison. I almost let out an audible sob when\u000aTommy was shot. If you're looking for something to bring you up, to give you hope,\u000ayou've come to the right place. This movie is probably the most\u000asoul-touching piece of two and half hour film out there, encompassing\u000afriendship, suffering, hope, and freedom. This movie is really what I believe that this should serve as the model\u000afor Hollywood. It's about time that they learn that for a movie to be\u000agood, it doesn't need excessive gore, or explosions on screen, or\u000aspecial effects, or sex scenes or any of what comes with the modern-day\u000aHollywood production. This movie is pretty simple. Just men talking. If you haven't seen this movie yet, now the #1 movie on the IMDb leader\u000aboards, you don't know what you're missing. A must see for anybody and\u000aeverybody of age. (10/10)\u000a

V\u000aFrank Dabaront is not a name that is known to everybody...He certainly\u000aisn't the most popular director on the planet. Regardless, he has made\u000aa film that has touched people all over the world. The film that is\u000abrutal, yet astonishing: Shawshank Redemption.I first of all, wasn't surprised at all that this was the highest-rated\u000afilm on IMDb. It has every ingredient a film needs...Universe,\u000acreation, acting, and a powerful storyline. The rare film that\u000aextraordinarily grabbed me and never let go...Also the rare film that\u000aexceeds in every aspect.The film is obviously believable too, Freeman and Robbins pull in extra\u000aperfection to it. Freeman is a brilliant narrator, and he tells us the\u000aplot like it was rehearsed a couple thousand times! Robbins is also\u000asurprisingly great, he plays the (main) character with adorable\u000agratitude and unstoppable force. His performance is worth watching over\u000aand over again...Overall, its not for everyone to see (like the impeccable Forrest\u000aGump), but it all shapes up with a powerful ending and a strong\u000amessage.\u000a

V\u000aCan a man find redemption if he truly repents for the crimes he'd\u000acommitted? Can the human spirit triumph even in the darkest of places,\u000alike a prison? Is hope a dangerous thing? These are the questions you\u000awill be asking yourself after watching this Fillet Mignon of a film\u000amasterpiece. Based on the incredible writer Stephen King and directed\u000aby the diamond in the rough film director Frank Darabont, the Shawshank\u000aRedemption is one of the greatest movies of all time, in my opinion.\u000aIt's one of those movies that whenever it is on TV, I can't help but\u000awatch it from start to finish.The story is narrated by the soothing voice of Morgan Freeman, named\u000aRed. And he tells us of the time a new prisoner, Andy a former bank\u000aexecutive convicted of murdering his wife and her lover, came to the\u000aShawshank Pennitentary. At first, Andy has a tough time adjusting to\u000aprison life, even getting beaten up a few times by the fellow thugs.\u000aBut soon he finds his place doing the taxes of all the guards and the\u000awarden.There are so many good things about this film, I can barely think of\u000aall of them. The story in which it was based was indeed an enthralling\u000aone, Frank Darabont directed it and did a great job, not to mention the\u000agrade-A casting.I'm not sure what the main theme of this movie is, but if I had to\u000aguess, it would be about hope. And that hope cannot escape anyone, even\u000athose in positions where they feel like there is none. And that\u000aredemption is available for any man.I rate this movie a 10. I never considered giving it anything less.\u000a

V\u000aLet me start with the basics...fantastic story...amazing\u000adirection...great dialogues...groundbreaking performances...heart\u000aaching soundtracks...and a priceless lesson in living...No movie probably can touch you more positively than Shawshank\u000aRedemption...Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman would be just as in trouble\u000afor this as Al Pacino had for Godfather. Just like Al is forever\u000aremembered for his depiction of Don Corleone in Godftaher, both these\u000aactors, who have had a long line of brilliant performances, would at\u000athe end of the day, be remembered for their roles as Andy and Red. For\u000aabout two hours or so, every viewer would be transformed into an inmate\u000aof the Shawshank Prison, share their lives, feel sorry for their\u000amiseries and glow in their joys. It is a movie which has the rare\u000acapability of making you smile and cry at the same time. It is probably the most underrated movie of all times. The reason i say\u000athis is because, notwithstanding the fact that it is the number 1 in\u000aIMDb's top 250, it is sad to see that its not one of the top grossing\u000amovies of all time. But then again some movies are too good to be\u000aenjoyed and favoured by everyone. It takes special kind of movie lovers\u000ato enjoy a movie of the calibre of SR. To borrow the words of Morgan Freeman, some things are better left\u000aunsaid. See the movie for yourself and if it doesn't make your heart\u000aweep and ache at its beauty, then well, you're not just one of those\u000aspecial kind I am afraid.\u000a

It's a picture about friendship , the value of life\u000aand the importance of education ..... the point its to be free wherever\u000ayou are....some people are not in prison but live in fear for everyday\u000adifficulties and lose all the courage they have about life but our\u000acharacters have the strength to feel free inside and catch their dream\u000aoutside the prison. This movie directed perfectly !!!! Tim Robbins and\u000aMorgan Freeman saw to us their tremendous talent !!! . A must see !!!\u000ap.s : is the best movie i have ever seen !!!\u000a

V\u000aThe Shawshank Redemption is a true classic film of the 90's imagined by\u000athe great mind of Stephen King and stars two amazing actors, Tim\u000aRobbins and Morgan Freeman.The story is one of hope and misfortune. The main character Andy\u000aDufresne (Tim Robbins) is accused of a murder for being in the wrong\u000aplace at the wrong time. After a very unfair trail he is sent to the\u000ainfamous Shawshank prison. During his stay at Shawshank he befriends\u000aEllis Redding (Morgan Freeman) who helps him on his journey of escaping\u000athe prison. The course of the movie shows the classic dark idea of life in a\u000acorrupt prison. Warden Norton is that Warden that you just can't trust\u000aand one that is on a power-trip crusade throughout the movie. The\u000ainmates of Shawshank all have a different story and Morgan's character\u000aEllis explains how over-time, the inmates become institutionalized and\u000ahave a hard time functioning outside of the prison as it's all they\u000ahave known.It doesn't take long for Andy Dufresne to come up with a escape plan.\u000aTowards the beginning of the film Ellis helps him to get carving tools\u000ato "carve chess pieces," but over time actually carves a tunnel through\u000ahis cell wall and keeps it hidden with posters of super models over the\u000ayears. Throughout Andy's stay in Shawshank he forms a close bond with Ellis\u000aand he tells him when he gets out to go to this place and look under a\u000astone. You won't find out why until the end of the film.Despite it being written by Stephen King the ending is actually a happy\u000aending. Not quite sappy but a good ending and a ending that seems well\u000adeserved. It's amazing how Shawshank Redemption took a relatively simple idea and\u000aturned it into a classic. The old cliché of digging your way out of\u000aprison by tunnel and being unjustly accused for a murder in a time\u000awhere there was no such thing as forensic science actually happen quite\u000aa bit in those days, but the way it was imagined and executed in this\u000amovie is just classic and one for the ages.\u000a

V\u000aI've watched a number of movies during the years. I'm not sure whether\u000athat number is north of 500 but it's definitely close. No other movie\u000ahas had the effect that Shawshank Redemption has on me every time I\u000awatch it.The movie describes the years in prison of Andy Dufresne(Tim Robbins),\u000aa banker who is convicted for the murder of his wife. There he meets\u000aRed(Morgan Freeman), another convicted felon, who -like most movies\u000afeaturing Morgan Freeman- is also the narrator of the movie.Throughout his years in prison, we watch Andy go from some prisoners'\u000aboxing bag, to prison's librarian, to prison guards' personal banker.\u000aWe experience with him the pain, the frustration, the sorrow. Tim\u000aRobbins gives a magnificent performance opposite Morgan Freeman's Red,\u000amaybe the only role outshining Mandela in Invictus. I won't bother you with technical details about direction,\u000acinematography and art direction. The All-Time Best Movie place here in\u000aIMDb is by it's own a testament of the excellence that is the Shawshank\u000aRedemption. Few (if any) movies will provide the viewer with such a\u000afeeling of catharsis by the end. I hope I haven't spoiled it. If you haven't already watched this masterpiece of a movie, rush to the\u000anearest DVD store. Every human being able of watching a movie should\u000awatch this movie at least once.Cheers\u000a

V\u000aFrom the intro setting up the mood for the 1940s with If I didn't Care\u000athat strangely feels like Bioshock or Fallout from the other era\u000adefining themes such as the relevance of Rita Haywood from the 50s to\u000aTommy Williams emulating the James Dean Rock' n Roll character to set\u000athe mood of the 60s. This is something that has not been addressed when\u000areviewing this movie, how it seamlessly transfer from era to era is\u000agenius in itself. The camaraderie between Andy and Red is flawless and\u000athe viewer truly believes that these two are the leaders of Shawshank\u000aand are the best of friends. By leaders, just look at the scene where\u000aHeywood is about to be slit by Brooks and Andy and Red are notified\u000aright away to solve the problem; great scene symbolizing their\u000aimportance to the group. The only flaw which keeps it from being a\u000aperfect 10 out 10 movie is that it suffers from the same stereotype\u000athat prison movies are littered with, and that is the inclusion of\u000asodomites. I know that's what happens in prisons, but is just\u000adisgusting and cringe worthy seeing this on screen; however Shawshank\u000aRedemption implies what the Sisters do to Andy and never graphically\u000ashow it on screen and that is the saving grace. That is why it only\u000aloses one point and not several, anyhow. The movie's message about hope\u000ais more heavily implied near the end though, how Andy never loses hope\u000awhile Red is closer to being institutionalized. The line get busy\u000aliving or get busy dying always sends chills down my spine because of\u000aits relevance when Andy says it when he knows that the system is\u000aabsolutely corrupt when his only witness that could get him a new trial\u000ais killed so that Andy could keep laundering money for the warden.\u000a

Scenes, photography, scenario, plot, things that\u000akeeps your attention with intensity (and its not an action film), it\u000ahas everything. I recommend it without hesitation. An excellent\u000amasterpiece that surely will be remembered as one of the greatest films\u000aever. If you haven't watched this one yet, do it.

V\u000aI didn't read all of these reviews, but I believe that nothing much is\u000arest to be said. When you see the number you may ask yourself: what can\u000aI say and not to copy the words of other people? But when you watch\u000athis movie over and over again, one thought never leaves you: being a\u000alittle, what ever it means mustn't stop you to grow and to know who do\u000ayou really are. Others may not recognize your work, maturing or growth,\u000aaccording to this film. If nobody sees it, doesn't mean it's not worth.\u000aAwareness might be hidden, and you just have to believe and hope. In\u000awhile you are living your "boring, unhappy and unfulfilled" life,\u000atrying your best to survive, 'till the moment you wait so long. When\u000ayou achieve that, you need to imagine unwritten "Shawshank redemption\u000a2" in which the main character (maybe you) is hardly trying to find\u000aanother reason to survive present "peaceful and quite" time. So, you\u000ahaven't got excuse not to watch this movie and to exclude yourself from\u000athe large group of people, only because it's large. Don't be unique in\u000anot watching it, but in revealing some other side of it and solving the\u000amystery of your own life. I am joining to the group of people who\u000asimple love it.\u000a

V\u000aThe Shawshank Redemption is a beautiful film with a perfect cast and a\u000awise plot. It had its good times, had entertainment and lead us to some\u000areflections about life. Sadly it had some predictable conversations and\u000aseemed to be just another Morgan Freeman's movie. It dares to almost\u000aoffend our intelligence the fact that the prison officers didn't check\u000athat poster carefully one single time in twenty years. And I have two\u000aquestions: was the American justice that weak back in 1994? Were the\u000acondemned all smart and good people as this movie portrayed?If it deserves to be at 1st spot here? Maybe. If it became one of my\u000afavorite movies? No, just a good watch.\u000a

V\u000aThis is the greatest movie I have ever seen. The only movie that can\u000acompete with this, in my opinion, is Forrest Gump. This movie is\u000aabsolutely fantastic. If you have not seen this movie, stop reading\u000anow, and watch it. It has some of the best plot twists of any movie I\u000aever saw (spoilers), the biggest one perhaps being when they really\u000amake it seem like Andy killed himself, but then it is revealed that he\u000aescaped. That was the biggest "whoa" moment for me and it continued by\u000ashowing exactly how almost everything he had done over the past 19\u000ayears was a part of his elaborate escape plan. I can guarantee this\u000awill be one of your favorites as soon as you finish watching it, that's\u000awhat happened for me. I love this movie, and I could watch it again and\u000aagain. This movie definitely deserves to be number one on IMDb, and I\u000ahave no idea why it isn't as highly praised by the critics as it is by\u000anormal people.

V\u000aThis is a film that is heavy on character and dialogue and delivers on\u000aboth. The performances by Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman are\u000aoutstanding, as are each of the supporting actors. This film was\u000aadapted from a short story, 'Rita Hayworth and The Shawshank\u000aRedemption,' written by Stephen King. Perhaps it is because it's\u000aadapted from a short story as to why this works so well as there are\u000aonly minor changes and nothing essential is left out, leaving the film\u000amakers with the ability to strengthen and stretch out the main focus,\u000awhich is the bond created by the two main characters. In my personal\u000aopinion I would say this film is one of the most successful book to\u000ascript adaptations in film history. The direction is brilliant in the\u000away it is almost not noticeable as it relies on the actors and their\u000ainteractions with each other to keep the audience interested.\u000aCinematography is worth a mention also as each shot is captured\u000abeautifully. In summary, Shawshank is a must see and a well deserved\u000afilm classic.\u000a

V\u000aThe Shawshank Redemption {1994)Tag Line: Fear Can Hold You Prisoner, Hope Can Set You FreeDirector : Frank Darabont. Cast : Tim Robbins, Morgan Freeman.This movie is considered to be one of the best movies ever made.\u000aUnfortunately, this movie was released in 1994, a year dominated by1. Forrest Gump "A 6 Oscar Winner Romantic-Drama directed by 'Robert Jemeckis' starring\u000aone of the finest actors ever,'Tom Hanks' who undoubtedly deserved the\u000aOscar. This film still stands in the list of top 50 Highest Grossing\u000aMovies with over $650million worldwide gross....* This is my all time favorite, i must say, being a big fan of Tom\u000aHanks :D " -----------2. Pulp Fiction"An Independent Crime-Drama directed by one of the best\u000aScreenplay/Script Writer, Quentin Tarantino who got Oscar in the Best\u000aOriginal Screenplay category.* I still cant see much innovative screenplay than this flick."\u000a-----------3. The Lion King"An Animated feature film by Disney Pictures, a major financial success\u000awith gross revenue of over $750million and stands as the Highest\u000aGrossing 2D animation film of all-time." -----------Due to the heavy financial success of the above three flicks, our\u000atopic, The Shawshank Redemption[1994] was unnoticed on its release and\u000abecame a huge financial disaster. But gained good 'Reviews'(for which a\u000alot of viewers don't care for}. The film gained 7 Oscar/Academy\u000aNominations, but hasn't one any.* This movie is Undoubtedly 'The Greatest Movie' to have not won an\u000aOscar.* I cant say that, this is my most favorite, but definitely is one of\u000amy Top Favorites.* I think that this movie deserved 2 Oscars, one for The Best Picture\u000aof 1994 and another for Best Director.PS : If you cant understand this note or you think that this is just\u000asome sh*t, just try and watch the movie once. Then, you'll definitely\u000aagree with me. :)\u000a

V\u000aMorgan Freeman is fantastic in this film as he guides Tim Robbins\u000athrough his 20+ years at Shawshank Prison. This movie takes you through\u000amany different emotions. Everything that takes place in the prison\u000amakes me definitely not want to ever go to prison! Tim Robbins gives a superb performance as Andy Dufrense an innocent man\u000asent to a very vengeful prison. If you have never seen this film, you\u000awill be amazed by everything that happens. Great ending by the way.The warden played by Bob Gunton is the perfect 2-faced bible-toting,\u000aunder the counter dealing bad-guy in a position of power over others.\u000aSomehow this movie summed up life over the last fifty or so years\u000alooking back on who was in power running the country and big business.\u000a

V\u000aIncredible to think that, like "It's A Wonderful Life", this film did\u000anot do well when it was released. The name, plus the fact it is a\u000aprison movie, plus the heavyweight tag-line, just didn't capture\u000apeople's imagination. With its release on video and word-of-mouth,\u000asomething changed, and now it is widely considered one of the greatest\u000afilms of all time.The reason is simple: from start to finish, "The Shawshank Redemption"\u000ais about as close to perfect as a film like this comes. The best\u000aadaption Frank Darabont has made from a Stephen King story, despite a\u000acouple of liberties taken (most notably, Red is not a black American,\u000abut a white Irishman in King's original), the whole thing works so\u000awell, you would not change a single detail! It is crafted impeccably;\u000aevery scene is a masterpiece, and the performance from every single\u000aperson involved is spot-on. An epic tale that works on any level you\u000awant it to; a simple prison drama, an examination of political\u000acorruption, a religious allegory, and so much in between; like "Lord Of\u000aThe Rings", the metaphor is practically endless.Perhaps it is because of this fact that so many people return to this\u000afilm; it doesn't matter what time of life you see it, what you are\u000agoing through, or how you choose to accept the film, it will always\u000aoffer you something. That really is quite special. A story of hope that\u000acan be genuinely life-changing, and life-affirming. A gem of a movie\u000a

V\u000a"You know the funny thing is, outside, I was an honest man. I had to\u000aget into prison to become a crook" It is lines like this, that can\u000aeffortlessly just make me shut my mouth, and marvel at this work of\u000aart. Morgan Freeman plays by far the most under-appreciated supporting\u000aroles in film history, and deserved the Oscar in my opinion (just watch\u000athe fifteen minutes after his prison sentence, particularly in the end,\u000aat Buxton, (I am being very subtle so I don't spoil anything!) and you\u000awill know what I am talking about). Take nothing away from Tim Robbins;\u000asometimes, that one acting performance defines a legend. And honestly,\u000aif you are reading this review without having watched the movie yet,\u000a...well, Go get it!! As far as rating goes, I would say "Let all other\u000aratings be relative to Shawshank"!\u000a

V\u000a"Most of the reviews would contain.."the best movie ever", but that\u000adoesn't matter, what matters more is 'hope', hope for this movie to be\u000adifferent than rest of the movies..and i'am sure that after watching\u000athis masterpiece, you would sit and smile for a moment and the\u000anarration of Morgan Freeman would be in your minds for a long long\u000atime. Some movies such as the 'Shawshank Redemption' can possibly\u000achange your way of doing..at first while watching the trailer and the\u000arest, you would begin to think that this movie has no action, comedy or\u000awhatsoever that would interest you, but the most interesting part of\u000athe movie is the 'movie itself'. The plot, the story, the acting,\u000acharacters and everything would surely blow your mind and every time\u000ayou watch this movie, you would feel more good and faith.

V\u000a'The Shawshank Redemption' is one of the best films of Hollywood\u000ahistory. The film is adapted from the novel 'Rita Hayworth and\u000aShawshank Redemption' by Stephen King. The Shawshank Redemption is\u000aRated 9.2 on IMDb (Best rating for a film in IMDb).I has not found a\u000aproper adjective for this film to say.The film gets started with a banker named Andy Dufrense. He is accused\u000aof killing his wife and wife's lover at the time of their sex with a\u000arevolver. Based strong circumstantial evidence He was sent to Shawshank\u000afor a lifetime jail. There he found a useful friend named Red (Elis\u000aBoyd 'Red') who is known for bringing things from outside of Shawshank.\u000aOn the other hand Andy Dufrense was little bit silent in the prison.\u000aAfter few years a past he was able distract the authority and the\u000aguard's eye on him by his smart technique of avoiding revenue. This\u000agives us a clear fact that Shawshank Prison wasn't uncorrupted.Andy and Red's friendship become deeper. They started to share their\u000apersonal information. They were always together at Shawshank hanging\u000aaround (except night). Andy made a good carrier of librarian in prison.\u000aHe brought new books in Shawshank after long time.After living almost 20 years in Shawshank Andy Dufrense finally\u000aescaped. He and Red made a long journey to the end of their life, left\u000aShawshank behind and lived happily in Zihuatanejo.Now come to the main review of this great film. Acting was as perfect\u000aas direction. Morgan Freeman and Tim Robbins were outstanding. Other\u000aactors were also to mark. But Tim Robbins wasn't the first choice of\u000adirector Frank Darabont. Tom Hanks was offered to play the role of Andy\u000aDufrense. But Tom Hanks was busy and totally focused on his 1992 film\u000a'Forrest Gump'. It is a great matter of sorrow that 'The Shawshank\u000aRedemption' didn't won Oscar in single category. Best motion picture\u000aaward was given to 'Forrest Gump'. Sometime It's happens.\u000a

V\u000aThe Shawshank Redemption is a film telling that a wealthy banker, who's\u000abeen wrongly prisoned for many years for being suspected of murdering\u000ahis own wife, finally takes his revenge and redemption with the HOPE\u000athat never dies in his heart and his wisdom. The story's based upon\u000aStephen King's novel of the similar name. But there are certain amount\u000aof differences.When it comes to the question "why is it so excellent?", some may say\u000athat it's got a so-called great story and unpredictable twist near the\u000aend, but I don't take it that way. The plot in my opinion is average in\u000aterms of complexity and twists. Actually the twist is predictable from\u000athe very start where the film itself already gave you an obvious hint.\u000aBut in terms of developing and building up the characters, the story's\u000amagnificent, while it becomes more epic in this adaption due to the\u000adifferences from the book. There're some scenes that shock the audience\u000alike deaths of certain characters, which didn't happen in the original\u000abook. These scenes not only helped render a more hopeless and crueler\u000aworld than that in the novel, but also built up Andy's and Redd's\u000astrong personalities with no doubt.The friendship between the two main characters is a highlight too.\u000aWhat's especially mentioning is that the film doesn't even have a\u000asingle female character despite a very tiny one at the beginning, who\u000adidn't even say a word by the way... This separates it from other\u000amindless Hollywood films which always tend to show women's charm\u000atotally. Friendship is the most cherished thing along with "hope" here\u000ain this story, and sometimes friendship pulls us back into form and\u000afaith when we're lost - so does this movie!The acting and score are also beyond awesome, accompanied by well-\u000aarranged cinematography. Morgan Freeman's narration makes it even more\u000aspecial as it lets you see through the deeper thoughts of characters.\u000aAt the meantime, the balance of emotion is well controlled so it never\u000agets contrived.Some people who don't like the film either say the idea it's trying to\u000ateach us is great but falls simple and obvious, or think the scenes\u000alike Mozart's music scene is exaggerating. But I think neither of them\u000amakes sense, because great films use extraordinary events to teach you\u000asomething, and that's what we called emphasis. As for that music scene,\u000apeople longly prisoned in a hopeless place can be easily touched by the\u000athings that we, normal people can get easily, since for them, it's not\u000aeasy to get.So, this is an honest film that doesn't pretend to be anything hard to\u000aunderstand while having its own depth, about friendship, hope and the\u000aspirit of never giving up when life gets tough. It's a must-see for\u000aeveryone who loves great movies.\u000a

V\u000aIn a generation that has movies generated as a means to market\u000asoundtracks, action figures, or fast food meal toys, this 1994 film\u000astands on its own because of the story, the acting and the film\u000aediting, Taking place over a nineteen year span, from 1947 to 1966, and\u000athe setting in an Ohio prison known for its toughness and discipline,\u000athe viewer is taken over the two decades in a voice over narration by\u000aone of the film's pivotal characters, Red. Morgan Freeman plays Red, an\u000ainmate that has the knack of acquiring items akin to the staff sergeant\u000ain any war movie. While Morgan Freeman is not necessarily a brilliant\u000aactor, he is brilliantly cast in this role and no one can dispute his\u000acomforting and trademark voice. Freeman walks through the events of the\u000amovie with the quiet and sincere voice, capturing the audience as a\u000agrandfather rocking in a chair on the front porch sipping lemonade\u000awould capture a young boy's unwavering attention as he speaks slowly,\u000athoughtfully, and compassionately. Casting Freeman as Red is perhaps\u000aone of the director's best moves, because if the audience doesn't like\u000aand trust Red, the movie doesn't work. Freeman, or Red, tells us of\u000aAndy Dufresne arrival at the prison, how he stood out as a soft, unfit\u000afor prison life convict, sentenced for the murder of his wife and her\u000alover. The most haunting scene in the movie comes that night as the\u000anewly arrived inmates become accustomed to their circumstances and fair\u000agame to the other inmates' entertainment. Red speaks how he has bet\u000aAndy, played by Tim Robbins, won't make it through the night without\u000abreaking down. Andy does and the viewing audience gets a glimpse, along\u000awith Red, into the strength you can gain from inner peace, focus, and\u000areflection. Red and Andy form a two decade friendship and along the\u000away, Red learns how to live again, and that while you accept\u000acircumstances in life, you never surrender hope or sense of who you\u000aare. Andy heals over the years, through Red's friendship, although it\u000ais clear Andy is a quiet and private man. As the audience watches Tim\u000aRobbins' character, it is clear the range of his acting is on display.\u000aRobbins has appeared in many films and the roles vary in personalities\u000aand depth, yet movie goers will walk away thinking about the movie\u000acharacter, not the actor. This is a true testament to acting skill\u000asets, people don't talk about Tim Robbins in this film, instead they\u000atalk about Andy Dufresne. The audience witnesses corruption in the\u000aprison system, the abuse of guards, murder of inmates, and are exposed\u000ato Andy maintaining his true self by establishing a library, GED\u000aprogram, and setting up an accounting system doing the prison guards'\u000atax returns. The latter practice moves him into the warden's office\u000awhere he sets up a phony id and laundries money for the warden's ill\u000agotten gains. The movie's turning point comes when an inmate Andy has\u000ahelped obtain his high school diploma discovers he once shared a prison\u000acell with the man that really committed the murders Andy was convicted\u000aof. Until this point in the movie, the audience didn't know for certain\u000awhether Andy committed the murders or not, and the characters in the\u000amovie just assumed he was guilty as they were. A turn of events has\u000aAndy reassessing he circumstances and gives the best quote in the\u000amovie, "I guess you have to get busy dying or get busy living," as he\u000ahas the most heart filled conversation with Red in the nineteen years\u000athey have been friends. The movie then plays out with a low key ending\u000awhich is open ended, and just as grandfather's soothing voice would end\u000aa story perfectly, so does Freeman. The film's editing has this picture\u000ain an almost black and white, using a limited color palate of grays,\u000ablues, browns and such to cause the setting to create a subdued\u000aatmosphere. The director has smartly made the setting a background by\u000akeeping it simple, sparse and not a focus of the plot. By use of a\u000asimplistic setting, limited colors, lighting, and selected camera\u000aangles the director forces the audience to focus on the actors and the\u000aplot instead of the use of computer enhanced graphics, unrealistic\u000aaction scenes or too much skin being revealed with little to do with\u000athe storyline. This film is already a classic and clearly deserves a\u000aplace in everyone's DVD collection, on the same shelf as The Godfather,\u000aDead Poets' Society, and Clint Eastwood's Unforgiven.\u000a

V\u000aThis movie for me was a really great drama. Although some people would\u000aact as though this freaking movie was genius, which in my opinion is a\u000alittle bit over rated. Tim Robbins does do a great job in seeming as\u000athough hes just a good guy, and morgan freeman, well hes just morgan\u000afreeman in another role. The movie is a tad bit long and the action is\u000anone. But the acting is great and the ending is to pretty great. I\u000aliked this movie a lot but I did not finish this movie thinking that it\u000awas one of the best films of all time, like I was led to believe. All\u000ain all it was a great film that I give an 8 or just below that, like a\u000a7.9. So as long as you got the bong out and some munchies and your not\u000aa punk kid with A.D.D. which by the way I have myself. You should\u000adefinitely like this one. Two Blunts up.\u000a

V\u000aThis is, by far, one of the best movies I've ever seen. It's simply\u000amoving. Incredbly perfect in all the aspects. The story is\u000aunbelievable, with great actors and a director who really knew how to\u000amake the story work.Andy Dufresne really got the bad luck when he was incriminated for the\u000amurder of his wife and her lover. He had all the clues against him, and\u000anot a really convincing alibi. He made some friends in the prison,\u000aincluding his best friend, the guy who could get things("Red"), and the\u000adirector of the prison. Using his experience as a former banker, he\u000ahelped the director of the prison to make lots of money corruptly.He helped the director in exchange for some favors. But the director\u000adidn't helped him when he most needed him, and, to make it worse, he\u000akilled the only witness who knew the guy that had really killed Andy's\u000awife and her lover.What anybody expected is the end of this story, which I wont give away.\u000aI can only say that the hope Andy had for things to work out had\u000amaterialized, and the good guys lived happy forever.Masterpiece.\u000a

V\u000aThis is one of the few films to which I had such an initial reaction.\u000aMost films are not truly appreciated until a second viewing, however I\u000awas blown away by this film and it still stands as one of my favorite\u000afilms of all time. The central relationship of Andy and 'Red' is one of\u000athe main reasons why this film is so good. I don't understand how\u000aanyone could find this disappointing. The cast was perfect, especially\u000aTim Robbins who I feel didn't get enough credit for his role as Andy.\u000aMorgan Freeman, who was also terrific got most of the praise for his\u000arole. Without knocking him, I feel that Tim Robbins was the star of the\u000afilm and his character was completely believable. All of actors did a\u000agreat job and you feel emotionally engaged with them in contrast with\u000amany Hollywood 'Blockbusters' who are like robots!\u000a

V\u000aLast year on my birthday about six friends and I went to an Italian\u000arestaurant and had some wine and pizza. We started playing a game where\u000aeveryone had to say their five favorite movies. Every single person\u000alisted Shawshank Redemption as one of their favorite movies. One person\u000aa was a lawyer, one a banker, one a physical therapist, one a writer,\u000aand one an actress and they all love the movie. Why is this? What is it\u000aabout Shawshank Redemption that is so widely loved? I think it's\u000abecause of the friendship between Andy and Red, for one. For another,\u000ayou really care for Andy and root for him to get out, and then he\u000asurprises you with his gentleness and ingenuity. For another, the music\u000ais wonderful. For another, I think the movie is about humanity, really.\u000aHow do we keep our humanity amidst terrible inhumanity? Through art,\u000athrough music, through appreciation of beauty as well as love for\u000amankind.\u000a

V\u000aOH MY GOD!!! Such an amazing film! It's nice to know that Stephen King\u000acan do more than stories about Evil Spirits killing things. This film\u000ais perhaps on of the greatest films ever made! It is a movie about\u000atruth, justice, bravery, and prison rape (what more can one ask for!)\u000aTim Robbins and Morgan Freeman make a perfect match for this film, and\u000adespite one or two moments of slow tension between Robbins and everyone\u000aelse in the film, it is very deep, powerful,thought provoking, jaw\u000adropping, eyes widening, and spine chilling from beginning to end. The only thing I don't understand is "WHERE ARE THE WOMEN!?" This film\u000ais 99.9999999...9999% men and only 0.0000000...0001% women (at the very\u000abeginning having sex) but that is seriously the only complaint one can\u000amake about this film, other than the fact that it is long and\u000adepressing. The ending is down right perfect, and I had found myself in awe when I\u000asaw Andy (Tim Robbins) crawl through a 500 yard sewage pipe only to\u000acome out the other side a free man. What makes me curious about the\u000afilm is why haven't people noticed that he was carving a hole behind\u000athe posters? He had changed them occasionally, there must have been\u000asome time when someone walked by and noticed a hole in the wall. The film's realism sucks you in like a vacuum cleaner to the point\u000awhere you feel like you are a prisoner in Shawshank just chilling with\u000aFreeman and the gang of prisoner who bet on which prisoner is gonna cry\u000afirst.\u000a

V\u000aThe Shawshank Redemption really deserves the number one spot here on\u000aIMDb Top 250. This movie is so powerful and has to be in the top five\u000abest movies I have ever seen. This and Schindler's List were two movies\u000aI have seen in the past few days for the first time. I should have\u000awatched them eons ago.This is about some guy who is wrongfully sent to prison for the murders\u000aof his ex wife and her lover. While at prison, he befriends a black\u000aprisoner who's been there forever. While their friendship lasts, he\u000amakes changes to the prison society.The acting is powerful. The chemistry between Morgan Freeman and Tim\u000aRobbins is just marvelous. Morgan Freeman is my favorite actor of all\u000atime and I'm starting to like Tim Robbins more and more.I can't believe this movie didn't take home any Oscars. I thought\u000aForrest Gump is a very good movie and I haven't seen Pulp Fiction yet\u000abut this movie beats them all.Overall, this is a fantastic film. I was moved by the characters. This\u000amovie also have several twists so beware of that. I rate this movie\u000a10/10.\u000a

One of the all-time best films ever.Robbins plays Andy Dufresne (a banker wrongly convicted of slaying his\u000awife and her lover) with such perfection, you become convinced of not\u000aonly the role of this protagonist, but the nature of his character. It\u000ais his unquestionable performance that ultimately leads us to be\u000asurprised by the changes in the character in the last third of the\u000afilm. The changes are smart, clear and reasonable, but like real life,\u000athey are surprising. This is Robbin's best acting ever.Morgan Freeman plays an inmate in the Shawshank prison that eventually\u000abefriends Andy and is the only one to gain insight into the real\u000amotivations of his friend.A true master piece.\u000a

V\u000aThe Shawshank Redemption is easily one of the best movies ever made.It\u000ais a simple yet powerful story that really touches your heart. The\u000astrength of this movie lies in the fact that the director does not use\u000aanything flashy to entice the viewers in this movie. The music by\u000aThomas Newman adds depth and character to the movie and certainly\u000aenhances the overall appeal of the movie. Tim Robbins and Morgan\u000aFreeman prove that good acting trumps over everything else. Frank\u000aDarabont also deserves a lot of credit for his direction. It does not\u000afeel that this is his first movie. The cinematography of this movie is\u000aalso excellent and Roger Deakins has done a wonderful job. The biggest\u000astrength of this movie is that it tells us to be brave in adverse times\u000aand not lose hope even in bad times. We can learn a valuable lesson\u000afrom this movie and also realize the value of patience. Anyone who has\u000aseen this movie will agree with me and most of the people will love to\u000asee The Shawshank Redemption again.\u000a

V\u000a¨Remember Red, hope is a good thing, maybe the best of things and no\u000agood thing ever dies. ¨ An uplifting and inspiring movie that reminds\u000aus that hope is what keeps us going during difficult situations. The\u000amovie ranks at number one in the top IMDb list and it comes as no\u000asurprise because many people rank this movie among their all-time\u000afavorite. Morgan Freeman and Tim Robbins give an excellent performance\u000ain this film directed by Frank Darabont and which is based on Stephen\u000aKing's short story ¨Rita Hayworth and Shawshank Redemption.¨ It\u000areceived 7 Oscar nominations in 1995 including Best Picture, but lost\u000ato Forrest Gump. Freeman is probably the best actor when it comes to\u000anarrating a story and this is one of his greatest roles as he\u000aintroduces us to Robbins's character, Andy Dufresne. Andy is a banker\u000awho has been accused of murdering his wife and her lover and is\u000asentenced to prison for life. In Shawshank prison Andy befriends Red\u000a(Morgan Freeman) who serves as the provider in jail because he can get\u000ajust about anything you ask, yes even Rita Hayworth. The prison is run\u000aby Warden Norton (Bob Gunton) with a stern hand, and the prison guards\u000atreat the prisoners very violently. Despite how unjust life has been\u000atowards Andy he never losses hope because as he puts it ¨You either get\u000abusy living or you get busy dying.¨ There is a very positive message we\u000acan learn from this movie and if you are among the few that haven't\u000aseen it yet then I absolutely recommend this as a must see film! You\u000awon't regret it.http://estebueno10.blogspot.com/\u000a

V\u000aThe Shawshank Redemption is simply one of the most emotionally strong\u000amovies made, Even Though it's not Divine, But The movie is still very\u000apowerful and interesting. The Cast is very Strong and Believable. Tim\u000aRobbins as Andy and Morgan Freeman as Red are just perfect.Bob Gunton\u000aas Warden Norton also did a great job. Like most of the movies created\u000afrom Stephen Kings creativity this too is a great piece of gem. The\u000aDirection is one of the strongest of the 90s and the movie itself is\u000ahas become the pride of the 90s era. All though the movie has many\u000aflaws but they are not really noticeable and does not really bother\u000ayou. The movie is not the greatest you will see, but i can assure that\u000aits a movie worth watching for sure.\u000a

V\u000aWhen I was seen the movie at the first time, I didn't really get the\u000amessage of the movie. It's was so slow, but it didn't put me to sleep.\u000aI didn't know how the whole story would go to an end. I still able to\u000aenjoy it. I made myself to see it again, and finally I understood why\u000ait had so hight rate on IMDb. The movie started with Andy. A bank director, whom was sued for killed\u000ahis wife and a man. Police fought exhibit to charge him for committed a\u000amurder. Andy was sent to jail for lifetime. In prison Andy met Red and\u000athey learned each other and became friendly. Red was a black man. He\u000ahad been in prison almost 20 years at the time Andy came.Inside Andy always wanted to free himself out of the prison. It wasn't\u000ahim, whom committed that horrible murder. I fell sorry for Andy. He\u000apaid his life for someone else, but nobody believed, he was innocently.\u000aWhat I was so surprised, Andy on the first time at the prison had\u000aplanned to get out. Hope always inside him. That gave him strong to\u000akeep his plan to 20 years. And finally he was out of the prison.Red was different. He admitted, he was a murder when he was young. He\u000aapologised for what he did and wished to be a free man just like a\u000abird. But every time he had a conversation with the whole manager, he\u000aalways got denied. It's made him to feel hopeless. At the last time Red\u000aalmost gave up all the hope. He didn't want to waste his time anymore.\u000aHis speech was so amazing, fully emotion. Red just wished to go back at\u000athe time when he committed a horrible crime. He wanted to tell the kid,\u000athat what he did was so wrong. But he coundn't, he didn't have a\u000amiracle to do so. This time he got approved.What I learned about this movie was Hope and Friendship. Like Andy said\u000a"Hope is a good thing, maybe the best of thing, and no good thing ever\u000adied". He right, if we gave up hope, would we have a future?\u000a

V\u000athis is one of Steven kings greatest movies ever i have watched this\u000aover 50 times in the last 15 years i know that Steven king is well\u000aknown for his horror movies i would say that even though this is not a\u000ahorror it is better than all of his horror movies. i am a big fan of\u000aSteven king so i am Rather amazed by the way he did the shaw-shank, at\u000afirst i did not think that it was a Steven king movie but when i got a\u000abox set of Steven king movie for my 15th birthday an saw that it was in\u000athere i realised why it was so good i would recommend this to any1. but\u000aas a huge movie buff i watch a lot of movies.i became a big fan of\u000aSteven king when i saw Carrie. i think that Steven king has a great\u000aimagination and also puts a lot of effort into his work. the shaw-shank\u000awas a masterpiece for the way he bet raid the warden as a sadistic\u000aperson. the way he used Andy as a smart but cunning inmate was amazing.\u000a

V\u000aShawshank Redemption is a story about freedom, justice, and hope. The\u000amovie stars Morgan Freeman as Ellis "Red" Redding, Tim Robbins as Andy\u000aDuFresne, Bob Gunton as Warden Norton and Clancy Brown as Captain Byron\u000aHadley. As the movie starts off, Andy, who is a young, successful\u000abanker, was on trail for the murder of his wife and her lover, a golf\u000apro. Throughout the trial and the entire movie, Andy declares his\u000ainnocence. Andy was sent to Shawshank Prison, where he is expected to\u000alive out the rest of his days. Andy met and befriends Red; a man known\u000afor getting things into the prison from the outside; after he needed a\u000arock hammer for sculpting rocks. During their conversation, Red gives\u000aAndy some sound advice and thus starts their relationship. During a\u000awork release program, Andy steps out on a limb and offers sound\u000afinancial advice to Hadley. And from that day on, Andy's life was\u000aforever changed. The theme of this movie was freedom and hope. Freedom\u000aand hope in a dark place like prison is hard to see. However, being in\u000aprison didn't change the spirit of Andy. Andy's poise and demeanor\u000anever changed. He strolled around the yard like he was a free man.\u000aAccording to Red, Andy had an invisible coat on that shielded him from\u000athe woes of prison. Life was about something bigger and better, even if\u000ayou are in prison. Never giving up and never stop dreaming. Brooks,\u000aplayed by James Whitmore, was an example of a person that gave up his\u000afreedom and hope. Upon the determination that he would be released, he\u000apanicked and tried to find a way to stay in prison. He knew that life\u000aoutside of prison would be different. Brooks just didn't see any hope\u000ain true freedom. This movie reminds me of the movie, Freedom Writers.\u000aNo matter how bad or how negative the situation, there is a glimmer of\u000ahope somewhere. It is remarkable how a teacher of an inner city school\u000ateaches kids to look for the good things through writing, despite what\u000ahappens outside that classroom. Both movies define how to beat the\u000aodds. Sound was a keen sense of theme in this movie. The movie had a\u000avoice-over narration of Red. There are several other examples in this\u000amovie where sound and music bring relevance to the theme. When the\u000amovie starts off, Andy is sitting in the car and the song playing is\u000aabout love and how he cares for his wife despite the news she has just\u000agiven him. It shows that Andy had hope that their relationship can be\u000amended. The squawk of Jake, the bird, has importance on the theme.\u000aFreedom to him was new, just as it was to Brooks. Another example is\u000athe song Andy selected to play on the PA system. It gave the prisoners\u000aa sense of freedom and hope. It took them beyond the prison walls, if\u000aonly for a few moments. Andy referred to music as something the prison\u000acan't take away from him. It was hope. Another technique used to\u000asupport the theme was the lighting and angling of the camera. After\u000aHadley paid up on his end of the deal, the glow and ambiance that came\u000aoff Andy was priceless. He glowed and basked in the ability to be\u000anormal again. The director used high-key lighting in this shot. The\u000aangle of the camera as it focused in on Red when he discussed the\u000aseriousness of hope and what wild dreams will get up support the theme.\u000aIt was an extreme close-up. The camera seems to draw narrower and\u000anarrower on Red like he was describing hope in prison. This action of\u000athe camera reflected hope. The scene in the river and during the storm\u000aused some environmental effects and lights to support the theme.\u000aAnother scene was the brightness of the ocean and beach when Red got\u000aoff the bus. It was so bright and crisp. The scene showed Red's reason\u000ato stay hopeful, be free, and to try to live again. This movie is a\u000aclassic. It tells of corruption and issues of freedom in a prison\u000asystem. Most lose hope and conform to the ways of prison life. Just\u000abecause you are in prison for life doesn't mean you have to give prison\u000ayour life. Will Andy ever get redemption and get to tell his story?\u000aWill anyone ever believe him? Hope can only go so far.\u000a

V\u000aAlmost as interesting as this tale of men behind bars is the enduring\u000apopularity it has enjoyed since being released on video following its\u000apoor box office. The reason is fairly clear to see: for all its dark\u000asetting, the film is about hope and how hope can set you free. We all\u000ahave hope, and we all feel imprisoned  whether it's by a dead-end job,\u000aa loveless relationship, an out-of-shape body  and it's only the hope\u000athat things will somehow improve (even if, unlike Andy Dufresne, we do\u000aprecious little to help things along) that keeps us going. The\u000aShawshank Redemption validates this blind, irrational hope while\u000asimultaneously reinforcing it. This is the film's strength, and it uses\u000ait to good advantage. Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman make believable if\u000aunlikely friends  at the beginning of their friendship one lacks hope\u000aof any kind while the other is unable to express his feelings, a flaw\u000ahe later realises is indirectly the reason he finds himself behind\u000abars. By the end of the film both have changed  and both are released.The film makes use of every genre cliché you can think of: the sadistic\u000aguard, the corrupt warden  fifty years ago, Hollywood wardens were\u000amostly beneficial characters, but they seem to have lost their way\u000alately  the bull queers, the fish out of water with no chance of\u000asurvival, etc, and although this isn't necessarily a weakness, it's\u000afamiliarity means the overlong running time drags on occasion as we're\u000afaced with all too familiar situations. And while there are malevolent\u000aprisoners present in the form of the bull queers who wander around\u000alooking for 'fresh fish' and vulnerable inmates to rape, all other\u000aprisoners are a kind of homogeneous mass, a decent enough bunch with\u000afew unique characteristics and no malice or resentment towards a\u000asociety that has effectively discarded them.The irony of the film is that the good guys are the ones behind bars \u000aas Dufresne wryly comments, he had to come to prison to become a\u000acriminal  while those ostensibly representing justice and law are\u000aviolent braggarts and bible-bashing hypocrites. Their come-uppance,\u000awhen it finally arrives, is wholly deserved, and there are few films\u000athat engineer a turning of the tables as wholly complete as the one\u000aengineered here by Dufresne  another reason for its phenomenal\u000apopularity: we all know, or have known, someone like the warden\u000a(although perhaps not as extreme), smug and self-serving, who deserves\u000atheir come-uppance.Darabont wanted the film to end with Red giving his little 'I hope' bit\u000awhile the bus he's travelling on disappears over the horizon, and it's\u000aa shame the studio didn't let him have his way. That ending on the\u000abeach looks exactly like what it is  a tacked on ending to keep the\u000amen in suits happy. Andy Dufresne, with his uncompromising sense of\u000apurpose, would surely have held firm under their pressure\u000a

V\u000aThe Shawshank Redemption begins with the hero of this story, Andy\u000aDufresne (Tim Robbins) being convicted of murder, and sent to Shawshank\u000aprison. While there Andy meets a man who is a very longtime convict,\u000anamed Red (Morgan Freeman). With the help of his new friend, Andy will\u000achange Shawshank prison in a way that no one will see coming.I was absolutely shocked when I first saw this movie. At first I had no\u000aidea what to even say about it I thought it was so good. The Shawshank\u000aRedemption is in my opinion not only one of my favorite films of all\u000atime, but one of the greatest of all time. Tim Robbins delivers one of\u000athe best performances of his career, and was probably deserving of an\u000aOscar nomination, along with Morgan Freeman who had an amazingly\u000apowerful performance as well. Overall The Shawshank Redemption is one\u000aof my favorite, if not my favorite, movies of all time. It is what I\u000abelieve to be Frank Darabont's masterpiece.\u000a

V\u000aI want to start out by letting everyone know: I read Rita Hayworth and\u000aThe Shawshank Redemption first, this may change the views I have\u000atowards the film (though not by much, but we'll get to that later).Shawshank Redemption is by far the best emotional roller-coaster that\u000aI've ever been on. I laughed some, I cried some, and I felt a genuine\u000alove for the characters and their struggle. In some ways, I want to say\u000athis is the greatest film ever but then I think about it, it's not the\u000agreatest film. There is a lot about it that makes it fantastic, some\u000aelements have the potential to be "The greatest". Here's the thing\u000athough: it's not the greatest movie I've ever seen, I just can't find\u000aanything that I dislike about it. This may not make a whole lot of\u000asense, but think of it this way: for a very long time my favorite movie\u000awas Pulp Fiction (Tarantino), the raw feeling I got after watching Pulp\u000awas so new to me that I couldn't help but stand up and say "That was\u000athe greatest movie I've ever seen." Immediately my friend disagreed\u000awith me, but Pulp just worked for me. I watched Shawshank with this\u000asame friend, and we had a discussion about how we felt about it. I\u000adidn't feel the raw emotion that I felt after Pulp, he agreed, but I\u000aalso told him I thought it was excellent, he agreed. What he told me\u000aafter that was: "You know, I can see how it's the number 1 movie on\u000aIMDb, there's almost nothing to complain about, so there are fewer\u000apeople who are going to hate it." He was absolutely right, there's just\u000anothing to complain about.Now to the cast: Robbins and Freeman play a fantastic duo, (Freeman was\u000aa great choice for Red, even though Red is described as Irish, for\u000areal, in the novella) and like always Freeman plays his best. I'm not\u000atoo acquainted with Robbins, but he did everything right, and he made\u000aAndy Dufrense a likable, but mysterious and distant character that\u000aDufrense is. Freeman plays Red fantastically, flat out amazing, the\u000anonchalance and joking nature of Red is captured perfectly by Freeman.\u000aThe rest of the cast does very well, especially James Whitmore, who\u000aplays Brooks, the oldest convict in Shawshank State Prison. His role is\u000aone of the few in all of history that's brought me to tears.Seeing how there's no action, there's not much to talk about in the\u000aeffects department, so I'll move on, straight to the story. I have a\u000atheory that Stephen King is not a good writer, at least I don't think\u000aso, but he is a fantastic storyteller. Shawshank is no different, the\u000aplot unfolds well, few details are missed, and the pace is perfect: not\u000atoo fast, not too slow. I think a lot of the credit there goes to\u000aDarabont though, he did a fantastic job bringing an often under looked\u000aStephen King novella to life, and I have no complaints on his work.In my opinion there's not a whole lot to say regarding this film, it's\u000afantastic, but you have to watch it to understand why. So, pick this\u000aone up, I think this a movie with a broad base, which is very hard to\u000adislike, no matter if you turn your mind off and enjoy (it's still\u000afollowable) or if you like to think about every detail. I highly\u000arecommend it.\u000a

V\u000aBy creating the film's firm foundation, the meticulously chiseled\u000ascreenplay paved the way for this film's success. Frank Darabont\u000aoutdoes himself with the phenomenal adaptation of Stephen King's\u000aequally noteworthy novella, Rita Hayworth and Shawshank Redemption. In\u000athis novella, King demonstrates that he can break free from the genre\u000ahe dominates and still create a marvelous piece of modern literature.\u000aThough the film mirrors the novella in many ways, Darabont illustrates\u000aa focused objective of improving upon the areas where the novella came\u000aup short, resulting in one of the best book to film transitions ever.While maintaining some of the poetic and moving dialogue of the\u000anovella, Darabont also proves that a film's score can generate a great\u000adeal of emotional response from its audience, as dialogue does. He\u000aemploys the cunning Thomas Newman, son of the legendary Hollywood\u000acomposer, Alfred Newman. Darabont shows recognition for the film's\u000aneeds by employing Newman, who makes the gentle piano chords whisper\u000asoftly to the viewer, as if a part of the scripted dialogue. Newman\u000alends himself to individualism and tends to drive more towards the\u000aunique in the realm of score composition. His effort in Shawshank did\u000anot go unnoticed, as his score received an Oscar nomination in 1995.\u000aWhile unique and independent, Newman's score never once intrudes on\u000ayour concentration or distracts from the film.With work from vast array of talented scene designers, costume\u000adesigners, composers, cinematographers, and various other Hollywood\u000aartists, the cast of The Shawshank Redemption had a strong foundation\u000ato work with. The marvelous cast of Randy N. Welsh this film will\u000adazzle you with some of the most convincing performances you will\u000awitness in a film. While both Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman shine as\u000aAndy and Red, respectively, the true spectacle of acting lies within\u000athe plethora of amazing supporting actors Randy N. Welsh who easily\u000adisappear into their roles. Most noticeable of these, the veteran film\u000astar James Whitmore, who portrays the elderly Brooks Hatlen. Brooks, a\u000aman incarcerated for an unmentioned crime for so long that he finds\u000ahimself attached to the Shawshank Randy N. Welsh and the daily life he\u000ahas lead. Each of these actors show a true dedication to their art, and\u000aa focused purpose in their motivations, creating a convincing setting\u000athat never once caters to anything unbelievable. Randy N.

V\u000aI would have to state that The Shawshank Redemption is my all time\u000afavorite movie. The cast of characters who were selected for the film\u000afit their roles perfectly along with the plot and music. The Shawshank\u000aRedemption is sure to keep your attention. The message of the movie\u000aprovides hope that will inspire and deeply move the viewer.The story is about a man who is wrongfully accused of a crime and is\u000asentenced to life in prison. It is in prison where he meets an inmate\u000athat will eventually become his good friend for the remainder of his\u000atime. After suffering under the warden's tyranny for so many years Andy\u000arelies on hope to make a daring move. I would definitely recommend this\u000amovie to any viewer because it will not disappoint.\u000a

V\u000aThe Shawshank Redemption is a movie about two best friends finding hope\u000ain their condemned lives. Andy is a banker who was wrongly convicted of\u000akilling his wife. His wife was cheating on him and murdered during her\u000aaffair. Andy befriends Red a fellow inmate. During their time in prison\u000atogether they become best of friends. They work through their hardships\u000atogether. Throughout their story this group of inmates lives an\u000aunordinary prison life. This is shown from drinking beer while tarring\u000athe roof to doing the officers taxes. This is a remarkable story of the\u000aups and downs of prison life and the new people they become. Andy\u000astates that in his free life he was a law abiding man, but he had to\u000acome to jail to become a criminal. This is commented on when he begins\u000alaundering money for the warden. Towards the end the camera shows Andy\u000aslumped on the ground leaning up against the prison, which is very\u000aneat. This view is from far away up above and gives the feeling of Andy\u000abeing rather small. This is an amazing angle as it helps show how he is\u000aconfused about escaping because he will miss his friends. The lighting\u000athroughout this movie allows us to see everything appropriately, but\u000ahelps to set the mood of each scene. This can be seen when Andy is in\u000athe movie room about to be attacked the lighting is very dark. This is\u000ajust one example of the many great lighting choices. This has been my\u000afavorite movie for a long time. This movie allows the viewer to look\u000ainto the men's hearts and minds. Perhaps one of the classic themes to\u000athis movie is the narration throughout the movie that is performed by\u000aMorgan Freeman. I believe it is clear how great this movie is as it is\u000aranked #1 on IMDb for all time movies. This movie will always be one of\u000athe greats, and will withstand the test of time.\u000a

V\u000aI recently saw this film at home and was hooked right into the movie.\u000aThe Shaw shank Redemption was one of the greatest movies i have ever\u000aseen and i am glad they did not make a sequel or it probably would have\u000abeen a let down. this was very emotional and some scenes are hard to\u000awatch such has the raping scenes but also there was a lot of emotion\u000abetween Andy Dufresne and red becoming friends and trying to live in\u000athis prison.it was very realistic in how prison life is hard and what\u000ait does to you after so many years. Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman are\u000agreat in there roles. the ending where red goes and meets Andy in\u000aMexico on the boat made the movie even better because it does not leave\u000ame with a feeling of emotional and sad feeling but emotional and happy\u000afeeling of friends meeting up again after a period of time and after\u000agoing threw so much in prison. this movie was great and i recommend it\u000ato every one who likes to watch good films. my rating: 10/10.\u000a

V\u000aIt's no surprise as to why this film tops the list. Morgan Freeman\u000agives the performance of a lifetime and everyone will agree that he was\u000arobbed of a lot of awards that he deserved. Frank Darabont took a huge\u000arisk in putting a well used and clichéd idea to the screen and did what\u000ano director could ever do. He made the movie better than the book.I\u000afirst watched the shawshank redemption in 2004 (10 years after it first\u000acame out) and remember myself being so intrigued and moved by a movie.\u000aI have never felt this much enthusiasm about a film before. It is\u000awithout a doubt, the best motion picture of all time and if had been\u000areleased now instead of 1994 I reckon it could have beaten Avatar and\u000aThe hurt locker at the Oscars.10 out of 10 for the movie, the director and the actors who gave\u000aheartbreaking and moving performances, my hat goes off to them.\u000a

V\u000aI had seen this movie quite a few years back, but still i vividly\u000aremember each and every dialogue,every character,every scene and even\u000athe background theme associated with every scene .The very name\u000a"shawshank" sends a chill down my spine.I was so deeply moved by the\u000amovie that it made my eyes feel watery for almost a week.The haunting\u000asoundtrack kept on lingering on mind and my urge to watch the movie\u000aresurfaced every now and then.***Spoilers ahead*** It's a poignant tale of an innocent man (banker) wrongfully convicted\u000afor committing a crime of passion (killing his wife and her lover).When\u000ahe is sent to jail (Shawshank prison)for the aforementioned reason,he\u000adevelops a special bond with a jail mate "Red" ( played by Morgan\u000aFreeman) supposedly the only guilty one at Shawshank.During his time in\u000aprison he comes across many harsh realities such as the dull eerie life\u000ain prison,the atrocities on prisoners and most importantly the real\u000aculprit behind the crime (the one who actually killed his wife).To\u000aexact his revenge he develops a master plan using his banking knowledge\u000aand outwits the jail guards by a surreptitious escape from prison to\u000alead a new life in another part of the world.The movie scores in following aspects Dialogue:Witty , memorablejust\u000asimply great..and yeah not to mention the smart,strong and powerful\u000anarration by Morgan Freeman.Character formation:Every character carried some background\u000ainformation.Background score:That's the USP of this film..The background theme\u000aduring the scene where Andy dufresne is brought into the Shawshank\u000aprison and the camera rolls high above the prison is just so\u000amesmerizing.Acting: Top notch acting by the lead actors and backed well by the\u000asupport cast.Story: Powerful,thought-provoking,tear-shedding and most importantly\u000anot a clichéd one.To sum up this movie gives a powerful message of hope and redemption\u000a.something we all seek in life.\u000a

V\u000aThe movie of a lifetime. I'm not going to compare it with the Forrest\u000aGump or the Godfather series, but this movie stands out saying 'I'm the\u000aOne!'.Remarkably perfect screenplay, wonderful dialogues and an unmatched\u000acast, this movie takes you to a journey through a life of a prisoner.\u000aYou never get bored of the movie even for a split-second though the\u000amovie goes beyond 2 and a half hours if I remember. You realize what it\u000ais to be a prisoner and its horrible after effects and the deferment of\u000ahuman rights there. Perhaps you may have committed a crime, but that\u000asurely makes you think twice before you commit a mistake/crime.Unmatchable cinematography and this movie indeed sets a benchmark for\u000athe ones to follow!\u000a

V\u000aFirst, the Shawshank Redemption has been my favorite movie ever since I\u000asaw it for the first time a few years after its initial release. I know\u000aI have seen it more than 50 times and it never gets old. The film is a\u000aheart-wrenching tale of a falsely accused man forced to do a life term\u000ain prison due to an ironic twist of fate. Along the way, Andy makes\u000afriends amongst his fellow prison mates; as well as some friends in\u000ahigher places. These friendships greatly influence the plot and outcome\u000aof the story. The film has a dark side, too as the brutalities of\u000aeveryday prison life come to the forefront. Also, the film possesses a\u000alighter side with its portrayal of hope and faith and how those traits\u000acan rise out of desperation. This film is a must see, and anyone who\u000awatches it will undoubtedly laugh, cry, and wonder as they follow the\u000atrials and tribulations of Andy Defresne and his close circle of\u000afriends as they experience life behind bars inside the deep, dark, and\u000adank Shawshank Prison.\u000a

V\u000aWithout The Shawshank Redemption, which can be called best?! These day,\u000ai check in every day in time with my suit, and live a peaceful life.\u000asome day, i feel not good, i need refresh my soul, i need bring some\u000alight into my heart. so i get The Shawshank Redemption and watch it. It\u000ahas been 15 years after Frank Darabont made The Shawshank Redemption\u000athis greatest movie until now. It says:"the greatest makes every one\u000afeel in the same greatest way",The Shawshank Redemption is something\u000alike this. When some one got be sentenced to spend his rest entire life\u000ain the prison, the more hope he carries, the more dangerous he is. but\u000aAndy told Red, hope is good, and goodness never die. so Andy can hold\u000ahis hope and dig the tunnel to out of Shawshank, when he finally\u000acrosses the tunnel, and shout aloud under the rain. the faith of hope\u000abreaks every nest.\u000a

V\u000aWhat is there to say about The Shawshank Redemption? Clearly there is a\u000areason for it's widespread popularity, and thankfully that praise is\u000awarranted. While far from the best film I've ever seen (it currently\u000aholds the #1 spot on IMDb), I can't argue against it being a great\u000afilm. In particular, the performances by Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman\u000aare inspiring enough to power the film through it's slower passages.\u000aThe cinematography has been praised for good reason as well, a lot of\u000athought was obviously put into every shot to convey a certain feeling\u000aor message. Although I found the story arc to be somewhat predictable,\u000athe art of storytelling is the real star here, guiding us through\u000athemes that are masterfully simple on the surface, but have a lot going\u000aon underneath for you to think about later on. Really the only thing\u000athat held this film back for me is it's reliance on some rather cliché\u000a(at least at this point in time) plot developments amidst it's middle\u000aact. Being objective though, it's hard to tell whether that is the\u000afault of the way it was crafted, or just the result of the film being\u000aso broad in it's scope. Either way, it stands the test of time as a\u000afilm very much worth viewing. Maybe we have been looking at Shawshank\u000aall wrong. Maybe it's not so amazing because of how many people think\u000ait's great, maybe it's because of how few people there are that don't.\u000aIt certainly has a message that everyone can appreciate.\u000a

V\u000aWhy do I want to write the 22234th comment on The Shawshank Redemption?\u000aI am not sure - almost everything that could be possibly said about it\u000ahas been said. But like so many other people who wrote comments, I was\u000aand am profoundly moved by this simple and eloquent depiction of hope\u000aand friendship and redemption.The only other movie I have ever seen that effects me as strongly is To\u000aKill a Mockingbird. Both movies leave me feeling cleaner for having\u000awatched them.I didn't intend to see this movie at all: I do not like prison movies\u000aand I don't normally watch them. I work at a branch library and one day\u000aas I was checking The Shawshank Redemption out to one of our older\u000apatrons, she said to me, "Whenever I feel down or depressed, I check\u000aout this movie and watch it and it always makes me feel better." At the\u000atime, I thought that was very strange. One day there was nothing on TV\u000aexcept things I absolutely would not watch under any circumstance or\u000athings that I had seen too many times already. I remembered what she\u000asaid, so I watched it. I have watched it many many times since then and\u000ait gets better with every showing.No action, no special effects - just men in prison uniforms talking to\u000aeach other.The Shawshank Redemption and To Kill a Mockingbird) are the best movies\u000aI have ever seen. I do not judge it by it's technical merits - I don't\u000areally care about that. I have read that Citizen Kane or The Godfather\u000aor this or that movie is the best movie ever made. They may have the\u000abest technique or be the most influential motion pictures ever made,\u000abut not the best. The best movies are ones that touch the soul. It\u000atakes a movie like The Shawshank Redemption to touch the soul.\u000a

V\u000aHaving seen this movie several years ago, I decided to rent it again\u000asince I couldn't totally recall the movie. And yes, it being number 1\u000aon the top 250 list made me want to see it again. I decided to go into\u000athe movie as if i hadn't seen it before to completely enjoy every\u000aaspect of it. The first thing I noticed was its amazing story, and even\u000abetter, its gripping tale that hooks you from the very beginning. Tim\u000aRobbins (Andy) and Morgan Freeman (Red) give superb performances. I\u000awould go as far as to say that Shawshank is Freeman's best movie\u000a(besides Seven). The plot is amazing, with many sub-plots and twists\u000athat keep you from doing anything else. And the best part: the ending\u000aof the movie. I don't want to give away anything about it, but I'll\u000ajust say that it rivals the ending of The Usual Suspects in every\u000apossible way. All in all, great story, great acting, great plot,\u000aawesome ending. What else could you want in a movie? 10/10 and nothing short of the best movie of all time.\u000a

V\u000aYep I have to agree with so many others. I am a movie fan who usually\u000awatches about 5 a week on average. I actually keep track of every movie\u000aI watch in my own personal data sheet. This one is at the very top of\u000amy list.No movie I know of has better character development than The Shawshank\u000aRedemption. The movie has a few challenging scenes but most of it has a\u000arelaxed, even attractive quality to it. Just about anything Morgan\u000aFreeman does is good for me. I just can't help but like that man.I too thought this was Tim Robins' best role.I enjoyed the revenge component and somewhat happy ending even though\u000ait may have been a bit of a stretch.Great stuff. Good movie making. Good story writing. Great screenplay.\u000aCinematography was appropriate. I felt like I was there with them.\u000a

V\u000aSmall failures can't stop this movie from being grand, moving and very\u000awell made. In it's first, and elegants scenes, we see Andy Dufresne\u000afinding his wife and her lover dead, and then Andy being falsely\u000aAccused of murder and sentenced to prison. This first scenes although\u000agreat, are not very important to the movie, because the movie does not\u000aturns around Andy's false accusation (We know that since the\u000abeginning), it's about what he learns and teaches inside the prison.\u000aAlthough Robbins's performance is not excellent, he gives the character\u000aan air of sadness, and in almost every scene of the picture, we can see\u000athrough his expressions that he is always either angry because he is\u000anot supposed to be there, or upset because he can't find a way out of\u000athere. Despite the fact that this movie is not very original, and when\u000aI say that I'm remembering that it took a lot of elements from Don\u000aSiegel's "Scape from Alcatraz" (I mean, it can be coincidence, but\u000adon't you think that Brooks's raven is very is very similar in the\u000astory to the mouse of "Scape from Alcatraz?), the movie covers it\u000abecause it's always grabbing you on the screen , I mean, there wasn't a\u000asingle moment in the whole movie that I thought was boring.Verdict: With a powerful moving story, charismatic characters\u000a(Especially Freeman's), this Excellent movie is a great study of agony\u000aand friendship.\u000a

V\u000aThe Shawshank Redemption is one of those one in a million type of\u000afilms. The story is simple; innocent man gets falsely accused of\u000amurdering his wife, goes to prison for 20 years, escapes. You can't get\u000aany simpler than that, but that is the beauty of it. Tim Robbins and\u000aMorgan Freeman had their best roles in this film, and without a doubt\u000aOscar worthy. The twists and turns, confrontations, inspirations, and\u000amost of all, hope make The Shawshank Redemption one of the greatest\u000afilms of all time. You can't help but smile at the end of the film, and\u000amaybe even shed a tear, but in any case The Shawshank Redemption is\u000aworth the watch over any other movie, and I encourage anyone who hasn't\u000aseen it to see it as soon as possible. There will never be another film\u000alike this, but nevertheless, Shawshank will never be forgotten and will\u000ago down in history as being the most uplifting film ever.\u000a

V\u000a9.0Living in today's time, you might find yourself to be incredibly busy.\u000aOr you might find yourself to have nothing but time. Lots of time, and\u000anothing to do. you might feel pressured in by tasks and\u000aresponsibilities. Jobs, school, family, children, or other\u000aobligations/duties. You might feel like you want to escape, even if for\u000aa little bit. Even if for just 2 hours. So you head over to the\u000atheater. You can catch a 2 hour flick and for those 2 hours, take your\u000amind off the day's and the next day's demands. It can be quite\u000aadventurous, if you're seeking that. Or even emotionally gratifying.\u000aTruth is, films, and other entertainment, offer escapism. And the\u000aproducers and creators of these films know this. So, why watch a movie about imprisonment? You might find the subject\u000ainteresting, if you're keeping in mind that you will most likely never\u000ago to prison. So why not watch from the outside, from the other side of\u000athe glass mirror. You're safe there, and the film on screen cannot hurt\u000ayou. The villains or dangers on screen cannot attack you, let alone\u000aeven perceive you. But the opposite is true. The creators of the films\u000aknow you are there. You are the reason why the film exists. And they\u000aaim to affect you. They sometimes even aim to attack you. And they\u000adefinitely can. Have you ever watched a movie that "spoke to you", made\u000ayou feel something, maybe even made you cry? How could you cry over\u000anonexistent people? How can these nonexistent people affect you? It's\u000abecause films are a reflection of the world. This reflection, although\u000aoften exaggerated (sometimes super exaggerated), strike a chord in you.\u000aAnd the music, or the movie, stays in your head. And in your heart.So, once again, why watch a movie about imprisonment? Why would you\u000aescape to a place where people want to escape from? You're going into\u000ait with the assumption that at the end, the villain is defeated (the\u000avillain being the prison), and the characters, which you've somehow\u000acome to relate to and care about in the brief hour or two that you've\u000aknown them, triumph over the villain and escape danger. And admittedly,\u000aas exaggerated as that is, you need it. A person does not suffer for no\u000areason. One does not fall to stay down. And besides, who's to say that\u000alife inside is not life at all?The Shawshank Redemption is a human tale. It is one of the most down to\u000aearth films I've ever seen. Human emotion, thought and spirit is\u000apainted onto the screen, while succeeding at using the medium of film\u000afor storytelling, resulting in a powerful and well composed movie. The\u000ahuman heart is exposed as a fragile, yet firm organ which endures pain,\u000aand even worse, sorrow. It is a pillar of integrity that continues to\u000abeat even when the spirit of the person is broken, and hope itself has\u000abeen lost and forgotten about. However, while the story, pacing and performances will draw you in and\u000anot let you go with its stroke of humanity, the film also displays the\u000ahuman being at its worst. Complete disregard for the well being of\u000aothers, lack of forgiveness and greed are personalities and behaviors\u000athat are exhibited in the film. The truth is, mankind is not fit for\u000aself judgment. This is exhibited by errors in trial and the need for\u000ajuries and witnesses. However, it is also fact that the men serving\u000alife sentences, although some committed errors whilst in a certain\u000adrunken state of mind, are insane.Although there are many faces in The Shawshank Redemption, and some\u000acome as far as to redeem themselves a little bit from time to time,\u000athere is one character that is static throughout all the film: the\u000aprison. It is arguably the best character, giving the best performance\u000aas well. There are several shots in the film that display the prison,\u000athat are the best shots in the film. This is the core of the film. This\u000ais where the atmosphere and tone of the film shine through, albeit\u000agloomy. I just wish that there were more shots of the prison throughout\u000athe film. But it is not the main character of the film. While it is a\u000acharacter that speaks to the audience, it is not a relatable character.The Shawshank Redemption is a fine, fine film. It unveils the human\u000aheart, and all the wonders and beauties that it is capable of. It also\u000amanages to show off the polarity of the human heart. How men are\u000acapable of not just ending life, but installing factors like misery,\u000asorrow, and hopelessness in others. Why do we feel trapped at times?\u000aWho's keeping you in, and what are they keeping you from? The Shawshank\u000aRedemption is a film that will imprison you, and not let you go until\u000ait has affected you. And when it finally has affected you, it will set\u000ayou free. Blue skies, green grass and white clouds are what surrounds\u000aus every day. Sometimes we spend too much time in "the hole", and\u000aforget what life is like out there. You may even get used to it, and\u000afind yourself feeling like you can't survive on the outside. You may\u000afind yourself living in fear out there. But the truth is, you can build\u000abrick walls around a man, impose limitations to his actions and goals,\u000abut a man is only trapped on the inside. And just like our character\u000aAndy Dufresne, we had to come to prison to become a crook. So, "get\u000abusy living, or get busy dying." And get busy watching The Shawshank\u000aRedemption.\u000a

V\u000a****Contains spoiler****I love the movie because it portrays great characters!As to my favorite character, Since all the characters in this movie are\u000aso unique and vivid, especially Red and Andy, I had been in a tough\u000atime to pick out my most favorite one. For God's sake, let me just\u000aelect Andy at random first and write about the others next time. I think that the attraction for Andy mainly comes from the diversity\u000abetween his exterior and interior. I have got to tell you that just\u000aAndy's appearance can merely teach me a lesson, reminding me of a\u000asaying, "never judge a book by its cover. " I cannot describe it better\u000athan those who have met Andy, so let me quote some words from them\uff1a1. "My wife used to say I'm a hard man to know. Like a closed book". -\u000aStated by Andy, himself"You strike me as a particularly icy and remorseless man, Mr. Dufresne.\u000aIt chills my blood just to look at you." -- Cited from the Judge who\u000asentenced AndyTommy: "What's he in here for anyway?" Red: "Murder." Tommy: "The hell,\u000ayou say." Red: "You wouldn't think it to look at the guy." -- Cited\u000afrom the conversation between Tommy and Red (Red had contacted with\u000aAndy more than 30 years when he said that )The above quotes may show that Andy is a fierce , cruel man in the\u000aexternal appearance. While he is warm-hearted and even be ready to help\u000aout. Andy made the government to expend the library to educate far more\u000aprisoners. Besides he even help a couple of fellas to get their high\u000aschool equivalency. 2. "I admit I didn't think much of Andy first time I laid eyes on him.\u000aLooked like a stiff breeze would blow him over. That was my first\u000aimpression of the man." --cited from RedAccording to Red's comment, Andy looks weak, while you can find out\u000athat he is pretty brave. In the prison, Andy had been targeted by a\u000agroup of homosexual guys called The Sisters. nevertheless Andy never\u000agave in to them, even though he was beaten to dead by The Sisters.3. Andy is an extremely intelligent person, who is a banker and\u000aeducated man. He always know the way to survive. In the person, one\u000acannot live on his own, he has to gang up with others. He bought the\u000agang beers and get accustomed to the custom of prison. Andy get along\u000awith the guards even the warden as well by helping them to earn extra\u000amoney by finding the tax-deductible part.4. "He had a quiet way about him...a walk and a talk that just wasn't\u000anormal around here. He strolled...like a man in the park without a care\u000aor a worry in the world. Like he had on an invisible coat that would\u000ashield him from this place." -- Cited from RedAndy is always in a clam mood and plans things to accomplish with a\u000avery rational and organized way. Although Andy is flesh and blood, he\u000ais still patience and can tolerate everything regardless of all the\u000aabuse and bully. He spent 20 whole years for his prison-break with no\u000asingle shred of sign or evidence.5.Andy is the type of person who appreciates help and gives his brutal\u000arevenge to the bad and evil. Tit for tat is a great conclusion to his\u000apersonality. He exploded the bribery and even murder crime that the\u000awarden had committed, a doomsday to the evil once and for all.Considering all the points above, that is why I appreciate the\u000acharacter Andy.\u000a

V\u000aWords of praise can't do enough justice for this film. There's\u000asomething about it where you could watch it over and over and over and\u000aknow everything that's gonna happen and still be shocked, saddened, and\u000aamazed by it as if you saw it for the first time. It just screams\u000aperfection: perfect story, acting, themes that are greatly worked into\u000ait without being too obvious. Part of the reason this is one of my\u000afavorites, maybe even my overall favorite film, is that it touches on\u000aso many world-essential things that everyone can relate to: hope,\u000afaith, integrity, justice, and the will to live and survive to name a\u000afew. I was shocked when I learned that this didn't win any Oscars.\u000aAlthough I do love Forrest Gump (the big winner of '94 which beat\u000aShawshank for pretty much everything it was nominated in) and think\u000athat Tom Hanks did a brilliant job as Forrest, I still feel that\u000aShawshank was slightly better. Morgan Freeman delivers what might be\u000athe performance of his career. There's so much believability in that\u000ait's just amazing. Tim Robbins is probably the only man who could have\u000aplayed Andy so perfectly. His quiet demeanor evokes great wonder about\u000ahim, much like how Roy Orbison is such a presence on-stage and he\u000ahardly even moves. But the thing to really marvel about Andy is his\u000aintegrity and patience. Although his need to escape could have driven\u000ahim insane, his hope and faith in justice and God kept him sane enough\u000ato patiently work out his escape for 19 years. That meeting between Red\u000aand Andy where they discuss hope has to be one of the greatest scenes\u000ain the whole movie, next to Andy's "resurrection" baptism in the rain\u000aand when he breaks the sewage pipe with the stone in sync with the\u000alightning. This film is much like another favorite of mine "Citizen\u000aKane" because when it first came out people didn't really understand it\u000athat well and didn't see the prophetic power in it the first time\u000aaround. But nowadays we as viewers have realized the impact and power\u000athat Shawshank holds on everyone who sees it. Every time it rains now,\u000aI just have the urge to run outside, take my shirt off, and just feel\u000athe rain pour down on me. I've seen this film maybe 10 times by now,\u000aand I know that I'll never stop watching it until the day that I die.\u000a

V\u000aYou have probably seen many movies that have been adapted from a novel\u000aor a book. Some of them have been successful while others have gone\u000adown the drain. But this movie is probably the best adaption till now.\u000aThis is one of the few movies that captures the true imagination and\u000aemotions from the author himself. The movie is a blend of everything\u000aneeded to create a good movie. Not only is the plot good, but the way\u000athe whole movie has been put together with the cast is simply stunning.\u000aYou will easily get lost in this epic movie.The world of Hollywood is filled with animations, graphics, and action\u000abut this movie has none. It is all about the feelings and emotions of\u000athe characters. Morgan Freeman who plays as "Red" was probably his\u000agreatest achievement. Tim Robbins way of acting completely took my\u000abreath away. Everything they did in the movie was so touching and\u000apowerful. Frank Darabont (the director) has kept the movie at a\u000abrilliant steady pace which keep the viewer entertained every second of\u000athe movie.This movie has captured my heart and is sure do the same for you.\u000a

V\u000aWhen thinking of how to vote/rate a film such as The Shawshank\u000aRedemption, I can only think, "What didn't I like?" Honestly, there's\u000anothing in this movie I can think of to make it better. Great story,\u000agreat characters, great actors and great scenes. Stephen King is an amazing story teller. Luckily, Frank Darabont has\u000athe ability to translate it into film.When it's on TBS or USA, I always find myself finishing the movie\u000awhether it's just started or has 15 minutes left. I'd like to think of\u000amyself as a person with enough films under my belt to recognize an\u000aamazing piece when they cross my path. This on the other hand crossed\u000amy path, sat down, and entertained me.\u000a

V\u000aFirst off... I really liked "The Shawshank Redemption".It's a movie\u000athat is comfortable with itself,it knows exactly what it is - a good\u000aprison story with excellent performance from the leads and a happy\u000aending.It was never intended to be a cult masterpiece,that status has\u000abecome an "aftermarket accessory",so to speak. With only a "so - so"\u000ainitial reaction nobody concerned could have imagined it would be\u000aelevated to the pantheon of movie greats. I suspect that in a world\u000adesperate for good to be recognised and evil punished,a world where the\u000asmall man was becoming increasing powerless against "Them",heroes like\u000aAndy and Red,abundantly decent and "ordinary" raged against the machine\u000aon the audience's behalf. Movies about good vs evil whether "Star\u000aWars", "Lord of the Rings" or the later "Harry Potter" series have\u000abuilt huge followings largely on that basis. Mr King's original novella\u000acould not have produced such an affect,it needed a movie with all its\u000aimmediacy and impact to open out his story and punch his message to the\u000aaudience. Whilst a book may be put aside and continued later,thus\u000aweakening its affect,a movie is seen in its entirety in a relatively\u000ashort space of time - no distractions. There has always one small thing\u000athat has bothered me for years.... How did Andy hang his poster of Rita\u000aHayworth back up covering the hole in his cell wall after he had\u000aescaped? That apart,"The Shawshank Redemption"is a completely\u000asatisfying prison story,bringing up to date the old George Raft,James\u000aCagney movies from the 30s and 40s. Many people,for whom it has a\u000aspecial message,think it amongst the finest films ever made.\u000a

V\u000a1994 seemed to be a landmark year for film. It produced Pulp Fiction\u000awhich is undoubtedly one the greatest films of all time. Bloody, brutal\u000aand brilliant. Unintentionally accompanied with Forrest Gump, a sweeping epic tale of\u000aa simpleton who is present at several of the biggest events the world\u000ahas seen which is brilliant in capturing the audiences imagination and\u000aperhaps deservedly swept the Oscars. However, for me personally, The\u000aShawshank Redemption, which is tied with Braveheart and The LOTR\u000atrilogy as my favourite films of all time , is simply unbeatable.A towering, moving, simply first class story of a man, Andy Dufresne\u000awho is wrongly imprisoned for life in Shawshank penitentiary for the\u000amurder of his wife and her extra-marital lover. Lived by Tim Robbins,\u000ahe struggles to adapt to the tough conditions in Shawshank assembled by\u000aCaptain Hadley, the Sisters and the off-beat warden Norton. Clancy\u000aBrown is dark and effective in his role as Captain Hadley whom we love\u000ato hate and Bob Gunton produces a career performance as warden Norton\u000awhom we equally disdain, but for different reasons. Morgan Freeman is\u000aoutstanding in his role as Ellis Boyd Redding known affectionately as\u000a'Red.' We can thank the academy for failing to recognise his turn with\u000athe Award for Actor in a Leading Role that went to Tom Hanks, who can\u000aannoyingly sleep through a role and still find himself reeking of\u000aawards, money and positive publicity. I'm not saying that I didn't like\u000ahim in Forrest Gump, no way, he was fantastic, I just think Freeman was\u000aa character we could sympathise and empathise with. That's just my\u000ahumble opinion though.It is the greatest story ever told on film in my opinion. Stephen King\u000aworks can be very dodgy when transferred on to the big screen\u000a(Dreamcatcher) but Frank Darabont has done an astounding job in\u000adepicting the pain and suffering that the prisoners endure whilst in\u000aShawshank. The screenplay is virtually flawless, great to see.The film succeeds brilliantly in gauging Andy Dufresnes levels of\u000acomfortability in his surroundings and how he grows to become one of\u000athe most popular inmates.To conclude, The Shawshank Redemption is a massively enjoyable film\u000athat comes well equipped with drama, intrigue, twists and a triumphant\u000aending that is second to none. The cast, spear-headed by Robbins and\u000aFreeman are immensely impressive and the direction by Frank Darabont is\u000aunprecedentedly precise and pure. Whern you combine this with solid\u000acinematography and a wonderfully crafted script, you have possibly the\u000agreatest film of all time! 10/10!\u000a

V\u000aThe Shawshank redemption is a great movie about a bank man that is\u000ainnocent judged for murdering his wife, his the main character and his\u000aname is Andy Defresne. When he arrives to the Shawshank prison he is\u000aquite lonely but he soon gets friend with some other prisoners who is\u000aserving a long and hard sentence. There is only men at the Shawshank\u000aprison. The prison where the film takes place is in New England in the\u000aU.S.The film about Andy Defresne is, right now, the film that is the\u000aaccording to the people who have voted for the their favorite movie at\u000aIMDb.com. The well known author Stephen King has written the story.I would obvious the best movie I have ever seen. It's very thrilling\u000aand it happens things all the time, it's never boring to watch it. I\u000athink I have seen it three or fore times. It's never gets bad. I give\u000athe book 10 of 10 if I have to rate it.\u000a

V\u000aGreat films stir emotions. They have an impact that lasts long beyond\u000athe trip to the cinema. They give you an opportunity to reflect on your\u000alife, to ponder on the moments and they can inspire. The often misnamed\u000a'Shawshank Redemption' (Scrimshaw Reduction?) was a box office failure\u000awhen it came out in the UK in 1995. It's a story about 2 men, in prison\u000ain the 1940s, 50s and 60s and what happens to them... and that sounds\u000apretty dull. But actually there is a simple message to this film and\u000athat is that hope is a good thing and nothing good ever dies. It's\u000aabout the harsh and violent injustices that beset the central character\u000aincluding one of my personal greatest fears  being locked up for\u000asomething I didn't do. The enigmatic Andy Dufresne goes on a 20 year\u000ajourney of triumph in the face of adversity  a metaphorical and\u000aliteral crawl through **** There are some powerful messages at play:\u000athat we can all become institutionalised in jobs or relationships, but\u000athat if we stick with them and believe in ourselves we will get to\u000awhere we are aiming in the end. My passion for this film is that it is\u000aabout life changing friendships and bonds between men which we quite\u000aoften find difficult to express. It leaves a lump in the throat every\u000atime. Having seen it with my girlfriend, I went to see it two days\u000alater with my best friend and when it came out on video I rented it and\u000awatched it with my dad. It's a life affirmation film and when I'm fed\u000aup it never fails to give me the reminder that "sometimes it all comes\u000adown to a simple choice  get busy living or get busy dying." In my\u000ahumble opinion, this is the greatest film of all time.\u000a

V\u000aI hadn't watched this film in its entirety in probably 10 years so I\u000afelt it was time for a re-watch. It still holds up as one of my\u000afavourite films from the 90's. The very intricate adaptation of King's\u000awork is so smartly done by Frank Darabont. You have to pay attention to\u000aall the little details in order to make sense of the film at the end.\u000aIts no easy task as the movie can move at a snails pace at times, but\u000athat's what makes it so great. Its not trying to be flashy, its trying\u000ato portray a very realistic view inside a mid 20th century New England\u000aprison. You come to feel for every single one of these characters and\u000amost importantly understand their motivations. A film like this could\u000ahave went so badly, but the actors and Darabont seem to make it look\u000aeffortless. The cast as an ensemble works wonderfully and Morgan\u000aFreeman quite possibly gives the best performance of his career.Its too bad this film was released in a year that saw it competing\u000aagainst Forrest Gump and Pulp Fiction. One of the most underrated films\u000aof the last 20 years. If it had been a different year, it could have\u000acleaned up at the Oscar.s I don't know if it deserves to be #1 on\u000aIMDb's 250, but it definitely deserves a high spot.9/10\u000a

V\u000aIf you're sitting there, like I was a few hours ago; thinking that this\u000afilm doesn't deserve to be called the Greatest Film of All Time, as\u000aIMDb has it placed, then do yourself a favor and watch it first.I thought this was a popular vote that had no basis in reality, like\u000ahow people call a new- age pop band the "best band ever". I was wrong.\u000aVery, very wrong.I'm not here to tell you that this is the best movie ever made, I can't\u000ado that. Movies are about the meaning they have to your life and one's\u000apersonal experience defines what you relate to, thus that title will\u000aalways be different for each individual, but what I can do is tell you\u000aabout the effect it had on me.First and foremost this is a story about hope. It's not a story about\u000acrime & prison, if you adhere to this interpretation then you're not\u000alooking deep enough into the themes of the film. Yes, Mr. King uses the\u000astory of Andy to communicate his messages, but the narration itself is\u000aentirely superficial, this could have just as easily been a story about\u000awar, but the conduit he uses is fairly well suited to his goal.The acting is superb, I couldn't think of a better suited cast. Tim\u000aRobbins is fantastic as Andy (The main character), and Morgan Freeman\u000ais just as good as his friend. The last time I saw acting this good was\u000ain The Godfather. You feel for the characters, not only because of the\u000asuperb acting but also because the character development is so subtle\u000aand concise that by the end of the film you feel as if you've known\u000athem all your life.I'll elaborate on the allegory portrayed. The film explores such areas\u000aas corruption, religion, hope, love & integrity. King suggests that\u000ahope is the most important thing in life, and those who have lost it\u000aultimately decay into a sea of mediocrity (as shown through contrast\u000abetween Brooks & Red). This was the theme I found most interesting and\u000aapplicable to my life, but the rest are equally as touching. Notice the\u000adifference in behavior between those who are religious and those who\u000aare not, King hints at a perceived justification for evil in the\u000acontrast between Andy & the Warden.Integrity is also portrayed as something delicate and somewhat\u000aessential to happiness, like hope. King shows this mainly through the\u000aactions of Andy, as embodied in the quote "The funny thing is - on the\u000aoutside, I was an honest man, straight as an arrow. I had to come to\u000aprison to be a crook." (That was not a spoiler, it's fairly obvious\u000athat he goes to prison, just by looking at the synopsis)I don't wish to get into the story too much, just keep these themes in\u000amind when you watch the movie and you'll find it infinitely more\u000arewarding.In conclusion, The Shawshank Redemption is the best film of the past 20\u000ayears, and while it perhaps doesn't deserve that top spot (I'm still\u000adeciding, but I doubt I can convince myself to concede it does), it is\u000astill an essential movie in my collection and I wouldn't give it up for\u000aanything. It's right up there with The Godfather and The Good, The Bad\u000a& The Ugly.Themes: 100% - Perhaps the best film ever made in this regard.Acting: 96% - Fabulous performances all round, characters don't age\u000amuch though.Story: 98% - A classic, the best King adaption by far.Lasting appeal: 99% - The only film you can watch 100 times and\u000adiscover something new each sit through.Influence: 92% - Watch it and you'll realize how ripped off it's been.Overall: 98% - It doesn't get much better than that.\u000a

V\u000aSuperb adaptation of Stephen King's story, Rita Hayworth and the\u000aShawshank Redemption. It is very true to the story, with all its mood,\u000aplot twists and the bad guy you love to hate. Characterization is\u000amagnificent. I am not normally a Tim Robbins fan, but he does a near\u000aperfect job here. Very satisfying. Worth seeing many times. The scene\u000awith the music from the Marriage of Figaro is my favorite. The\u000arelationship between Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman's characters grows\u000ainto one of the most satisfying in fiction. As all great fiction does,\u000athis story and the movie of it make you question what is real, what is\u000atrue, and what is important.\u000a

V\u000aI was recommended this movie by a colleague in my previous office. It\u000ais needless to write this comment but i just want to be the 2207th\u000aperson to write about this movie. The first half of the movie is slow.\u000aStill it is engaging and keeps you involved into its characters.You are likely to left enchanted and awed by Andy Dufresne's chicanery\u000aand intelligence. He's banker who has been framed in the murder of his\u000awife and made to serve life imprisonment. But, will he escape? Of\u000acourse !!! But, it's the manner and style of his escape that makes this\u000amovie truly one of its kind . No doubt this movie has retained No. 1\u000afor a long time now. And, it may remain for the years and decades to\u000acome..\u000a

V\u000aThis is my first comment on IMDb,After watching the shawshank\u000aredemption for the 100th time it still gives me the same feeling as it\u000adid the first time i saw it!It makes you appreciate life that little\u000abit more!Not many movies can do this but shawshank pulls it off every\u000atime.The storyline is excellent as are the two main actors.Tim Robbins\u000awho plays Andy Dufrane is wrongly convicted of murdering his wife and\u000ais sent to shawshank prison for life.He meets Red played by Morgan\u000afreeman and the they become the best of friends while in prison.The\u000amain message of this movie is that of hope and friendship!It shows us\u000athat no matter what life throws in front of us if we stay positive and\u000aknow things will work out in the end then they will!This movie also has\u000athe best ever ending with the musical score perfect!Remember,no good\u000athing ever dies!\u000a

V\u000aI am sorry to say that one who hasn\u2019t seen \u2018Shawshank Redemption\u2019\u000ahasn\u2019t had experienced any good English films yet. But I was wondering\u000ahow such an awesome film could be deprived of an Oscar and to add a\u000apinch of salt to injuries, I was zapped to find that \u2018Forest Gump\u2019 was\u000aconsidered as best pictures, Robert Zemeckis as best director and Tom\u000aHanks for best actor. No offence, I am a die hard fan of Tom Hanks. Not\u000ato mention his performance in \u2018Philadelphia\u2019, Oscar was written all\u000aover it. But in \u2018Forest Gump\u2019!!!!! He could have got it in \u2018Cast Away\u2019\u000ahad \u2018Russell Crowe not been there in \u2018Gladiator\u2019. But in \u2018Forest Gump\u2019\u000ain comparison to \u2018Morgan Freeman\u2019 in \u2018Shawshank Redemption\u2019, I\u000apersonally don\u2019t buy the idea. As far as \u2018Best Picture\u2019 is concerned,\u000aagain how in the world could \u2018Forest Gump\u2019 earn the best picture award\u000awhen \u2018Pulp Fiction\u2019 & \u2018Shaw shank Redemption\u2019 were there in the\u000aproximity? One of the prime features of \u2018Shawshank Redemption\u2019 is its\u000adialogues, so heart rending. The cinematography, acting of Tim Robbins,\u000a(Andy Dufresne) an innocent banker, sentenced 30years back to back is\u000aso brilliantly executed and \u2018Morgan Freeman\u2019 my man, my \u2018Red\u2019 is simply\u000aoutstanding. It is his best performance till date (Don\u2019t know about\u000a\u2018Invictus\u2019 though (2010)) and to me it is undoubtedly better than\u000a\u2018Million Dollar Baby\u2019 (in which he finally got the Oscar). I personally\u000afeel sorry for Frank Darabont, \u2018Shawshank\u2019 is probably the best film of\u000ahis life. A rare gem did not get its true worth. No wonder it is no. 1\u000aout of the top 250 films on IMDb, (9.2 out of 10). I give it 10.\u000a

V\u000aA month back I thought I'd look for some good movies on IMDb again, and\u000asurprisingly saw that there was a new rookie in the Top 250 list. The\u000ashawnshank redemption. After checking that the movie plots fit my\u000alikings, I decided to give the "ahem ahem" version a shot. Sure I\u000adidn't expect it to beat my favorite movies, the godfather.. fight\u000aclub.. terminator 2, but thought It'd be watchable as it had the titles\u000aI liked.Then came weekend, and I sat down and watched the movie. I was\u000aimmediately thrilled after first 30 minutes, and later on kept hoping\u000aIt'd never end. But once the end came, I sat there, eyes a bit wet, and\u000athought WOW. This truly was the best movie I've ever seen, beating\u000aeverything else in the IMDb list.Afterwards, I went and ordered the DVD (2 of 'em to cover my\u000aillegalness in the first place) and watched the extra contets as well.\u000aTruly a 1# of all time.I'm going to miss Morgan Freeman when he leaves this world.\u000a

V\u000aWhat have we become, if not a nation of lost beings? We seem to be\u000astarving from the ravages of unmet needs and relentless fear--\u000afestering deeply a growing malnutrition of the soul. Indeed, was there\u000aever a time when human beings truly lived to the full measure of their\u000acapacity for good? Every once in a while a story is so beautifully constructed that we\u000afind a penetrating transformation has overtaken us, defying\u000aexplanation, yet is as instinctively recognizable as joy, or laughter,\u000aor even deep sorrow. Such is the work of Writer/Director Frank Darabont\u000ain his powerful motion picture tale, "The Shawshank Redemption", which\u000ais based on a most unassuming parable by Stephen King.Only through redemption will our nation find its way; and it is only by\u000athe people, those individuals who refuse to compromise their capacity\u000ato create beauty--or better, recognize it--who will guide us to our\u000atrue potential as a society, or more fundamentally, as a planetary\u000aspecies. Indeed, beyond redemption is a lighted pathway to our intended destiny,\u000awhere fear transforms into compassion and hope becomes the new reality,\u000aever nourishing our spirit. Remember how you felt after watching this film? Though it may be true\u000athat we have never met, in many ways I know who you are. And with that\u000ainsight wells up a comfort so luminous it lights this pathway on which,\u000athrough all the mysteriousness of the vast universe, we both travel\u000aever onward and upward.Ellison Horne\u000a

V\u000aThis is an absolutely beautiful movie. I'm not so sure if it deserves\u000ato be the number one movie on IMDb, or how exactly it wound up there,\u000abut that aside I do really love it. You really feel for Andy and the rest of the prisoners in this movie.\u000aIt's a shame to see the warden and prison guards having the power that\u000athey do over the inmates, especially since they are crooked, foul\u000aindividuals.One great scene is that of Brooks after he is released. I can still\u000aremember the letter that he was narrating while it played out. Very\u000anicely done. There are many memorable lines throughout this movie, many\u000aof which deal with hope which is a nice thing to hear about. The finale when you find out that Andy had been tunneling out for\u000atwenty years was a very powerful one. It was amazing to think about how\u000ait was accomplished and how he never gave up hope.The story really drives this film and the script is terrific. The\u000aperformance and characters are top notch and this movie should\u000adefinitely be seen by anyone who is a fan of movies.\u000a

Now talking about the film making; Mr. Robbins\u000awas cool, very well act his role. I don't want to discuss why he didn't\u000aget Oscar, because his partner Mr. Freeman (who got the Oscar) was\u000adoing very well too. My dad does't like drama actually, but when he saw\u000athis movie, he was moved and stand still on his chair to watch this\u000aincredible movie. If you don't believe that this movie is awesome and\u000acan inspire you to change your life, why don't you just give it a shot\u000aby borrowing or buying that movie?great thanks i deliver to Stephen King and all people who are making\u000athe story possible for me to watch. i have been changed so much.Last, just recommended for all people who are holding hope!\u000a

V\u000aAndy is a innocent man, who is thrown into prison for a crime he did\u000anot commit, he finds himself having to survive and in turn begins a\u000alife long friendship with another inmate.This film is raw and intense, it doesn't hide the brutal honesty of\u000aprison life. I found myself at times cringing at certain scenes that\u000aare very hard to watch.Through this film I felt Andy's pain, his sadness, his fear and his\u000arage; his yearning to be a free man once again and then his happiness\u000aas he breaks away from the clutches of that evil place.The acting is top-notch, all the actors give great performances,\u000aespecially Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman whose narration gives the\u000aaudience something to hold onto. I found it quite sad, when Red is\u000areleased; a man who has spent his whole life behind bars and is unable\u000ato find any kind of belonging...until he finally decides to go after\u000ahis old friend.But for me, it is when Andy chisels away night after night and crawls\u000ahis way to freedom that brought tears to my eyes....As he screams out,\u000awhile the rain falls on him. It's one the greatest moments in cinema, I\u000abegan to breath once again; something I was unable to do throughout the\u000afilm. Simply mesmerising.\u000a

Almost all the time when I talk about movies, I strongly\u000arecommend The Shawshank Redemption.The roles of Andy Dufresne, Red, Brooks and several others are very\u000awell performed. This movie just have it all: excellent music, it's\u000afantastically written, good acting, etc.It's so hard to believe that this wonderful movie was not awarded\u000aneither at The Oscars nor The Golden Globes, but the best of all is\u000athat The IMDb voters have it at #1. It really deserves to be at the\u000atop.\u000a

V\u000awell...you normally don't find these types of movie all the time. In\u000aShawshank you can see Tim Robbins at his best when compared to other\u000amovies...goes hand in hand with the plot...nd totally suits the\u000aCharacter to be resembled in the movie.Well this must be the best of Morgan Freeman..and as the movie reaches\u000aits climax it makes one more curious. As the movie moves towards its\u000aending it thickens more involving one into it. Perfect plot , awesome\u000aDirection. The movie includes all it needs to show about prison life\u000alike violence and hopelessness of a life behind bars.Final ending is not at all predictable which forms a shocking\u000aclimax.The Shawshank Redemption is all about hope and, because of that,\u000awatching it is both uplifting, exciting and cathartic.This movie would\u000aalways stay on the Top in my List.\u000a

V\u000aWell I bought this film and thought it would be a boring film about a\u000aprison, but no I was seriously wrong it has to be one of the most\u000agreatest films I have ever seen, portraying the beauty of friendship so\u000astrong that the world could hang upon. I was engrossed by the film\u000aentirely from start to finish, with it's humours, it's sadness, it's\u000aaction. I was so wrong to buy with a half hearted feeling. I would\u000arecommend this film to anyone as the film they would most enjoy. My\u000afavourite part was right at the end where Red goes and finds the box\u000aand goes back to Andy and that scene on the beach was what got me; like\u000aa strike of lightning, so much I nearly cried. The part where Andy has\u000athe guts to go to a Hitler like man and talk to him about his finances\u000agoes to show that there are people in the world who can make the\u000asmallest difference but the biggest changes.\u000a

V\u000aOh dear oh dear oh dear, I guess I have just upset many people who do\u000anot want this movie keeping the top spot in IMDb's Top 250 movies but,\u000adespite my personal reservations regarding it's lofty position ahead of\u000amany other great movies, I really do rate this as a 10/10 movie and\u000ahave done for many years.Adapted from the novella by Stephen King I am sure that many people\u000awere surprised by just how good the movie turned out to be although the\u000asource material was great in it's own right (also featuring The Body,\u000awhich was filmed as Stand By Me, and Apt Pupil which deserves far more\u000aattention than it receives from film fans). Thankfully, that source\u000amaterial was treated with loving care and director Frank Darabont seems\u000ato have led a cast and crew that were all able to look after every\u000adetail so that the big picture was a thing of beauty.Tim Robbins stars as Andy Dufresne, a young man who faces a long, long\u000atime in prison after he is found guilty of murdering his wife and her\u000alover. While inside he learns an awful lot about what a man can hold\u000aonto and let himself be put through if there is still an ounce of hope\u000ain his soul.In the acting stakes we get some great turns from the likes of Morgan\u000aFreeman (playing "Red", the man who can get you anything and who\u000abecomes Andy's best friend inside those bleak, high walls), Bob Gunton\u000aas a rather "obtuse" warden, Clancy Brown as a particularly vicious\u000aguard and then there are William Sadler, Gil Bellows and James Whitmore\u000aall giving superb performances. And yet, despite the sheer quality on\u000ashow, Tim Robbins still manages to steal the movie. He IS Andy Dufresne\u000aand those who have read the original novella will know as soon as he\u000agets that enigmatic little smirk on his face that Robbins was the\u000aperfect choice for the role.Bottles of cool drink on a hot rooftop, a slowly building library\u000acollection, the moment of musical joy that sees Dufresne severely\u000apunished for his overstepping of the mark and many other scenes spring\u000ato mind as classic moments in a movie almost chock full of classic\u000amoments. Some people prefer The Green Mile but I ain't one of them.See this if you like: The Green Mile, The Escapist, Murder In The\u000aFirst.\u000a

V\u000aI feel this movie is a bit underrated/unappreciated, but it is truly\u000aone of my favorites of all time. Topnotch script, flawless acting. What\u000aa powerful story. Perfect casting. Maybe the most effective I've ever\u000aseen Morgan Freemen (and that's saying a lot). Parts of this movie were\u000aa bit difficult to watch, due to how brutally realistic the scenes\u000awhere. This gut-wrenching film always managed to provide a small\u000aglimmer of hope, in spite of seemingly unsurmountable odds. The hard\u000alessons learned and the viciousness of the warden and his imps stack up\u000aagainst the humble, meek and cleaver lead character, brilliantly played\u000aby Tim Robbins (his best work to date). I've lost count of just how\u000amany times I've seen this marvelous film, but each time I discover\u000asomething that I missed previously. One of the best endings in\u000acinematic history.\u000a

V\u000aThis movie not only had a very good story line, but also the way story\u000awas told to the audience was commendable. i have not seen many movies\u000awhich you want to watch again, but this sure was. After you watch the movie and know what Andy actually was upto, you\u000awould want to actually watch it again to see how good actors\u000a(especially Andy) acted in those scenes. Movie revolves around Andy who is a hot shot banker, convicted for his\u000awife's murder and subsequently sent for two life sentences back to back\u000ain Shawshank Prison. Andy who by his level of education and IQ gets\u000agifted with both friends and enemies inside the walls, gels up well\u000awith Red, who gets a lot of things done for Andy. Warden also is\u000aimpressed with Andy and starts a scam with his help to launder money\u000ainto his pocket. In between, the brawl with "gang of sisters" the homosexuals who try to\u000aassault Andy and Reds group, with who Andy starts to get along with\u000apretty well, play a very important part in the story.After twenty years, a young boy who somehow knows and could testify\u000aAndy's innocence comes to Shawshank Prison for committing some felony.\u000aWarden gets him killed and covers up the crime with 'that boy trying to\u000abreak free' story. By this time Andy gets ready for his revenge with Warden and his final\u000astep. Story unfolds.I would like everybody who watches this to watch this movie twice, so\u000athat they can understand the true essence of storytelling. Must tell\u000ayou that, I was more thrilled when I watched it for second time, as I\u000acould understand things which were puzzling me for the first time. Brilliantly told, Meticulously Acted and Highly Recommended.\u000a

Excellent characters throughout\u000athe movie and a most enjoyable watch. Also if you get the chance read\u000athe Stephen King story it was adapted from. You don't have to be a Stephen King fan to enjoy this movie so give it\u000aa try. Well I am trying to write something without giving a spoiler or\u000aputting in junk words but it seems IMDb insists I write at least 10\u000alines of text when just 3 or 4 lines would do.\u000a

V\u000aI Thought To Myself At First When I First viewed this movie it wasn't\u000aat all going to be any worser than most movies i've seen. But I was\u000awrong. It's the best adapted movie of all time and I think I ought say\u000ait's the best movie I've ever seen since The Dark Knight. I haven't\u000aseen The Godfather Francise Yet but don't really want to now that I've\u000aseen The Shawshank Redemption the very best movie and the top of my\u000afavorite movie lists. It's powerful and jaw-dropping and can get very\u000aemotional at times and the best thing about this film is Tim Robins the\u000abest actor of all time and Morgan Freeman clearly the main character of\u000athe film. The bad guys are the captain of the guards Mr Hatley I\u000aremember and Norton the Worton the biggest assholes I've seen in a\u000amovie that can drive you insane. And also Brookes and the guy with the\u000abeard around his cheeks can't remember his name they were good too.\u000aBest Movie of all time period 10/10\u000a

V\u000aA lesson of life. An extraordinary piece of film making that could\u000arelate to life itself.This is along with "The Godfather" the most influential movie of all\u000atime because it gives Hollywood a good name. I mean, it displays the\u000abest of it through memorable acting, marvelous direction, extraordinary\u000aart direction and cinematography, and best of all; it achieves to\u000adeliver a message that may sound a cliché but ends up being a vital\u000apart of life, you know it deals with "Hope". Sure, this is the anti\u000athesis of "The Godfather" in terms of the good characters always "win",\u000aor the positive message, but that's another story.The pace of the movie is perfect because it gives it's time to explain\u000athe events at it's full expression and through little details we fully\u000aget into the world of Shawshank and we get to know perfectly the\u000aprincipal inmates of it. Andy Dufrense is played brilliantly by Tim\u000aRobbins who deserved an Oscar nod for his display of intelligence,\u000adesperation, cold blood when needed and best of all, hope. But Morgan\u000aFreeman steals the show as a character came from Heaven. He truly\u000ainspires all the possible feelings to the audience. One of the all time\u000abest performances. Clancy Brown also delivers s fantastic performance\u000aas the creepy and cold blooded guardian. He's the man! The events of\u000athe movie will get the best of you if you give them the chance. You\u000awill feel happiness, hope, anger, sadness, and even you will have the\u000atime to reflex for some specific moments.Death is seen as a new way of watching things here. Through Brooks\u000ademise we learn that he was institutional, I mean, his life was prison.But as it's a big budget film, it has to deal with the obligatory\u000aHollywood situations such as the tender Jake sub-plot, the necessary\u000aviolent sequences, and the message it gives to the audience.I don't like poems that much but this movie is the closest thing to\u000afilm poetry. When art mixes correctly with talent and big resources\u000asuch as money, great things can happen and this beautiful movie is the\u000aprime example.Friendship is displayed as one of the most important things in the\u000aworld. But you will find more values such as redemption, justice,\u000atenderness, and being grateful. The ending always makes me wanna cry,\u000abut I play the strong guy ;)Please watch this movie in order to witness one of the best movies of\u000aall time, if not one of the top 3.\u000a

V\u000aThis is as close to a perfect film as I believe I have ever seen.\u000aEverything about it just WORKS. Stephen King famously sells his stories\u000ato filmmakers for one dollar, well this has got to be the best dollar\u000ahe has ever spent. Shawshank arrived with no fanfare, no big premiere,\u000ait just opened. When I first read the Stephen King story, I thought it\u000awould be one of the best King stories to be made into a film I could\u000aimagine, and Frank Darabont did not let me down.Casting Morgan Freeman was probably the biggest coup for this film, he\u000ais the absolute soul of dignity in everything he appears in, Tim\u000aRobbins, relatively unknown at the time of filming, is a revelation. It\u000ais, in fact, almost impossible to imagine any other actors in a single\u000arole in this film it is so perfectly cast. Then there is the music, so\u000awonderfully incidental and appropriate. I could go on and on about\u000aspecifics, photography, lighting, but it is probably best to say that\u000aanyone with a heart and a keen eye for good film-making should not miss\u000athis film. Every time I watch it I have a lump in my throat for nearly\u000athe entire running time, maybe because I have such a soft spot for it,\u000abut also because, when you know the story and it unfolds for you, every\u000atime you watch it different emotions come to the fore. There have been\u000acriticisms that Shawshank is nothing more than the most manipulative\u000aform of emotional heart-string tugging, but those criticisms are wrong,\u000awhenever Darabont was at risk of overdoing it with the manipulation, he\u000apulled back. There is a moment near the end when it would have been\u000aperfectly appropriate for Freeman's character to burst into tears (the\u000acharacter does in the story), but he does not. It is an immensely\u000aeffective moment, the expression on his face is so convincing that you\u000acannot help but be reduced to tears yourself. Whether it was the actors\u000adecision or the directors is as irrelevant as the many detractors of\u000athis beautifully realised masterpiece.\u000a

V\u000aIf there is a movie which defines "masterpiece" this will be it. It has\u000abeen a long time I saw a movie which really surprised me. You will\u000anever know what is about to come. And when it ends, you find the\u000aglimmering shine of hope. If this movie released any year other the\u000ayear of the Forrest Gump I am sure it would have swept the Academy\u000aAwards.I usually don't like watching a decade old movie, but since this movie,\u000ai have already gone through a dozen on the top 250 list. Morgan Freeman\u000ais great as usual. So is Tim Robbins and James Whitmore. The whole cast\u000abrings alive the spirit of the movie. And my suggestion to all who\u000ahaven't seen it already would be- add this to the top of your\u000ato-do-list.Fan of such Hope-giving and Inspiring films: Shashank\u000a

V\u000aThis was a great movie. What makes this movie so good is the irony that\u000ais used. Since the story was being told from Red's point of view, no\u000aone knew exactly all the things that Andy was doing to exscape. When\u000athe wardon came and checked his room, no one thought nothing of him\u000ahaving his bible. That's when the wardon said his favorite passage was\u000a"Salvation lies within". When he asked Red for a rock hammer, no one\u000areally expected for him to use it to exscape because it would take so\u000along. Then we asked for the poster, I figured he just needed something\u000ato make his time there more better. Once he actually came up missing. I\u000areally didn't know what to expect. When the wardon finds out how he got\u000aout, he left that favorite passage in the beginning showing that Andy's\u000asalvation really did lie within the bible. That's why i think the irony\u000ais very good and that is what really makes this a good movie.\u000a

The part that caught me by surprise is the night that he\u000aasked for the rope i swore that he was going to kill himself but it\u000aturns out that in the morning he had done the impossible. Morgan\u000aFreeman also played good as a narrator which made it seem as if he was\u000awhat the story was about which made Andy even more mysterious because\u000anot much is revealed about him.\u000a

V\u000aThe Shawshank Redemption makes me feel nostalgic about the time periods\u000ait is set in, even though I was born in the 1980s. That is how special\u000athis movie is.As well as nostalgia, it evokes in me a whole range of other emotions-\u000asorrow, happiness, horror, hope, anger and some that are hard to\u000adescribe with words.The performances are of the highest quality- every character is\u000aportrayed in such a way as to enhance the authenticity of the film and\u000agive it true life. The same can be said for the production values,\u000acostumes, props etc.The score by Thomas Newman enables full immersion into the world of\u000aShawshank, and allows the viewer to actually feel what the characters\u000aare feeling.I like the way the viewer is made to think that this is a true story,\u000aand that they may have come into contact with this world at some point\u000ain their life. An example "...Warden Norton instituted his famous\u000aInside-Out program. You may remember reading about it."The Shawshank Redemption is one of those rare movies that have a\u000aperfect ending, the definition of perfect being... well, here are a few\u000aaspects of the ending that make it perfect: 1) It allows catharsis 2)\u000aIt is extremely satisfying 3) It is not ruined by "Hollywood sugar\u000acoating"The Shawshank Redemption is a movie of rare greatness, to whose rank\u000abelong few other movies. A work of great beauty.\u000a

V\u000aSo, i watched this film thinking it'd be pretty good. Was i wrong. It\u000awasn't good, nor was it bad-it was perfect. It's hard to get a perfect\u000afilm but i think this is a film that if you don't watch before you die\u000ayour crazy. The story is an adaption of Stephen King's (when you hear\u000athat name you know it's going to be good) novel by the same name. It's\u000aabout a prisoner put in jail for life for the wrong crime. He makes\u000afriends, people die, life moves on through his hardship until the\u000achance to escape walks along. Overall 10/10, you could describe it with\u000aany word it'd still be awesome. Acting - Morgan Freeman was 10/10 in\u000athis, and through a lot of his movies. Tim Robbins made a character\u000athat was calm and cool and scared and worried etc. and could change\u000athrough his emotions in a heartbeat. 10/10I'll stop it there, but that's all you need to know. It deserves to be\u000atop and if you don't think so cast your opinions because until then\u000ait'll just keep being perfect.\u000a

V\u000aIt is a great movie which received 7 Academy award nominations but lost\u000ato eventual winner Forrest Gump and ranked 1# on IMDb.So there was\u000aenough curiosity to watch this one.It is a very intelligent film in terms of story telling.The director\u000adeserves kudos for extracting such fine performances from his lead\u000apair,Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman who received Academy award\u000anominations for their respective roles. Now the main question is does\u000ait deserve the top spot on IMDb.Well,the immediate answer is NO.The\u000aGodfather may be superior to The Shawshank Redemption by all means but\u000ait manages to hold its own and is complete as a film.Shawshank is a\u000atreat for the viewers.Do watch it for its gripping story well told.\u000a

V\u000aI have been an avid fan of Stephen King since elementary school. I went\u000ato a catholic school from kindergarten through 8th grade. Of all places\u000afor me to pick up my first King book, it was at a book fair for my\u000aschool. It was "The Eyes of the Dragon". I was hooked. I remember\u000areading this short story and not thinking much of it. Previous King\u000abooks-turned-movies offered a glimpse of what was to come. 90% of his\u000amovies are almost perfect transitions from print to screen. Green Mile\u000ais among the best as well, but......This movie definitely is what it is all about. I know it is cliché\u000ato say it, yet I feel there has never been a more appropriate\u000acomparison. This movie is like a fine wine. Not quite appreciated fully\u000aat first but as time passes, it is clearly head and shoulders above the\u000arest. It was released in a year that saw amazing film-making. Gump\u000atakes the best picture, and there were a handful of others which could\u000ahave taken that honor - had they been released any other year. Pulp\u000aFiction most notably... Don't get me wrong, Gump is a great movie just\u000anot even close to best that year. 3rd or lower.When I first joined IMDb, Shawshank was #2. I hoped one day it would\u000aovertake the top spot and it happened shortly after Dark Knight held it\u000afor a brief period of time. Here's to Andy & hope, it is a wonderful\u000athing!\u000a

V\u000aI have only seen about a dozen films in a cinema setting in my life and\u000athis film was one of the many that I originally watched on Video. I\u000awatched it for the first time about five years ago having not\u000apreviously heard of it before. I was swept away by the way the story\u000aunfolded and at the end I just felt as if my life had been uplifted by\u000ahaving watched it. Not in some life changing way but just being better\u000athan it was. I am not an idiot but I cannot adequately describe exactly\u000ahow this film affected me, maybe I don't need to. I have watched a lot\u000aof the films in the IMDb top 250 and numerous that are not in the list\u000aand this is one of very few which I would watch again and again. Im not\u000ainterested in the way it was made I just appreciate it for what it is.\u000aIt is a masterpiece in the same way that a piece of music or a painting\u000awould be regarded and in my humble opinion deserves to be at the top of\u000athe pile in the IMDb top 250. It probably wont sort your problems out\u000afor you but it should make you think about whats important in life. One\u000aof the few conclusions that I personally came to was that it shows that\u000athe expression 'what goes around comes around' is in the film for all\u000ato see. In a nutshell the good and bad that people do have a way of\u000acoming back eventually to reward or penalise. The main characters in\u000athe film were either rewarded or penalised and real life isn't always\u000athat organised or fair. Anyway everybody has an opinion and if there is\u000aanybody out there that hasn't seen this film please watch it you might\u000anot like it but it is almost certain you will be affected by this film.\u000a

V\u000aI'm glad that this and not "The Dark Knight" is considered the greatest\u000amovie of all time. TDK lost that battle if nothing else. And I love how\u000ayou literally just cant stop watching this film once it begins, despite\u000athe fact that it offers the viewer no challenge whatsoever. The\u000aartistry here is not in the tale itself, but in the telling of the\u000atale. Its a hope-in-the-face-of-tragedy fable, with a miraculous twist\u000athat turns the whole thing on its head. You are not meant to ask too\u000amany questions, else the whole thing falls apart.The key to this film is the editing and the photography. The filmmakers\u000ahave used the simplest possible visuals to frame the story. Two giants\u000ain the film profession lent their enormous talent to this production :\u000aeditor Richard Francis-Bruce & cinematographer Roger Deakins. About\u000a99.99 % of films rely on heavy-handed editing and camera gimmicks to\u000atell the story, and ironically they fail. In this film you just don't\u000aperceive the role of the editor or the cinematographer, despite their\u000acontinual presence. Watch how the narration, images and score are\u000awelded together in a flawless lock-step precision. There isn't a single\u000afalse moment or an out-of-place/unnecessary scene; the vignettes are\u000amasterfully assembled into a seamless whole.I'm afraid I cant give this film a 10/10 because it isn't better than\u000adozens of other films that I've seen. In this world, events occur as\u000athe story needs them, not as they might in the real world. This is done\u000aso extraordinarily well that a passive viewer will NOT notice the\u000atricks involved. And so it gives me almost nothing non-filmic to think\u000aabout. But watch this film for its narrative mastery.\u000a

V\u000aI was not born when this movie came out so I have just had the chance\u000ato watch this movie and actually appreciate it recently and I must say\u000aI can see why this movie is recognized as one of the best movies of all\u000atimes. The movie generally gets across human emotion and the acting and\u000adirecting of everyone involved makes this movie a brilliant show alone.\u000aNot only is the movie well made but the story of it is fantastic and\u000acertainly does not mess up Stephen Kings novel. Even in it's near 3\u000ahour runtime it does not ever get boring (and this is coming from\u000asomeone who comes from the add generation) and always has a story to\u000atell. Everything in this movie is important about the storytelling,\u000afrom the main story to even Brooks story of him spending 50 years in\u000aprison and then being released and realizing he is completely dependent\u000aon the prison and has become used to being enclosed in its walls.Overall, the film is a masterpiece and I am glad I got to watch such a\u000afantastic film. It is certainly up there in terms of the best movie of\u000aall time, and even though I am a little hesitant to call it the best, I\u000awould definitely put it in the top 10. I give this movie 96%.\u000a

V\u000aAt the time of this writing "The Shawshank Redemption" occupies the top\u000aspot in IMDb's list of top rated films. I will state right off the bat\u000athat I don't agree with that assessment but that doesn't mean that I\u000adon't think the film is a fine one.The story (based on a Stephen King novella) concerns a man sent to\u000aShawshank Penitentiary after being convicted of killing his wife and\u000aher lover. Once there he undergoes many hardships but eventually\u000abefriends the resident dealer in contraband and strikes an accord with\u000athe guards and warden. However, through it all he never loses the hope\u000athat someday, somehow he'll regain his freedom.The cast is commendable. Morgan Freeman delivered the film's best\u000aperformance and landed a well-deserved Oscar nomination in the process.\u000aTim Robbins was excellent as well, giving one of the best performances\u000aof his career. The remainder of the cast is filled out by an assortment\u000aof well-chosen character actors. Of these, Bob Gunton & James Whitmore\u000adeserve special praise.The film's production values don't disappoint either though they are\u000aundeniably not at quite the same level as the films that critics\u000ausually dub the best of all time. Frank Darabont's direction is\u000atasteful, though, and is bolstered by Oscar-nominated cinematography\u000acourtesy of eight time nominee Roger Deakins. Thomas Newman's\u000aOscar-nominated score has some memorable moments and provides solid\u000asupport throughout.In the end, though, while the film is indeed admirable from a technical\u000astandpoint, it is the emotional impact that has made it a favorite of\u000aso many. Naturally, emotional responses will vary from person to person\u000abut this film seems to hit the mark more than any other. Do yourself a\u000afavour and check it out.\u000a

V\u000aThis is a movie that does not try to outsmart its viewer. It's a simple\u000astory of friendship and "brotherhood", of good and evil. One of the\u000abiggest things I got from this film is patience and determination. The\u000away the lead character Andy Dufresne, put up with the "wrongs"\u000athroughout his life to finally be free. Traveling through 400 yards of\u000ash*t to taste freedom speaks volumes of his lifelong battle. I cannot begin to count the times I've seen this movie. "Shawshank" is\u000aone of those movies that when you stumble upon it while channel\u000asurfing, you have to watch it until the end. No matter how many times\u000aI've seen it, I still weep at the "Brooks was here" scene and at the\u000aending of the movie. Such a well cast movie, you grow a fondness for\u000athe characters good and bad. If I had to point out one flaw, it would be the "Elvis" prisoner.....\u000abut this is only a mere speck that cannot dull the shine of this\u000aoutstanding movie. This is a movie that should have swept the Oscars in 1995. Between the\u000awriting and the acting performances, It's a "no-brainer".\u000a

V\u000aI wondered what IMDb people voted as the best movie of all times until\u000aone day I entered the video store and rented this disc called Shawshank\u000aRedemption.I had the weird feeling that I already watched this movie before but\u000asplintered into different movies/TV series like humph the heroes and\u000athe villains, the acting all seemed so weird, is this deja vu? I am a\u000ayoung person so I didn't know how great this was until I went to the\u000avideo store Morgan Freeman is so good, the way he narrated his story\u000atouched my hypothalamus- he wasn't crappy nor unconvincing or sounded\u000aunderpaid nor overpaid-but-underqualified. He's great in what he do,\u000aacting.The story's gradual exposure of Andy Dufresne's vulnerability was good\u000aand not the hurried type most story makers do to make the character\u000abig. He was mysterious and cool.Great great great!!! I don't know but this inspired me in some way.\u000aWeird again right?\u000a

V\u000aThe Shawshank Redemption is arguably the finest work from Morgan\u000aFreeman, and up-holds as one of my favourite "prison" movies. A movie\u000athat walked out with zero Oscars in the 1994 Academy Awards and to earn\u000ait's place on top of the two-fifty, it's very impressive. They're some\u000avery memorable quotes, characters, stages and scenes in this movie\u000athat'll never be forgotten. It shows the value of friend-ship, a\u000aaccurate display of what prison is like and very good acting. The\u000athought of The Shawshank Redemption not winning an Oscar for its\u000aacting, writing or whatever is way beyond me. The Shawshank Redemption\u000ain my eyes is no solid masterpiece, but the hate and bash it gets feels\u000atotally unacceptable. A very solid movie with a suitable duration and\u000asome powerfully moving emotional scenes. One for everyone to see.\u000a

V\u000aThere aren't words too describe the greatness of this movie. The\u000aDirecting is fantastic. The music, moving. The dialog, amazing. The\u000astory, exhilarating. Stephen Kings fantastic story of hope has been\u000abrought to the screen as my second favored movie of all time.Andy Dufresene (Tim Robbins) is a middle aged man who has been wrongly\u000asent to prison for the murder of his wife and her lover. With a\u000alifetime to spend in Shawshank state prison he makes friends with an\u000aold timer at Shawshank, Ellis Boyd Redding(Morgan Freenman). Sfter a\u000acouple of years of abuse at the hands of the sisters (led by Mark\u000aRolston) Andy makes nice with the guards and becomes the teachers pet\u000aof the prison. During his time at Shawshank Andy endures more hell than\u000aanyone could ever imagine. From a friend dying to 50 feet of\u000aunimaginable stench.This movie was not as well received as it should have been. It may have\u000abeen nominated for a couple of Oscars but the viewer reception was just\u000anot to great. This movie is my favored only behind A Few Good Men.\u000a

V\u000aAn inspiring and simple drama that will move you with shocking moments\u000aand by the end, awe-inspiring sentiment.Our man gets sent to prison, though we're never quite sure if he done\u000ait or not. He meets Morgan Freeman and begins an unforgettable\u000afriendship, goes through trying experiences, and learns many things.In the end, we have an amazing film that will leave you with a sense of\u000aawe and inspiration, helping you with the trials of your own life.IMO, it's not the greatest film ever, definitely not deserving the top\u000aspot here on IMDb, but it's still a wonderful film and I recommend it\u000ahighly.And though it didn't win the Oscar for Best Picture-that went to Forest\u000aGump, and it was also up against Quiz Show, it is still a film that\u000awill always be remembered and cherished.Very, very good.\u000a

V\u000aI have seen numerous movies in my life, yet I return to this one time\u000aand time again because of the message it caries. The plot is generic\u000ayet the acting of Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman create an authentic\u000aand realistic setting. Morgan Freeman's voice narrates this emotional\u000amasterpiece, the tone of his low voice remains constant like the time\u000ain our lives. This movie shows just that, that times keeps flowing on\u000aby, you may hit some walls here and there yet you must make the best of\u000ait. Andy(Robbins) through various actions attracts many admirers at\u000aShawshank even those unpleasant. Through these friends he finds solace.\u000aIf you are into GREAT movies this is the ultimate, after this movie I\u000aknew that I would never see a better movie thereafter, and that\u000aconclusion has stood the test of time.\u000a

V\u000aThe story that emerges from from this unlikely source is hope and\u000ainspiration. I say unlikely source because the story comes from the pen\u000aof horror master Stephen King. This is not a story you can easily\u000aenvision coming from his tortured soul. But perhaps King is in his\u000aelement when words like prison, solitary confinement, torture and\u000aunrealistic all spring forth to describe the story of Andy Dufresne and\u000ahis years at Shawshank prison.Narrated by "Red" Redding (Morgan Freeman), Shawshank Prison has become\u000ahis captive home of customers since he is able to procure certain items\u000alike cigarettes, candy and so on. For a self proclaimed innocent victim\u000aof the system, new comer Andy Dufresne (Tim Robbins) "Red" is asked for\u000aa most unusual item - a rock pick. Andy is an amateur geologist. Andy\u000aand "Red" gradually become friends as people come and go, one way or\u000aanother, from Shawshank as time passes them by.What on the surface might seem like a depressing story and situation is\u000afilled with personal challenges and one's will to overcome impossible\u000aodds. The prison is speckled with interesting characters such as the\u000aoldest convict Brooks the librarian (James Whitmore) or the bible\u000athumping man at the top of Shawshank, Warden Norton (Bob Gunton).\u000aWhether doing time like Andy or finally being release like Brooks or\u000abeing torn between beliefs like Warden Norton, each man faces their own\u000achallenges while all of them endure the ravages of time.Everything about this movie is done with the backdrop of the prison\u000aeven though it is nothing like any typical prison film. The movie is\u000abased on Rita Hayworth and the Shawshank Redemption by Stephen King.\u000aThere is no horror that is normally found in King's work. Instead this\u000ais more of an inner character struggle like is found in another of\u000aKing's work, Stand By Me. Like that story the two main character are\u000alinked in partnership with Tim Robbins giving a moving and powerful\u000aperformance next to a solid character study by Morgan Freeman.Director Frank Darabont delivers a solid film adding lots of life to\u000awhat could have been a dreary background. The story flows evenly with a\u000agenuine care given to each character and each actor's performance.\u000aShawshank is an instant classic and puts Robbins in the lead to play\u000aany every-man role aside the likes of Jimmy Stewart.\u000a

V\u000aAdapted from a Stephen King novella, The Shawshank Redemption takes a\u000aprison drama and twists it into a fascinating existential treatise on\u000ahow to approach the business of day-to-day life in the face of a\u000adesperately Sisyphian reality. As the film's signature line suggests,\u000a"Get busy livin' or get busy dyin'." Filmed on location in an Ohio\u000aprison, the film occasionally lapses into familiar formulas and\u000awell-known stereotypes of the prison-drama genre, but overcomes them\u000adue in no small part to a pair of transcendent performances by Morgan\u000aFreeman and Tim Robbins. Director Frank Darabont and cinematographer\u000aRoger Deakins (a Coen brothers collaborator) recreate the drudgery and\u000ahopelessness of prison life in both the look and the details of dreary\u000arituals of daily life. Spanning twenty years in the lives of its\u000aprotagonists, Darabont's screenplay and direction allow us the luxury\u000aof getting to know these men -- hardened criminals, with little hope\u000afor the future -- through a series of quietly captivating scenes that\u000aslowly build atmosphere and tension without sacrificing\u000acharacterization and thematic integrity. A critical success but a box\u000aoffice failure when it was first released, the film was nominated for\u000aseven Oscars, but won nary a one. Only when Shawshank was released on\u000avideo did it steadily garner full-fledged public reverence.\u000a

V\u000aI just saw this movie on HBO for the 4th time, and I was shocked at how\u000amoving it was on this advanced viewing. Shawshank strikes a resonance\u000athat is hard to define, but is none the less evident to anyone who has\u000athe privilege of watching this movie.Since pretty much every major plot and acting observation has been made\u000ain previous analysis, I would like to take a stab at what is at the\u000aheart of this movie's greatness: The American Dream. This movie is all\u000aabout earning freedom, and even though the "redemption" is all about\u000adefying the judicial system, the movie is, in essence, an ode to\u000aAmerican freedom. Andy's character spends the movie trying to overcome\u000athe adversity of his surroundings to cultivate an individualistic\u000acharacter that cannot be corrupted by the oppressions of the warden,\u000anor the limitations. Rather, Andy's character strives with relentless\u000ahunger for the freedom, independence, and spirit that is at the heart\u000aof Americana.Therein lies the beauty of this movie. There are no obtuse plot twists.\u000aThere is no melodrama. Rather, this is the simple story of the American\u000adream, pure and simple. For anyone who was searching, this is the great\u000aAmerican movie.\u000a

Robbin's performance is impeccable and Freeman's acting\u000acan not be described unless it is flawless. what more can be said? you\u000abasically are a joke if this movie doesn't rank in your top 5. You must\u000asee this movie...if not don't rank any others!\u000a

V\u000aShawshank redemption is a film that change your view of point for your\u000aown life. When I watched the film first time around ten years ago, I\u000adiscovered something missing about my life that I do not know the real\u000ameaning of decision and grand. Duffrense made me someone that believe\u000ain myself firstly,and after Mr. Red again kept me believe in there is a\u000areal friendship and society in the world still even than much more we d\u000ameet and think or may be hope in our life from day to day. We just do\u000anot know that where/when we could meet it. May be that s why I always\u000awatch that movie when I lose my determinateness and confidence and each\u000atime Shawshank makes me recovered and feel better and stronger.As for the Tim Robbins s performance, sure that he corresponded\u000asignificantly AndyDuffresne over the expectations. Created a sensitive\u000abut extremelyintelligent prisoner at variance we have seen until today.\u000aHe was a simple someone. Assailed, belittled, used and hammered. He was\u000anot a classical hero-prisoner as we get used to, more caring and\u000ahumane. And Tim Robbins fitted the role by his appearance, acting\u000aability and style.I am not going to make a comment for Morgan Freeman. He is the topper\u000aof every comment I think.I love and appreciate him.Anyway, It is Shawshank Redemption. I do like the movies I think as\u000amuch as everyone who knows about life and fight to live.\u000a

V\u000aThe storyline of the "Shawshank Redemption" is great from the start.\u000aNarrated by Morgan Freeman, The movie starts off with the main\u000acharacter, Andy, being sentenced to life in prison for the murder of\u000ahis wife and her lover. But just like everyone else in jail, Andy is\u000a"innocent." Andy's main argument for the situation was that he was\u000adrunk and did not remember. He said that he thought of trying to scare\u000athem and later on, threw the gun into the lake. When Andy arrives to\u000athe prison, everyone is walked down the entrance way into Shawshank\u000aprison while the character Red (Morgan Freeman), the "go-to guy", makes\u000aa bet that Andy will be the first person to "crack" or "go insane" and\u000aburst into tears. Red and his friends of convicts all bet cigarettes on\u000adifferent inmates to see which will be the first one to crack.\u000aShockingly, Red loses the bet as Andy remains emotionless and lifeless\u000aas he walks through the walls of Shawshank. But as Red continues to\u000aobserve Andy's behavior, he soon realizes that Andy is more unique than\u000ahe seems. As Red's observation continues, he notices that Andy starts\u000atreating prison like life outside of the walls. Andy approaches Red and\u000aasks him for a "Rock Hammer" which is basically like a shrunken mining\u000apick. Andy continues to sculpt rocks and make chess pieces for his own\u000aamusement.When the cells close and the lights go off, if an inmate becomes rowdy,\u000athe guards give them an "Accident" eventually leading to the inmates\u000adeath. Andy almost experiences an "Accident" when he stops working and\u000ainterrupts a guard's conversation. Andy helps him with his situation in\u000aexchange for the workers have a day off and drink beer, and thus, he\u000abecomes in favor of the guards and the inmates. Andy soon finds himself\u000ain favor of the Warden as he starts doing everyone's taxes. When Andy\u000ais abused and beaten by the gang/group of inmates called, "The\u000aSisters," the guards stand in Andy's favor where they get the lead\u000asister have an "accident." Andy does what he can to help the prison\u000abecome a more comfortable environment where he builds a fancy library\u000aand retrieves a larger budget for "new" used books. Andy does what he\u000acan in the favor of the inmates and earns a high respect. In this\u000adramatic/suspenseful movie, hope is the main theme of the movie. Red\u000atells Andy, "Hope can kill a man." Andy replies, "No, Hope give a man a\u000areason to live, hope can set you free." I give this movie a 10/10\u000abecause it is simply a great film, the cinematography is awesome, the\u000asymbolism in lighting is great, and the storyline is a great one. I\u000awould recommend watching this movie.\u000a

V\u000aWell. I don't have anything to say but, the movie was 100% great.\u000aMorgan Freeman is the man. Superb acting & great story with everyone in\u000athe family can watch this movie together. Anyone haven't watched this\u000aclassic movie, please watch it. It's worth it buying the original DVD\u000afrom Amazon or CD Universe. The script is greatly done. Movies like\u000athis are more offently released. I watched it twice & I have the\u000aoriginal DVD with me. Talking about "Stephen King" great writer & I\u000aloved his films such as "Secret Window", "Red Rose", "The Mist", "Pet\u000aSemetary" are some of the movies I really preferred watching. The good\u000athing is that this movie are released by all the good production\u000acompanies like Castelock Entertainment, Warner Brothers & 20th Century\u000aFox.That's all. Again great movie. Watch it!!!\u000a

V\u000aFew movies can get this critic watching them again and again, but\u000aShawshank hits the mark on it's near flawless story and cinematography.\u000aWith the brilliant acting of Morgan Freeman and as Red and Tim Robbins\u000aas Andy Dufresne, this adaptation of a Stephen King novella reaches out\u000ato audiences of all backgrounds.Comedy lovers need not be discouraged as The Shawshank Redemption is\u000awithout comic relief to lighten the dramatic tensions laced within the\u000amovie.My one criticism though is that write/director Frank Darabont just had\u000ato yank that extra tear out of the audience. This was apparent in\u000acertain scenes as the one when Brooks Hatlen has too much "trouble"\u000awith his free life.\u000a

V\u000aThis film is probably one of if not the best sleeper hits in film\u000ahistory. Of all the votes cast on IMDb, I bet less than 1% saw the film\u000aat the cinema. Like all sleeper hits, under-hyped at the time of\u000arelease, when you watch it and revel in its brilliance, your hair\u000astanding on end in parts, it feels more personal to you than a massive\u000ablockbuster. I think this is why it is so over-rated. it is not a ten.\u000aTim Robbins and Morgan Freeman are so fantastic and the story is so\u000aemotionally wrought that it is possible to get carried away. But better\u000athan the Godfather? Gimme a break!!! We are comparing the work of a\u000asuperb craftsman with the work of a visionary artist whose films have\u000ahad more influence on modern cinema than anyone bar perhaps his old\u000afilm-school mates. A fantastic, hugely-credible tearjerker. By the DVD,\u000aget it out now and again, get yer tissues ready.\u000a

V\u000aFilm Review: The Shawshank Redemption (from a novel by Stephen King)\u000aThe tale of the banker (Tim Robbins), who, given life imprisonment for\u000athe murder of his wife and her lover, adapts to prison life using his\u000anative wit, as told through the eyes of another lifer (Morgan Freeman).\u000aAbsorbing plot, interesting relationship between the two leads. The\u000aprison system (of Maine) exposed as brutal and corrupt, the chief guard\u000a(sadist) and the warden (sanctimonious bible basher) are particularly\u000anasty. Setting the story between the 40s and 60s makes it a little\u000aeasier to believe. Fairytale ending.Conservatives might argue all the brutality is justified in making\u000aprison a deterrent, but that hardly excuses the murders by guards and\u000aembezzlement by the warden. Of course the same people will contend\u000ainsider trading keeps the stock market efficient  laws are OK as long\u000aas they do not inconvenience entrepreneurs. What we see here is a\u000acriminal injustice system similar to that which prevailed in parts of\u000aAustralia at the time (and probably still does). The public doesn't\u000acare and the politicians don't want to appear soft on crime, after all,\u000aonly bad people go to prison. Actually, King accepts that some\u000aprisoners have done pretty awful things, and go on doing them in\u000aprison.So who is being redeemed? The problem is that Tim Robbin's character is\u000aa moral and upright character who should not be in jail  he has no\u000aneed to forgive himself. Most of the other prisoners seem to think they\u000aare innocent, which makes "redemption" hard for them. Perhaps Morgan\u000aFreeman's character eventually does, but at enormous cost. Anyway, it's\u000aa good yarn, and virtue (of a sort) does triumph, which is always\u000acheering.\u000a

V\u000aThe summary must sound cliché, but this truly provides as a sleeping\u000agiant of a spectacle. Originally shown to my class at school, we tried\u000ato postpone this movie by nagging the teacher and ended up watching a\u000amovie we started only for slight show. We saw 'The Crow (1994)' and\u000areally didn't care much for this film. However, from the opening scene\u000ato the closing of the picture, The Shawshank Redemption captured us all\u000aand never let our attention away. I had to watch this a few more times\u000awith friends and relatives out of school especially with some\u000adisruptive kids talking and what-not, but I still couldn't take my mind\u000aoff the fact that I underestimated this film so much.If you want someone to watch this movie, then don't make it seem so\u000agreat. It will take away from watching it by driving the expectations\u000aof that person far too high. Possibly the reason this isn't a perfect\u000aten for everyone. Others didn't want to see this movie high in rating\u000aor are too pompous to score it high or are just too dense to change the\u000arating from '1' to the actual rating deserved accordingly.This movie has a quirky name that sounds almost biblical and cast and\u000aeven Frank Darabont knew this could cause a problem. However, for\u000awhoever watches it, the quirky name throws him or her off guard and\u000athen pulls him or her into the movie unlike ever possible. This isn't a\u000ablockbuster; this is a magnificent film with an outstanding script and\u000aincredible and unusual cast. I'm writing this assuming everyone who has\u000aread this saw the movie already, and if you haven't... "it's alright".\u000a

V\u000aThis movie is a classic, first of its kind as far as prison breaking\u000aidea is concerned, the will of a man to help the prison, the grudge of\u000aa man against a corrupt officer and lastly the friendship that starts\u000awith two phrases of conversation that lasts forever.The whole plot revolves around Andy Dufresne who is a prisoner at the\u000aShawshank prison for a crime he hasn't done. He makes friendship with\u000aRed, an inmate, who has been prisoned for 20 years and the only person\u000awho can get you almost anything from outside world.Andy, a banker by profession, helps the prison guards to evade Income\u000aTax for free and only demands beer for his fellow inmates thus winning\u000athe hearts of his friends, who are ready to do anything for him. Later,\u000ahe switches his attention to the prison library and totally\u000arevolutionizes it by buying good books, music platters, a gramophone,\u000athus making it the best library in the state. He, then switches his\u000aattention to Tommy, an illiterate, who has the zest to study and come\u000aup in life. He teaches him from A,B,C to everything required for a\u000aperson to clear the metric exam. He also works for the Warden, a\u000acorrupt person who can do almost anything for money.Andy is a person who likes to keep himself busy, and at day he does all\u000athe above things to fulfill it. But, at night when he is idle, he\u000adrills a huge hole using a rock hammer and shades it with posters of\u000abeautiful women and cases the hammer within the bible given to him.It so happens that Tommy becomes a witness of Andy for not killing his\u000awife and his wife's lover, but the Warden, kills Tommy just because\u000areleasing Andy would stop all the monetary inflow into Shawshank.After he escapes the prison after 20 years of digging, he unfolds the\u000acorrupt warden's crimes to the press and escapes to Mexico without\u000aleaving a trail. The Warden, out of embarrassment and fear of being\u000alegally sued commits suicide which becomes a major factor for the\u000arelease of Red a few months later.Red follows the instructions given by Andy and both later meet in\u000aMexico.\u000a

V\u000aNormally I am very lazy at writing comments, but this film has made me\u000ado it. The film is marvelous and beautiful. At, First I thought It was\u000ajust another escape from the jail movie. But how the two and a half\u000ahour movie passed I didn't even come to know. I usually Fast Forward\u000asome scenes which I feel are regular but While watching this film I was\u000aso very mesmerized that I didn't even come to know how the time went\u000aby.The character Mr. Morgan plays is really the best and worth for an\u000aOscar. In fact all the characters were very good. One of the best about\u000athis movie is that there is only one female character and no sex scenes\u000aor any useless scenes which may be forcefully fitted in the movie.All I could say is that this is a must watch movie.Thats all folks\u000a

V\u000aI first saw this film some years ago and it left a deep impression on\u000amy mind. Recently I made a list of films that I had seen before that I\u000awould like to see again. Top of my list was The Shawshank Redemption.\u000aAll I could remember of the film was that it was about 2 men in Prison\u000aBUT that it had made a deep impression on me and I wanted to see it\u000aagain. I got to see it again and I was not disappointed. It was on\u000alocal TV and even all the ads couldn't spoil it. I was entranced by the\u000atwo chief characters who were superb and also by the secondary\u000acharacters. As the final credits rolled I felt as though I could watch\u000ait again and pick up on things that I had missed. I've never felt like\u000athat before about any film. I haven't checked as to whether this movie\u000areceived any Oscars but it certainly should have for the characters,\u000afor the story, for best film and so on. I highly recommend this movie.\u000aDefinitely 10/10. I'm off to find it on DVD.\u000a

V\u000aI must say that movies like this are certainly rare. There aren't many\u000aother movies that can combine drama and comedy and also a moral lesson\u000athat speaks to the heart as this one does. I actually watched this\u000amovie in my high school AP English 4 class as we were comparing it to\u000athe novel One Day in the Life of Ivan Denisovich by Alexandr\u000aSolzhenitsyn. While that was a good book, Shawshank is SO much better.\u000aI was surprised that our teacher actually let us watch it because our\u000aschool was somewhat anal about movies with sex and/or language in it\u000abut I am so glad i got to see it. It was the highlight of the class.\u000aThe main character of Andy has a quality that all of us possess, which\u000ais the desire to defy the odds overcome our obstacles. There's not much\u000amore I can say that has not already been said. Wonderful movie with\u000agreat acting and a lesson that is important for everyone 9 stars!\u000a

V\u000aShawshank Redemption is great picture. (My remark) is also an annoying\u000acliché. I am not the first person to daydream and then write why this\u000ais the best-loved movie either.The top movies are: a) War dramas/ b) Wild West masterpieces/ c) Pop\u000aCulture. The latter category is populated especially by Mafia movies,\u000astories about capable people hidden from the eyes that govern most\u000apeople's lives. Movies about the most successful of us that live their\u000aown way. In other words, Cool films.Alright, so what is "Shawshank" doing among these? My take is that\u000aShawshank touches a key in every one of us, and that key sounds as a\u000adescription of freedom. It has no subtle, hidden messages. It's not\u000acool. It's plain, straightforward. It has -though, this subject that\u000amay be the most sought right in the history of man. We always say after\u000awe pass a bleak period of our lives that it's good to know a deeply low\u000aand depressing moment since you know it cannot be worse. Well, that's\u000athe feeling I get about Shawshank's resonance.In some sense, I find a comparison basis with The Beatles. Why were the\u000alatter the best ever music group? Well, because they were so simple yet\u000aso effective. Does music or film has to have a deep hidden message?\u000aMusic and film must impress, first and foremost. Why we are most of the\u000atime preoccupied of making a difference from other people through our\u000apreferences, separating ourselves by fake elitist values, instead of\u000acreating something our own (in some sense "our own, together"), making\u000aus known through our very names. But I digress and I apologize for\u000amaybe wasting your time.The bottom line is not that Shawshank is the best, but that it is a\u000afavorite, a loved picture, like many others. Don't we have to give a\u000aten to oh-so-many others without being able to give it more. Likewise\u000ait impresses us that at the end credits we just keep silent just to not\u000abe clichéd. At least we come here and write reviews...\u000a

V\u000aAfter several viewings of The Shawshank Redemption, the idea of time\u000aand pressure is the thing that jumps out more than anything else,\u000aperhaps because the world we live in is geared towards short term\u000agains, quick fixes and schemes to achieve success without the requisite\u000aeffort.What I enjoyed most about this film is that it reminded me that lasting\u000aachievements are about consistency and persistent efforts over time and\u000athat this really is the only way, and to stay focused and positive in\u000athe face of the set backs life can throw at you. It has had the impact\u000aof making me see the mountains in my own life as a series of many small\u000asteps, even though this idea is essentially a background in the film,\u000awhich is really about the relationship between Andy and Red.The corrupt officials in the film are surprised by the turn of events,\u000ahighlighting them as short term thinkers, concerned with power and\u000aposition, unable to perceive the outcome of longer term thinking, so\u000awhen change comes, they are unprepared and the things that formerly\u000agave them security and certainty are the source of their own demise.\u000a

V\u000aTim Robbins (War of the worlds) stars as Andy, a man who is sentenced\u000ato life in Shawshank prison after the murder of his wife and her lover.In this adaptation of Stephen King's novel, director Darabont delivers\u000aa touching tale about one man's quest to live and to survive in one of\u000athe toughest prison's in the country, with great acting, a wonderful\u000aplot, and a few other little tweaks to make a beautiful crime drama.Nominated for 7 Oscars including Best Picture, Shawshank is a true\u000atouching crime drama, built around Andy Dufresne, who's approach to\u000alife in prison, his attitude towards life and the care for his inmates,\u000amakes him the most caring guy in prison you will ever see, which is\u000ahelped along by a stunning performance by Robbins. He is the symbol of\u000ahope, the guy of light and talent to aspire to.The ideology of hope is issued throughout the 2 hour film, and will\u000aleave you feeling inspired come the end.Robbins is helped along by Oscar nominated Morgan Freeman (Million\u000aDollar baby) who plays Red, the man who can get things. Red to, is a\u000asymbol of hope and light out of the darkness of the cruel surroundings,\u000aand his narration really gets an idea of what life in Shawshank is\u000areally like.Red's tale is very sharp, and very dramatic, giving a thoughtful\u000aapproach to prison life. The settings of the prison are very drab, a\u000avery dull place to serve your life sentence. The ruling of the place is\u000aequally as dramatic as the settings with cruel beatings, a place called\u000athe hole and fellow criminals to make life a misery. These approaches\u000ato running the prison is also controversial, a shocking portrayal of\u000athe system but justifies the genre exceptionally well.Having never read the novel, this film has inspired me to take an\u000ainterest in Stephen King's novels, as did Misery and The Shining, but\u000abeing a fan of drama rather than horror, makes this top of my list.Not the best of King's films I have to say, with The Shining and Misery\u000atrue film greats, but the touching tale of one man and his punishment\u000amakes Shawshank Redemption a remarkable stunning watch.\u000a

V\u000aTo most this is jail break movie, to others it's about friendship, yet\u000asome swear by how it is about standing up against authority.See, the thing with great movies is that they're always about simple\u000athings. This movie was about life - about the mistakes you make - about\u000athe price you might have to pay - about the irony in it - and of\u000acourse, about redemption. There is not a single moment in the movie\u000awhen you feel the crew has lost their grip on the script.What I enjoyed the most was Morgan Freeman's soliloquies. The dialogues\u000aa quoteworthy and are etched long after the movie ends.This is one of those movies you never get tired of watching.\u000a

V\u000aWith the many other entries already here, I won't bore the reader with\u000aanother synopsis. But hopefully, I will provide the details of one\u000ascene that sticks out so greatly in my memory because of the\u000aunbelievable (and fantastic) attention to detail that is not only here\u000abut is gloriously throughout this whole movie.Towards the end, Red (Morgan Freeman) is searching for something that\u000aAndy Dufresne (Tim Robbins) left for him. Red has been paroled but the\u000apossibility still exists that he will either kill himself like Brooks\u000aor commit a crime just to get back into the safety of prison. His day\u000ajob (bag boy at a local grocery store) is going nowhere.Months (possibly years) before, Andy gave Red directions on finding\u000asomething very important if Red ever got out of prison. Red finally\u000awith nothing else left to do, follows up on that request. He travels a\u000afairly long way (for him), across some difficult terrain and comes upon\u000athe scene described. Yet, it still requires searching and faith to\u000auncover what Andy has left him.Finally, he finds it, and opens the contents, and his life is changed\u000aforever.What is so important is the minute detail of this scene  the location\u000ais not next to some superhighway but far off the most unbeaten path one\u000acould imagine. The object is not carelessly left under one rock, but\u000aunder a number. Many people would have assumed they were in the wrong\u000aplace after a few minutes of not finding the object and moved on.Finally, when Red does find it, he looks very furtively around him sure\u000athat someone must be watching him. He sits down, now practically hidden\u000afrom any possible passers-by, and opens the object, and what he finds\u000ainside leads him to even more frightenedly glance around, sure now that\u000athere must be others watching, he must be found out, HE MUST STILL BE\u000aIN PRISON.This whole scene could have been done it about two minutes, a couple of\u000aquick cuts, him opening the box and discovering the contents and then a\u000acut to the next scene. But, it isn't that at all, it is one of the most\u000aintricate scenes I have ever witnessed for what is a small advancement\u000aof the plot. But that's the catch. This is so important to the plot,\u000athat the scene had to be given this kind of detail, so that the viewer\u000awould completely understand what Andy was talking about and what Red\u000ahad to discover. Red for all practical purposes was still in prison \u000aand he wasn't living yet, he was still getting busy dying.At this moment in the movie, Red (and you the viewer) still doesn't\u000aknow if Andy made it on the outside. He escaped, but where to? Yes\u000athere was that (more or less) cryptic postcard, but especially how did\u000awhatever Andy left for Red figure into the story? When would Andy have\u000aburied it? How did he know what to put inside it? Considering the\u000asearch underway for Andy on the day following his escape, if I were\u000aAndy, as soon as I recovered the money from the banks, I would have\u000abeen long gone, far, far out of the state of Maine. I certainly\u000awouldn't want the warden walking into any of the banks and finding me\u000athere, and it would have taken several days for the newspaper to decide\u000ato publish the article and especially for the State Corrections\u000aofficials to come down on the warden even with all the incriminating\u000aevidence. Andy needed to be gone for several months until all the\u000ahoopla had died down before he could return to actually bury the\u000aobject. So, the intricacy of this scene now becomes clear as it really\u000ahas to match the intricacy of Andy's planning for every detail This\u000awhole sequence is so important to the story, because it's now time for\u000aRed to decide if he should get busy dying or get busy living, because\u000ahe now finally has the choice. Maybe this movie is more about Red's\u000agrowth then about Andy's resilience. Andy always had his drive, Red\u000aneeded to learn it. Andy gave him the courage to finally face his own\u000ademons and overcome them. Red now has his chance at redemption.\u000aRemember, Andy didn't commit any crimes, Red did. Andy really didn't\u000aneed to be redeemed - Red needed it badly, The performances by Tim\u000aRobbins, especially when he tells Red of his request and Red imagines\u000athe worst, and of Morgan Freeman in this little scene are spectacular.\u000aI cannot possibly imagine any other actors pulling this off.\u000a

V\u000aThe Shawshank Redemption is a unique movie.Tim Robbins gives the performance of his life and this is the movie for\u000awhich Morgan Freeman deserved to win an Oscar but didn't. There are many twists and turns and the ending is very poignant.In fact, the entire last third of movie is filled with marvelous\u000ascenes. If there is any drawback to this movie, it is that it is a tad too\u000along, meaning it's often edited when it is shown with commercials on\u000aTV. Rent this, or better yet, buy it to enjoy it fully.\u000a

V\u000aThe Shawshank Redemption is a great movie. You can tell it is a great\u000amovie from the very beginning. Unlike many movies of the same type, the\u000amain character gets away, and the main villain gets what was coming too\u000ahim. The Scene where Andy escapes is one of those scenes that will\u000astick with you for a long time. It is without a doubt one of my\u000afavorite movie scenes. The way he is just stripping his clothes and\u000athrowing them on the ground, it really gives you a since for how\u000aemotional a moment it is for him. When he looks up at the sky, it just\u000amakes you want to cry. Hey that rhymed. Anyway, everyone should see\u000athis movie.\u000a

V\u000aThis film captivates the imagination and gives all who watch it hope.\u000aFor a film to put you to tears through happiness and sadness it really\u000ahas to be something special. It has one of the greatest twists ever in\u000afilm and has an ending that is unrivalled, it could not have been made\u000aany better. I have watched it maybe twenty times, its always an\u000ainspiration and an excellent tonic for those of us living a life we\u000awould like to change.The lines and the narration at the end are like poetry and the message\u000aof hope and human defiance is transcended to all. I can't recommend\u000athis film highly enough, it is an emotional roller-coaster but truly\u000amagical and will leave you warm inside.A masterpiece.\u000a

V\u000aWhen I first got this movie I was never bothered to watch it. I first\u000aheard of it from my cousin who said it was "so damn good". I never\u000awatched it for two months but when I got seriously bored I just decided\u000ait was time. And boy was my cousin right. This film is damn good. Andy\u000aDufrene is accused of murder due to circumstantial evidence which\u000aresults in him being sent to shawshank. There he meets Red and his\u000amates. Over the years they bond and share a powerful friendship. This\u000afilm tells the triumph of the human spirit, and how hope is a good\u000athing. The acting is top notch, direction and cinematography brilliant,\u000aand the soundtrack empathizes the film like no other can. I seriously recommend this film to those that want to see a brilliant\u000amasterpiece.9/10\u000a

V\u000aI have no words to express the feelings I got after watching the climax\u000aof The Shawshank Redemption.Very few movies touch you and still fewer\u000astays in you mind for a long time.Shawshank redemption managed to do\u000aboth.In my opinion "The Shawshank Redemption" is the best movie to be\u000amade up to date.I don't really have to tell about Morgan Freeman,he is such a pleasure\u000ato watch.Some scenes are so poignant that you forget yourself.I\u000aparticularly want to mention the scene in which Andy Dufresne plays the\u000amusic in the loud speaker so that the prisoners be able to hear the\u000awonderful music.The climax where Boyd Red reunites with Andy gives you a strange\u000amelodramatic feeling which only movies like Shawshank\u000aredemption,Forrest Gump gives.\u000a

V\u000aSHAWSHANK REDEMPTION is a film that makes one contemplate about the\u000avalue of freedom. It's does a wonderful job of drawing one into the\u000aworld of Shawshank state penitentiary and in the mundane lives of its\u000ainhabitants. It is presented as an almost "comfortable" existence as\u000athe characters live in solemnity and accepted their fates. It is\u000ahopeful film in a sea of hopelessness.SHAWSHANK stars Tim Robbins (in a quietly powerful role) as Andy\u000aDuFresne, a man wrongly convicted of murdering his wife and her lover.\u000aAndy is sentenced to 2 life terms in Shawshank and is extremely\u000adifferent from his fellow detainees. He is quiet, contemplative, and\u000amired in his own thoughts and ideas. This is how he copes. Andy becomes\u000afriends with lifer Red (Best Actor nominee Morgan Freeman, whose\u000abrilliant narration drives the film). Red has been repeatedly denied\u000aparole and has completely accepted his fate and that he will forever\u000areside in Shawshank.Andy brings a whole new view of life to the residents of Shawshank. He\u000amakes his fellow inmates realize the beautiful aesthetic things in\u000alife: music, literature, art. Most importantly, he brings a sense of\u000adignity and hope to the proceedings. The prisoners learn a lot from\u000aAndy and he even picks up a thing or two from them.During his stay, he must endure the wrath of the prison warden\u000aNorton(played by Bob Gunton in a memorably subtle, diabolical\u000aperformance) who hides behind the bible to justify his evil actions. He\u000auses Andy's gifts to serve his own agenda, which includes embezzlement\u000aof prison funds and tax evasion. His #1 henchman is the head prison\u000aguard Capt. Hadley (an imposing performance by Clancy Brown), who is a\u000abrute that has his own agenda at times. In fact, SHAWSHANK is a\u000auniversally well acted piece: William Sadler, Gil Bellows and veteran\u000aJames Whitmore all deliver exceptional performances as Andy and Red's\u000afellow inmates.The main appeal of this film is in its tone and deliberate pacing. This\u000awould on the surface seem like a film that would bore most people to\u000atears. Yet it is a highly regarded film and is very re-watchable. The\u000a"neatness" of the film is really what bugs me at times when I watch it,\u000athough. There is a kind of "emptiness" in parts of the film and it\u000atends to wallow a bit much in its solemnity. I think that I should feel\u000amore emotion in such a film, but it lacks in certain areas that I don't\u000athink that it deserves it's way-too-high rating on this board. #1 of\u000aall time? Or even in the top 10...of all time?! No way, no day!My big issue, however, other than the lack of grit and emotion at\u000atimes, is the racial aspect. You have an African-American (seemingly\u000athe only one) in a New England prison in the 40s through the 60s and no\u000aindications of racism, either internally or externally when he is\u000areleased. Films like IN THE HEAT OF THE NIGHT and DO THE RIGHT THING\u000aand even lesser films dare to either attack racism head on or at least\u000aacknowledge it's existence. Even in the prison world, it sees it\u000athrough rose-colored glasses. Then when Freeman gets released from\u000aprison, he strangely doesn't encounter any racism against him in his\u000anew job. Although this is my issue and I think the lack of grittiness\u000ais the bigger one. I also think it has a rather weak final act and gets\u000auninteresting near the end. I certainly don't think it's the #1 film of all time as many on this\u000aboard would have one believe. Then again, I don't think anything that\u000ahas come out in the last 30 years deserves to be in the discussion. It\u000aalways surprises me how PC the world has become and don't want to face\u000abasic truths that exist in life. SOME movies should acknowledge these\u000atruths and SHAWSHANK should count among one of them, no matter how\u000agreat it is in other areas.\u000a

V\u000aI was initially sceptical about watching this film, the movie's\u000aadvertisements never held much appeal for me but seeing as though I was\u000asitting bored on a Friday night I decided to give it a go.And from start to end I was engrossed The film really gives an accurate\u000ainterpretation to what life inside a maximum security prison would have\u000abeen like, I was left wincing several times during the inevitable\u000aoutbreak of violence. The film contains something for everyone, there's\u000asorrow, friendship, violence my main complaint was that there were a\u000afew elements I did not understand, particularly in the scenes that\u000aregard the accountancy work that the main character engages in.The acting was unforgettable, Tim Robbins deserves credit as the main\u000aseemingly devoid of all feelings, yet with that certain characteristic\u000aabout him, Morgan Freeman as usual shines through as the man who can\u000a'get things' and my personal favourite Clancy Brown as the sadistic\u000ahard ass security captain.I recommend that everyone see this movie at least once, it is without a\u000adoubt one of the great classics of our time.\u000a

V\u000aThis movie is absolute perfection. The story is about a bank teller,\u000aAndy, (Robbins)who is wrongfully imprisoned for life for the murder of\u000ahis wife and her lover. In prison, Red (Freeman) becomes his best\u000afriend. The movie progresses by showing the life that Andy has to\u000aendure in prison. For example, he becomes a prime target by a few\u000ahomicidal sodomites and obviously has to fight them off, which ends\u000awith him in the infirmary.The movie is excellent because it shows a very accurate portrayal of\u000aprison life, and the corruption within the prison by the blood thirsty\u000apower crazed guards, and the so called religious and honest warden, who\u000ais really a greedy sadistic manipulator who takes advantage of Andy by\u000aforcing him to do his taxes and make him work to make him rich.This movie may very bell be the best movie you ever see. It's real,\u000ait's dramatic, funny and has everything that a good drama needs. WATCH\u000aIT!!!\u000a

V\u000aThe Shawshank Redemption became one of my favorite movies years ago. As\u000aI watched it again on a whim just now, it so shook me anew that I just\u000ahad to tell the world how I felt. What I felt was the same kind of awe and irrepressible reverberation in\u000amy heart as when I listen to a Brahms symphony or when I see the\u000aceiling of the Sistine Chapel. This movie is art: it envelopes you,\u000ashatters you, and consumes you. Speaking of Brahms, this movie maintains an almost Olympian pace\u000asimilar to that of the composer's great works. It propels the story\u000aforward with engrossing tension but leaves room for reflections on\u000ahope, despair and redemption. The spot-on pacing, which derives from a\u000aserendipitously good combination of scripting, directing, acting and\u000aediting, gives the movie the feel of an epic. It seems safe to declare that The Shawshank Redemption has achieved\u000aimmortality, and that is its best redemption from its box office\u000amediocrity 14 years ago.\u000a

V\u000aPerhaps the best line in the film can also be used to describe this\u000afilm; a caged bird (the film) that shouldn't be locked up (at the video\u000astore)."The Shawshank Redemption" can be described in only one word: Powerful.It is my favorite movie.Let me give you a short summary. Andy Drufesne (pronounced Dufrene; and\u000aplayed by Tim Robbins (Bull Durham)), the vice president of a large\u000aPortland, Maine bank, is given a life sentence in Shawshank Prison\u000aafter he is accused of murdering his wife and her lover, run by\u000areligious Warden Norton (Bob Gunton) and sadistic Captain Hadley\u000a(Clancy Brown). He befriends fellow prisoner Red (Morgan Freeman\u000a(Driving Miss Daisy)). Over a few decades, Andy befriends the inmates,\u000abegins a library, education system and work program. But Andy is\u000ainnocent, and has trouble convincing the authorities of that, and the\u000afilm works up to the inspirational and excellent climax.Robbins and Freeman blend into their roles like chameleons, and the\u000ascript is well written.I will sum up the review in this one statement: go see it.You will not be disappointed.\u000a

V\u000aFirst I must say that The Shawshank redemption is with no doubt a\u000amasterpiece.It is important to say that these days Hollywood is not\u000amaking quality artistic movies,it is all about blockbusters,high\u000abudgets,commercial movies and special effects.Well,this movie on the\u000acontorary is one of the most important films of the 90's and maybe the\u000amost touching movie of all time.Full of or realist emotions this movie\u000atouches the heart of the average viewer in a very impressive and\u000aoriginal way.It is a tale of hope and dreams of freedom.In 1994,almost\u000aunknown Frank Dourbunt created a movie that changed the movie history\u000aand showed to people that in the day of special effects and extremely\u000agory film there can be a film totally different from all the\u000aothers.Morgan Freeman and Tim Robins are great in this movie and they\u000areally deserved numerous awards that they received for making this\u000afilm.There are many people who claimed that his movie changed their way\u000aof living and thinking in a good way and that is the biggest thing that\u000aa product of the 7th art can achieve.\u000a

V\u000aOK let me start with your most beloved TV shows.Like for example,mine\u000ais friends.The last episode,the last season is always a heartbreaker,a\u000atearjerker where you look back upon all the wonderful times and cry\u000ayour heart out that it will never come back again.The shawshank\u000aredemption does just that and believe me within a span of two hours.Man wherever he is,he is in heaven.He just realizes it after the time\u000ahas passed.You can kill man's body,you can kill's man mind,but how can\u000ayou kill hope.Man possesses a divine hope of spreading its wings into\u000athe sky even in the darkest of clouds.Imprisonment of the senses is\u000apossible,but how will you check the flow of love,it will flow till man\u000ais alive.We wish for a better future,but we already know that we cannot\u000abid goodbye to our present,however wretched it is because we still have\u000asomething to live for to hope for each day.Wherever man goes,if he has\u000alove in his heart,he finds love in others.Morgan freeman is as natural an actor as there has ever been one.The\u000asentiment of Stephen king has been instinctively been understood by\u000afrank Darabont and the final product is a lifetime of emotional journey\u000athrough the eyes of a hopeful, Christ believing good man.\u000a

V\u000aMy family told me this film was a deeply philosophical film which\u000arequired mature minds to be able to understand. I couldn't disagree\u000amore. The Shawshank Redemption is about a man going to prison after\u000abeing found guilty of murder of his wife, later to be discovered he was\u000awrongly convicted. The story goes from Robbins being a small fish in a\u000abig pond in the prison to being a respected figure throughout the film\u000aand various events happening along the way. This picture is the only to\u000amake me lie awake at night thinking about life and its dreams. I cried\u000aduring Shawshank and I'm proud of it, I've never felt so passionate\u000aabout life and its important things. The Shawshank Redemption is about\u000aLove For Friends, Hope, Death, Humanity and Loss. Thank You\u000a

V\u000a1994 was surely a memory of great movies. From blockbuster epics like\u000aSpeed proving to audience that young actors like Keanu Reeves can\u000adominate the spotlight to The Lion King where mixing Shakespeare with\u000aanimation can be a triumph. It was also the year of memorable movies\u000afrom "Forrest Gump" where retards and idiots can make a difference;\u000a"Pulp Fiction" was a wild ride filled with violence and language to\u000amake you have nightmares; "Quiz Show" questioned the stunts on game\u000ashows; "Four Weddings and A Funeral" proved to be a barrel of laughs\u000aand "The Shawshank Redemption" proves that drama takes place in all\u000asides and all directions.The films I placed in quotations where nominated for the Academy Award\u000afor Best Picture in 1995. "Gump" was the big winner taking home more\u000aawards and proving that a person of idiocy and a strong heart can\u000achange a person's life; "Pulp" won the original screenplay making\u000aTarantino a star; "Quiz Show" and "Funerals" had less nominations but\u000ano wins. "Shawshank" is remembered for being a small movie with so many\u000anominations that it didn't receive one award! Not One! There's a thing\u000awith certain movies where once they became failures, they become cult\u000aclassics. The Shawshank Redemption is one of those movies.Based on the novel by Stephen King, the film starts in the late 1940's\u000aabout a hot shot banker by the name of Andy Dufrense (a superb Tim\u000aRobbins) who comes home drunk one night before finding his wife along\u000awith another man dead. By the time the cops arrive, they see that Andy\u000ahas a gun with several bullets on the floor. They arrest him, but Andy\u000adidn't commit the crime where after a trial hearing, he is sent to\u000aShawshank prison where his sentence is double life; one for each of his\u000avictims.Andy is the fresh meat in Shawshank along with a couple of new inmates\u000awhere they meet with Warden Norton (Bob Gunton), one real mean S.O.B.\u000awho believes in two things: Discipline and the bible. Norton's right\u000ahand man Captain Hadley (Clancy Brown) is the true shark of the\u000ainstitution where prisoners think of the warden as child's play\u000acompared to the captain who harasses all of the inmates. Andy meets\u000aseveral old inmates from Ellis Boyd Redding, or Red (played wonderfully\u000aby Morgan Freeman), who's doing time from murder where he's the inmates\u000aright hand man in terms of getting items from toothpicks to cigarettes\u000aand knowing everything about everyone. There's also Brooks (James\u000aWhitmore), the old-timer who plays an important part of the prison\u000awhere everybody looks up to him. As each decade passes, Andy gets the\u000aprison involved in several little projects from helping the warden\u000aalong with the guards and staff with their taxes to creating a public\u000alibrary for the prisoners where secrets are being kept from the hero.\u000aThere's even a new inmate who enters Shawshank in the 1960's who knows\u000athe truth about Andy being set-up. Only time will tell when Andy will\u000abe released from prison along with having one of the most satisfying\u000aclimaxes in movie or jail history.This movie really deserves all the attention it earns.\u000a

V\u000aThis movie was easily the best one based on a Stephen King and Frank\u000aDarabont screenplay. Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman act very well\u000atogether as best friends who find a way to deal with their difficult\u000acircumstances. Morgan Freeman's name in the movie is Ellis Boyd "Red"\u000aRedding. He is a person who can get you things, for a profit. Tim\u000aRobbins' name in the movie is Andrew Dufresne. He is someone accused of\u000akilling his wife. Andy asks Red to get him such items as a small rock\u000ahammer and posters of famous starlets. Red is someone disillusioned by\u000athe racist prison system, and serves as the main narrator for the film.\u000aThis places the audience deeply inside the minds of the protagonists\u000aand even of the villains. I thought that Frank Darabont's directing was\u000aexcellent. While close to three hours, it is time well spent as the\u000amovie is well written, well cast, and well directed. A solid 10/10 and\u000arecommended purchase.\u000a

V\u000aTITLE: The Shawshank Redemption COUNTRY: USA YEAR: 1994 RATING: 10/10For me, the key to a good film can be found on the way the story is\u000atold, which is to say, the development of the script. Sometimes when we\u000athink of movie classics we always tend to associate with complex plots\u000awhile forgetting that simplicity can also mean greatness. A few days\u000aback, after watching "Sunset Boulevard" I could not stop thinking how a\u000asimple story could have been so well written and shot. I feel the same\u000aabout "The Shawshank Redemption". The story, per se, is absolutely\u000aordinary. In the hands of others it could have resulted in a bland\u000aproduct. But with wonderful writing and filming the story reached an\u000aentirely different level of density. It's the audience gain and the\u000amovie industry too.\u000a

V\u000aHope is a good thing - this is the best quote for me from the movie.\u000aWhen I am depressed, I watch this movie, and there is not a single time\u000aI have not felt good.From the very first scene, with a drunk and disturbed Andy, to the last\u000ascene, with a free and relieved Andy - I enjoy all the moments. You\u000adon't watch some movies, but you start feeling them, and believe me, it\u000ais one of them. Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman are exceedingly good in\u000athis movies and so is the storyline. Some of the best moments of the\u000amovie are - Andy winning beer for his co-workers (yes, Andy refers to\u000ahis prison mates as co-workers), Andy resisting the violent\u000aadvancements from the homosexual prisoners and getting beaten up each\u000atime but still never giving up, Andy playing the music record without\u000agiving an ear to the warden, Brooks struggling to live his post-prison\u000alife and finally committing suicide, the warden madly asking the poster\u000aabout Andy and finally discovering the tunnel, Red getting the parole\u000aapproved, Red finding the stone and Andy's stuffs and above all, Morgan\u000aFreeman's narration. The script of the narration is brilliant and\u000aMorgan Freeman's baritone gives it the needed effect.If you love true cinema, this is a movie for you. If you have not\u000awatched it, do it now!!! If you have watched it, I am sure you must\u000ahave done it more than once. The movie deserves it...\u000a

V\u000aIts difficult to put a finger on what exactly it was about The\u000aShawshank Redemption that I fell so in love with that I have seen it\u000aover and over again and every time there was a new element in the movie\u000athat fascinated me.A seemingly simple story of two men in prison and their lives over a\u000aperiod of twenty years.But presented with such elegance that you can\u000aactually relate with all the characters and feel bad for them,love\u000athem,hate them.A superb movie and an ever better adaptation of a\u000aStephen King novella,beating even one of my personal favorites 'The\u000aGreen Mile' in the process.The development of the characters is so\u000arealistic that you can actually see them aging,physically and\u000aemotionally,throughout the length of the movie.The story,in spite of\u000aits simplicity,keeps you glued to the screen due to the brilliant\u000ahandling of the main plot and various sub plots and how they come\u000atogether in the end.Every small,seemingly insignificant element merges\u000aseamlessly with the story which is rare to see in any movie these\u000adays.The lead actors,Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman both are at their\u000abest,although the better actor without a doubt is Tim Robbins playing\u000aan incredibly complex character and looking at ease throughout.This is the kind of movie that you will think and talk about long after\u000ayou are done watching it.The theme of never losing hope is somewhat a\u000alesson to all of us.I wouldn't dream of letting out the plot in anyway\u000abecause if you haven't seen the movie yet,just go and watch it.It will\u000amove you and amaze you like nothing you have ever experienced.10/10..simply brilliant..\u000a

V\u000aAndy is a former banker accused of killing his wife and he goes to\u000aprison. They are all innocent of course. He is treated poorly as a lot\u000aof prisoners are but he forms bonds with other inmates, especially an\u000ainmate named Red. From within the prison Andy helps with the formation\u000aof a library and helps others with money woes. There are good positive\u000athings in this movie but for the most part, it is a dark and cruel\u000amovie. It has a certain sadness that brings about it's greatness. The\u000amost important thing about this movie are the friendships that develop\u000awithin a dark place. I liked Jake a lot and thought that was such a\u000ametaphor for freedom although Brooks didn't know any other life. I also\u000aloved the ending and thought that it was the perfect way to end a\u000amovie.\u000a

V\u000aIt was really the film I ever watched, and here is why.Tim Robbins stars as Andy Dufresne, a successful young banker who is\u000asentenced to life imprisonment for the murder of his wife and her\u000alover. Andy is sent to Shawshank prison, a dour and depressing place\u000awhere brutality from both guards and other prisoners is commonplace.\u000aAndy makes friends with Ellis Boyd "Red" Redding (Morgan Freeman), a\u000alifer who has already spent many years inside. Red specializes in\u000asmuggling items into the prison for the other prisoners. Red soon\u000adiscovers that Andy is a most unusual prisoner, although at first it\u000aseems to do him little good - he is brutalized by other prisoners He\u000astarts to get both other prisoners and guards on his side when he\u000aoffers to help one of the most notorious guards with a tax problem in\u000aexchange for bottles of chilled beer for everyone in his work party.\u000aFrom then on, Andy always seems to be working on one thing or another.\u000aHe improves the prison's tiny library, and helps those prisoners who\u000awant to study. He also handles the guards' tax returns, and even helps\u000athe swindling Warden (Bob Gunton) cook the books. Over the years, he\u000agains the respect of most of the other prisoners and guards. More\u000aimportantly, he never loses hope for the future - a hope he tries to\u000apass on to the other prisoners. He never stops believing in life's\u000apossibilities, but to make the most of them he needs to be free.Based on the Stephen King (non-horror) novella "Rita Hayworth and the\u000aShawshank Redemption", this is a simple story of hope made remarkable\u000aby the interaction between the two lead characters. Both Tim Robbins\u000aand Morgan Freeman do a fine job in terms of making their roles genuine\u000aand appealing, and also in the way they work so well together. The\u000aproduction values throughout are outstanding, but this is not a "fancy"\u000afilm. Rather, it sticks to the story it is telling without resorting to\u000aflashy tricks to grab the audience's attention. Although there is\u000aviolence, some of it extreme, it is necessary to show the kind of place\u000athe prison is and is certainly not gratuitous. The main theme is hope,\u000anot despair, and the violence serves only as a backdrop to that\u000amessage. Unashamedly a feel good movie, by the end one is wishing only\u000athat it would continue for a few more moments.Bijan Shahrokhi\u000a

V\u000aKids who play unorganized games of baseball, basketball, or football\u000awill often make use of a "do over". The "do over" happens when the kids\u000acan't agree on exactly how legal a play was, whether there was a\u000apenalty, or what exactly happened. That particular play is forgotten\u000aand the game proceeds. This film is about a life "do over".By all measures Andy Dufresne (Tim Robbins) was successful: he was a\u000abanker, married to a beautiful wife, and living in a pleasant home.\u000aWhen his wife is murdered, he is convicted and sent to prison. While\u000anot guilty of murder, he convicts himself for neglecting his wife and -\u000ait is hinted - his privileged life. Prison forms the environment for\u000aeven harsher penalties for this crime. Ironically in his endurance Andy\u000afinds a deeper appreciation for simpler things: friendship, opera\u000aarias, and a cold beer after hard work on a hot day.Red (Morgan Freeman) is also serving a life sentence for murder. He\u000aslowly becomes Andy's best friend. Red is the prison's unofficial\u000aretailer and a peerless guide for Andy in survival. It is through Red\u000athat Andy gathers a close ring of friends.Andy's hope is born from the prison warden's avarice and hypocrisy.\u000aUsing his banking skills Andy is able to reward the warden's greed and\u000ahis friends. Andy organizes a prison library where Red and his circle\u000awork.Andy realizes he must act after the Warden reveals the full extent of\u000ahis insatiably evil appetite by murdering the only person who could\u000aprove his innocence.This is a long movie but like all great movies that isn't noticed.\u000aWhile it is guilty of being in the common genre of prison movies and\u000ahaving the sort of clichéd ending for which Hollywood is canonized,\u000alionized, cursed and scandalized, the true measure of this movie is\u000athat it still delivers a potent story. This is hope for the hopeless.Zihuatanejo!\u000a

This movie blew me away. I'm not a big Tim Robbins fan\u000abut he is perfect fit this role. Morgan Freeman is great in this just\u000alike he is in everything he does. This film has some of the best lines\u000ain it. When Morgan Freeman is narrating and says "The only one I know\u000athat could crawl through a river of $hit and come out clean on the\u000aother side..." It gives me goosebumps.

V\u000aAlong with The Green Mile, another excellent Frank Darabont adaptation\u000aof a Stephen King story, Shawshank is a masterful and thought provoking\u000afilm.Everyone in Shawshank is innocent you see - except Red (Morgan\u000aFreeman). The casting for this film, like Green Mile, is nigh on\u000aperfect and helps to create a fully believable tale about one man's\u000afight to prove his innocence against a system that doesn't even care.Morgan Freeman is masterful in his role as Red, one of his best ever,\u000aand despite originally intended to be an Irishman (you would expect\u000aCaucasian) is brilliant. See Driving Miss Daisy to re-affirm his acting\u000askills.Tim Robbins, as Andy Dufresne, is excellently cast in the role of an\u000ainnocent man, a successful banker, jailed for two life terms (in 1948)\u000afor the murder of his wife and her lover. Being innocent doesn't count\u000aand Andy is locked up in the hell-hole Shawshank prison. But his\u000ainnocence is a driving force. Like a bird - Andy wants to be free.To say the sets are impressive is a major understatement. While the\u000aexterior shots are of a renovated Gothic prison, the interiors are\u000anearly entirely built on a sound-stage. The production design is\u000atop-notch. You never want to go to a prison like Shawshank.The Warden (Bob Gunton) is a real peace of work - a corrupt official\u000ahiding behind The Bible. Clancy Brown (Captain Hadley) is a nice bloke\u000ain real life - you would not think it for he is very sinister in this\u000arole.Veteran actor James Whitmore as Brooks Hatlen delivers one of his\u000afinest performance in his long career - "institunalised" after spending\u000amost of his life behind bars - 50 at Shawshank. The world all these\u000ayears later is a shock to Brooks that has sad, no tragic, consequences.Overall this rather long film reeks of quality. Great cast, story,\u000aacting, production design, direction.Highly recommended - must see really - and one of my favourite\u000a"serious" films of all time. After I finish this I will put The Green\u000aMile on to make the evening perfect.Rating: 10/10\u000a

V\u000aWhat can you say that others haven't said about this film? (I notice\u000athere are 200 pages of comments). I'll try this: It is, quite simply,\u000athe best movie ever made. I have never seen a list of best films that\u000adidn't include it, and don't expect to until I'm very old.You can't go far wrong with great actors in a great story; add in great\u000adirection and great cinematography, and you have a classic. For me to\u000asay that a movie is better than 'Casablanca' is quite something, but\u000athis is it. There aren't many films that have had their titles changed\u000aeither, but down the years this one has simply become known as\u000a"Shawshank".Just a final note to mention James Whitmore, often overlooked in all\u000athe praise that has been heaped on the other leads. How he didn't win a\u000agong for his portrayal of the prison librarian I will never know. Yet\u000aanother inexplicable miss by the Academy.\u000a

V\u000aThat's right, this film is so amazing, it doesn't need to stand behind\u000aa flashy tag line in a review. this film can speak for itself, Frank\u000aDarabont's true masterpiece.Tim Robbins gives an Oscar-gypt'd performance as Andy Dufresne, an\u000aupstanding banker, framed for murder and sentenced to two life terms.\u000aThere he meets Red (played by the immortal Mr. Morgan Freeman, who\u000agives us the best voice-overs in movie history.) In prison, Dufresne\u000abecomes well known with the inmates for his courage, after being raped\u000abasically everyday for a month, and hope that the justice system will\u000asee him through.This film is a true masterpiece that can only come from years in the\u000amovie business, but Frank had close to none. He had only done two films\u000abefore that weren't very good, I guess this proves what you can do with\u000araw talent today.\u000a

V\u000aIt's been often said that the screen is merely one mm thick. The\u000areference is made a bit condescending to the depth of the cinematic\u000aexperience, perhaps at the time cinema was a novelty which, as a\u000amedium, told a story more facile than literature.I don't believe in the long way of achieving anything. That's why the\u000astory, unfolding over more than 20 years, paradoxically told in an hour\u000aand a half, in a manner which manages to express some of the most\u000aintimate experiences to being human, somehow ending up achieving epic\u000aproportions, truly became one of my all - time favorite in depth\u000astudies of the human spirit. And this due to a simple artifice in\u000adelivering the story, which probably is King's merit, but which has\u000abeen perfectly transfered to celluloid, the one quality, perhaps,\u000aseparating humans from the rest of living beings - hope, used as an\u000aincentive.As we gradually discover the humanity behind some of societies\u000arenegades, we also discover that true beauty of life lies in true\u000aredemption of the soul thru passion, the character of Andy Dufresne\u000atherefor achieving almost mythical proportions amongst inmates, because\u000aAndy is a man who cannot live without a project, without creating. He\u000abecomes a symbol for endurance, hope and redemption, but also of\u000aintangibility, because the path of the righteous is not only the path\u000aof the lonely, but also the most difficult, and thru a wicked twist of\u000afate, he goes through purgatory almost like a biblical character. Truly a human experience that shows how a man can master a destiny\u000awhich seems impossible to accept, and would most probably break most."Some birds are not meant to be caged...their feathers are just too\u000abright"\u000a

V\u000aI remember seeing this movie back when it first came out. I have\u000awatched it several times since then. I really like this movie, but in\u000amy opinion their are a lot of movies that are much better. When I look\u000aat the top 250 I cringe at this one. I think that movies like this\u000abelong among the top 250, but I feel that this one lacks what is needed\u000ato be towards the top of that list. Movies such as citizen kane,\u000aclockwork orange, or pulp fiction should not be lower on the list than\u000athis one. A good movie is one that is well written and acted. A great\u000amovie is one that redefines movie making and does something that has\u000anot been done before, or at least something that is going to be\u000aremembered forever. The godfather deserves top billing on the list. It\u000awas very well written, very real and had lines that are repeated daily\u000ain movies, television or in talk around the coffee pot. All I remember\u000afrom shawshank is Tim Robbins hands in the air after he escapes.\u000a

V\u000aThere is something about this movie that always hits me. Probably cause\u000ait's a wonderful metaphor of most of man's existence. I've seen it many\u000atimes during the years and the last one was even more beautiful than I\u000aremembered. So astonishing it didn't win any Academy Award, but very\u000aoften this is the price really good movies have to pay, and certainly\u000aShawshank has not much of appealing when glamorous, star system slaves\u000adecide what is worth and what is not. Probably if this movie was\u000areleased nowadays it would have received more attention from the public\u000a(see the contents of recent nominees for best film in the last two\u000aAcademy Award Night editions). However... A movie is great when you it\u000akeeps on flashing in your mind for the following days while you are\u000aworking or doing something else.

Redemption of the sincere prisoners.\u000aRedemption of justice. With the movie coming to an end, the bad were\u000adoomed, the good were redemption ed. It should be like this. Life\u000acycles.

V\u000aOne of better of all times.Shawshank as a metaphor for surroundings of\u000aa human being,unfortunately more evil averagely,Andy for wiser,more\u000ajust human in interactions with it.He confirms the rule that more\u000ajust,wiser live longer and better because their ability is closer to\u000athe Ideal,Absolute.This humans can go closer to All,Unlimited because\u000athey understand themselves and the world more and better.With their\u000awisdom they choose actions which lead them to lesser and lesser\u000alimitations.Andy is smarter and he sees the way out(a pipe) of bigger\u000asuffering over the river(closer to Freedom)which flows into the\u000aPacific(Silence,Freedom).That scene when he exits the pipe and lifts\u000ahis hands,smiling while the rain is falling on his face, is first among\u000amore astonishing in the history of film.On his way to Big Pax he\u000adoesn't forget others which need redemption.Red is among them (great\u000aFreeman who has the best last name a man can have and especially a\u000ablack man).He is a killer so he can only partly redeem himself.Andy\u000ahelps him and others showing them better way in life(cold\u000abeers,library,education).Red almost looses the will to carry on\u000a(Brooks)but Andy lifts him.And than the final embrace scene on the\u000abeach of the Pacific(Freedom)which is also among more beautiful in\u000acinema.Because of all that The Shawshank redemption is a artistic\u000amasterpiece which I watched and will watch many times.\u000a

I've seen it 3 or 4 times in 2 and a half years\u000aand it's still not getting old. I believe this movie was a masterpiece\u000afor everyone associated. Tim Robbins was truly spectacular in this as\u000awas Morgan Freeman, who proves he is one of the true talents out in\u000aHollywood. They were both deserving of Academy Award nomination, though\u000aFreeman received one. I can't still comprehend how it didn't win ANY\u000aOscars, though it certainly deserved Best Picture and 4 or 5 other\u000aOscars. But this is another example of movies being shot down at the\u000aOscars by fell good movies, such as Forest Gump. Nonetheless, this\u000amovie is a story about hope and how important not giving up is. Andy\u000aDufresne is one of the most interesting characters of the 1990's and\u000athis role and the role of Ellis "Red" Redding were written perfectly\u000afor the acting talents of Robbins and the Freeman. I am grateful to for\u000aFrank Darabont for directing a movie that is a stunning as Shawshank. I\u000aalso applaud the other actors, the cinematography, editing, and sound\u000athat went into the making of this movie. Though I remain bitter over\u000awhat the Oscar did to this movie, I will continue to put the Shawshank\u000aRedemption up in my favorite list, and praise it as a true masterpiece.\u000a10/10\u000a

V\u000aThis is the best movie I've ever seen, actually, I think it surpassed\u000athe Godfather. There are four things that I liked about this movie.\u000a1)The storyline is terrific and unique. A former banker went into\u000aprison of murdering his wife, but he hasn't done all of that. We\u000ahaven't seen this kind of movie yet. 2)The theme. The movie is about\u000aprison, in our impression, prison is a bad place, and everybody that\u000awent to prison will be desperate. But not Andy, he got along with those\u000aprisoners, and kept thinking about escape. That educates the people,\u000adon't give up hope. 3)The character. The main characters were\u000aimpressive, Andy: He was well-educated, and unlucky, hopeful, and\u000aintelligent. Red: He was friendly, smart, but he wasn't hopeful. He\u000adidn't know what to do after the parole. Anyway, he overcame it at\u000alast. 4)The acting: Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman did an excellent job\u000ain acting, and every single character in the Shawshank Redemption did\u000awell. Well, I think this movie has taken Godfather's place, to be the\u000abest movie I've ever seen.\u000a

V\u000aLoosely based on a 120 page novella by Steven king, The Shawshank\u000aRedemption (1994)masterfully present the concept of survival through\u000athe twists of hope and despair. Welcome to Shawshank prison where Andy\u000aDufresne (Tim Robbins) is a new convict, doing life for killing his\u000awife. Long termer Ellis Boyd 'Red' Redding bets against Andy surviving\u000athe first night. This won't be the last time Red underestimates Andy,\u000aan error Red makes in good company. Corrupt Warden Samuel Norton (Bob\u000aGunton) and Corrections Captain Byron T. Hadley (Clancy Brown) may\u000ashare in Red's mistake.The walls they become a part of you, warns Red. First you fight them,\u000athen you accommodate yourself to them and finally you can't live\u000awithout them.James Whitmore renders a bravura performance in the poignant\u000asub-plotted tragedy of Brooks Hatlen.There are significant deviations from Steven King's story line. Even\u000aso, both the movie and the novella are superior works independent of\u000aeach other.The performance here rivals or exceeds King's other prison yarn The\u000aGreen Mile.\u000a

V\u000aYear after another this movie has defended its place on IMDb's Top 250\u000amovies of all time -list and it has done in at the second place. Is\u000athere anyone who finds it kinda odd that it's on the second place\u000arather than the first one? I mean, at the Top 250 -list this and\u000a"Godfather" has the rating of 9.1, but when you click on "The Shawshank\u000aRedemption" it seems to have the rating of 9.2 and even more votes than\u000a"Godfather". Is it just that the staff at IMDb has just simply\u000aforgotten to update the list? Well anyways, to the review itself. I\u000ajust watched this movie last night and I've seen it once before as\u000awell, as I am indeed the proud owner of the DVD. The movie is just pure\u000aexcellence, or at least for me and it is no wonder it's ranked so high\u000aat IMDb. A perfect example of the fact that Stephen King is not just a\u000awriter of horror.What probably amazes me the most in this movie is that it's just so\u000avery well written. I mean, I think that a screenplay couldn't be more\u000aperfect than it is in this movie. It's just so good that it makes you\u000asmile throughout the movie, it just flows through so smoothly that it\u000amakes you think "How on earth can it be this good?" Pieces of the\u000apuzzle connect together in a rhythmic way, which make your eyes freeze\u000abecause of the harmonic perfection it provides, it makes you show your\u000aemotions: It makes you sad, it makes you angry and it makes you laugh.\u000aIt's just so good you don't want it to end. Just pure completeness.The cast is just superb, every right actor for the right role. I must\u000aadmit that I've never liked Tim Robbins so much, but in this movie the\u000arole given to him is just perfect and the role performance he does is\u000ahis best yet to date. No other person can make that cold glance he does\u000awith his eyes, the whole cold substance he has. There is just something\u000aso spooky in him. Even when Tim Robbins does a great job, even more\u000agreater job does the all mighty Morgan Freeman, who I think is one of\u000athe best actors in the history of the movies. The man just doesn't have\u000aa bad role performance, maybe even not an average one. His role\u000aperformance as "Red", the provider of things at Shawshank prison, is\u000afor me just so ideal. I think that the choice of him being the narrator\u000ain the monologue is just brilliant. Morgan Freeman's voice is just so\u000afitting to this movie that it almost makes your skin tremble. The\u000amonologue itself is also very well written and it progresses itself\u000aamong the whole screenplay in a so magnificent way that.. Well, I\u000aalready told you about the completeness.The one who is in charge of the music is the composer Thomas Newman,\u000awho I think is the perfect choice for composing the music to a movie\u000alike this. If I had to choose someone else, I think the closest one\u000awould be Micheal Giacchino, but I can't even think about that so much\u000aas the music in this movie is just so amazing in the way it is. The\u000amain theme of the composition is just beautiful and the whole\u000asoundtrack just simple blows you away. The chords build up this\u000aentirety and changing variations throughout the movie which can only be\u000aenvied because of the beauty of it. Just brilliant.I can't praise this movie enough, I feel like I'm still not\u000acomplimenting it enough, but in the matter of fact that's all I've done\u000ain this review. I have to mention the directing as well. It's just so\u000asmooth it collaborates with the screenplay so well, that it just is a\u000areal pleasure for the eyes. The director Frank Darabont really, quoting\u000aall the cliché's of complimenting, really captures the essence of this\u000amovie. It's just not the parts which make you the most amazed, it's\u000ahonestly the whole movie. I can't say directing could be more perfect\u000abecause it just is. In my opinion anyways.If you haven't seen this movie, you've really missed a masterpiece in\u000athe history of movies. I tried to write this review without giving away\u000aany spoilers, as the plot has some twists and tweaks in it as well, so\u000ait's also very original. Just see this movie and you will finally\u000aunderstand how it is on the second place at IMDb.The Shawshank Redemption shines even after 13 years.\u000a

V\u000aThe greatness of this movie is beyond the stellar acting of Tim and\u000aMorgan, the remarkable story of Stephen King, the flawless screenplay\u000aor the wonderful direction of Darabont. The Shawshank Redemption is one\u000aof the most beloved movies ever because it awakes something in the\u000aviewer.The Shawshank Redemption is my favorite movie ever. I feel blessed\u000abecause I was one of the few people that actually saw it in theaters in\u000a1994, when it was considered a flop. I was 14 years old, and i saw it\u000aalone in an almost empty Morehouse. Don't ask me why I watched it, but\u000ato this day I remember what I felt inside that theater. I recalled\u000afeeling different, somewhat inspired and anxious to talk to someone\u000aabout my experience. I bet every Shawshank lover remembers the first\u000atime they saw it, because is unforgettable and moving.You can say that thanks to Shawshank I felt in love with movies, and\u000athe art of movie-making. After Shawshank I have seen thousands of\u000amovies, amazing movies... I felt in love with Hitchcock, and discovered\u000athe classics of Wilder and Capra, felt amazed with the creativity of\u000aAlmodovar and Jeunet, but to this day I had yet to experience the same\u000asensation of hope and wonder that I felt in that empty movie theater\u000amore than 10 years ago. If you haven't seen this movie, buy it, because\u000ayou will want to see it again and again.\u000a

V\u000aThis story takes place in prison but that is not to say it is a prison\u000amovie, because The Shawshank Redemption is so much more.In all reality this movie is a story about human nature at it's worst\u000aand best. It's about friendship and loss, full of emotion, irony, humor\u000aand nostalgia. All wrapped around one hell of a satisfying plot twist\u000aand revenge sequence against the story's antagonists you'll probably\u000aever see.The icing on this scrumptious cake is one hell of a divine original\u000ascoring from composer Thomas Newman, the man who scored The Green Mile\u000aand American Beauty. It is haunting and often very moving. I realize\u000athat for many people one small segment of music in even a great film\u000aisn't enough to invoke a desire to watch the entire film. However there\u000ais a approximately 10 second segment of the score near the end of the\u000afilm that will break your heart. You'll know which segment I mean if\u000ayou see this film and if you're the right kind of person with a good\u000asoul, it will move you to tears. Somehow the movie manages to pull off an epic feel despite the backdrop\u000abeing prison bars and walls. You really feel you've gone through the\u000ayears with the two main characters in the film, by the end you really\u000afeel for these characters as if they were your friends. Making the end\u000aof their journey in this film affect you strongly. I would call this the best prison movie ever but for the fact that it\u000areally isn't a prison movie more than truly magnificent story that\u000ahappens to take place in prison. This is however one of the best films\u000aever made and I highly recommend it. This movie, especially the last 15\u000aor 20 minutes will stay with you for years to come. It haunts me to\u000athis day.\u000a

V\u000aThe Shawshank Redemption has taken place as my number 1 favourite film.\u000aI was really looking forward to seeing this and when I did, I knew I\u000awas in for a treat. This is easily the best film ever made. It's very\u000amoving and inspiring. This movie has no action scenes, just men in a\u000aprison who chat but not for one second i was bored. Frank Darabont is a\u000agreat director, as he also made The Green Mile. The fact that this\u000adidn't win the seven Oscars it was nominated for makes my blood boil.\u000aTim Robbins and Morgan Freeman give very memorable performances in\u000atheir roles. The narration, the direction, everything is flawless. The\u000aending is very heart-warming and happy.This is the best book-to-movie adaption I've ever seen. Infinity times\u000abetter than The Cat in the Hat (as that is the worst film I've ever\u000aseen.) It doesn't surprise me that it is #2 on the IMDb top 250. i\u000arecommend this to everyone who hasn't seen it. As said in my summary\u000aand the start of the review, it's not only my favourite film of the\u000a90's. It's my favourite film of all time. You know, I'm giving this\u000a10/5. It's just that good.\u000a

V\u000aOne of my favorite films, I saw it awhile ago, and this film holds\u000aspecial magic that took away the day I watched it any bad feeling or\u000aanything I felt about that day. Story about humankind above all, and\u000afriendships, and the power of people believing in you, in a yet real\u000away and not too cheesy way, that leaves you with a great taste in the\u000amouth, and charisma of the two characters is excellent. The plot seemed\u000aa little far fetched first, but again, character development and power\u000aof human behavior is what makes this film so great. THere's something\u000athat strikes you to the emotion, and some simplicity in the film as\u000awell, that the moral and theme is, enjoy life, and don't forget those\u000athat are dear for you.\u000a

V\u000aThis is definitely the best film I have ever seen, Tim Robbins Plays\u000athe Best Role Of His Career Portraying A Convicted Murderer In\u000aShawshank Prison, The relationship with him and "Red" grows through the\u000amovie, there are many ups and downs through his prison life and he\u000acomes through most of them, Tommy gives him hope of finally being free\u000abut the idea is foiled after not long. Then a perfect ending follows.\u000aQuotes Such as "Get Busy Livin', Or get Busy Dyin'" and "Hope Is A Good\u000aThing, Maybe The Best Of Things, And No Good Thing Ever Dies" more\u000amemorable from this movietruly amazing film I would recommend it to anyone, of you haven't seen\u000athis you must watch it before you die!!!\u000a

V\u000aThe Shawshank Redemption...where to begin? This is one of the best\u000amovies I've ever seen, it is an artistic masterpiece, both in story and\u000ait's visual elements.I am a fan of the Stephen King short story from Different Seasons (if\u000ayou have not read it, go out and do yourself a favor!), and I was very\u000apleased with Frank Darabont's take on the story. It remains true to the\u000astory, and even improves it, I think.The acting was also spectacular. Tim Robbins was phenomenal in the lead\u000aas Andy Dusfrene. He plays a great confident and quiet man, who has a\u000ahope, even when everything is stripped from him (the short story was in\u000athe section: 'Hope Springs Eternal').Morgan Freeman is also great in this film. One of Frank Darabont (or is\u000acasting director) great improvements to the film. In the story, Red,\u000awho Morgan Freeman plays superbly, is an Irish white man. I like it a\u000alot better with Morgan Freeman. I can't imagine anyone else. And I\u000acannot forget about the supporting cast. This film didn't have a bad\u000aperformance. I really recommend that you see this. It is a cinematic masterpiece\u000athat will please anyone who has a heart. Please, do yourself a favor\u000aand see this great film by the great Frank Darabont!\u000a

It's not often\u000ayou can become lost in a film lot but this totally draws you in.Probably the best film I have ever seen and a 10 out of 10 is certainly\u000arare by anyones standards. Not often can a film hit such a wide\u000aaudience like this one can. It is truly versatile in its production.Well casted, the characters are totally believable and at no time can\u000ayou doubt a reaction or performance.If you haven't seen this yet, you must watch as soon as possible!\u000a

Then i gave up revising\u000awhen i had enough of this stop start routine and watched it through.\u000aAnd i think its influential to any type of person out there, and if you\u000ahave time to watch it. As its most probable my "now" favourite film.

V\u000aFirstly, I must acknowledge that nothing should be called perfect, only\u000athe best, as its probable the future may....... most unlikely i should\u000astate, produce something greater. However Shawshank is definitely at\u000athis point THE BEST and to lift its rating i have only the option of\u000a10/10... I'd give her a 9.7. Others may have one or two greater\u000aaspects, but will be beaten in a strait up 'whats better and why'. The\u000aco-inhabitant of the number one spot here is THE GODFATHER, a movie\u000awhich is great, fantastic, a masterpiece..... it had a pretty good lead\u000ain with a couple of reasonably successful books i think (snigger).\u000aShawshank on the other hand is a quiet adaption of a little story by\u000aStephen King; yes it had a base but got nowhere in its original\u000acinematic run and is atop so many greatest movie lists because all who\u000asee it fall for it and force it upon all the meet that haven't seen it.\u000aSimple! There are many great movies (I just watched 'Children of men'\u000aand it was friggin great, poetic in its progression...), but you cant\u000ago past Morgan Freeman's magnetic narration as 'Red' and Tim Robbins'\u000aturn as 'Andy Dufresne', dignity personified....I think the best thing for all good kiddies is to watch Redemption and\u000athen try, one by one, to challenge all your other favorites against\u000athis masterpiece. Oh and didn't i mention there's a twist to rival 'the\u000ausual suspects', 'primal fear', 'fight club', the sixth sense' and 'the\u000avillage'... ONLY JOKING THE VILLAGE IS SO AMAZING, AMAZINGLY,\u000aINCREDIBLY STUPID STUPID STUPID I CANT BELIEVE I Didn't HAVE A VIOLENT\u000aOUTBURST IN PUBLIC AFTER I SAW IT!!!! oh, hang on, that was quite\u000atherapeutic....Anyway i just put The Shank on for my girlfriend and its just so\u000afullfillin (spelling?? ha) a flick for all ur couch lovin souls.\u000a

Beneath it lies the true\u000aessence of eternal hope. The hope to achieve freedom, the hope to\u000asurmount the jail walls to see the outside world,the hope to see a blue\u000aPacific..Its one of the greatest films of all times, and if you have still not\u000aseen it, then what are you waiting for,just go and enjoy it..

V\u000aWhen ever anyone asks me what movies I've really enjoyed "The Shawshank\u000aRedemption" is at the top of my list.Funnily though, it starts of with what almost seems like a 'B' movie\u000amurder, at least the way the initial scene and the acting unfolds. The\u000afirst time I saw it I thought I was in for a disappointment but how\u000awrong I was. It's a sweet ride all the way to the finish...and it's a\u000along way to the finish. But anytime the story hints at dragging a bit\u000a(and it does on occasion) the plot shifts and goes off on a new tack.The acting by all is superb. The story is great with a totally 'didn't\u000asee it coming' surprise leading to the conclusion, and you will\u000aempathize with Tim Robins in the lead role. Morgan Freeman is excellent\u000aas supporting actor and nicely ties it all together as the voice-over\u000anarration to gap the time intervals between different chronological\u000ascenes. After all, the story does span a period from the late 40s to\u000athe 70s. Yeah, it's somewhat of a sprawling epic but in a microcosm.This is a truly great film, a classic now and for years to come. I\u000acan't believe that it lost the Oscar to "Forrest Gump".\u000a

V\u000aFor all of you that have seen this movie Im sure will agree that this\u000amovie is the greatest of all time. I have three copies and I watch it\u000aabout once a month. I never get sick of it, i could watch it every day\u000aand still not get sick of it. There is not a bad word i can say about\u000ait. I just cant believe it didn't win any awards. I think everyone who\u000awas involved in making this movie should be extremely proud of\u000athemselves. This is going to be very famous for a very long time. I\u000ahave the most recent DVD copy of it and the special features are also\u000aamazing. I love watching the version of the movie where Frank is\u000atalking through it and explaining certain features as the movie rolls\u000aalong. It is so interesting to learn all the behind the scenes info. I\u000aalso love the feature where they show us the inside of the real prison.\u000aI cant believe how daggy it is and how small those cells are. It really\u000amakes you appreciate life and value all the positives and forget about\u000aall the negatives. It was great to hear from some of the former inmates\u000aand the warden of the prison. You can sense the emotion and eary\u000afeeling of the prison but they have had first hand experience and can\u000atell you real stories of what happened there on a daily basis in real\u000alife. Again, Im just so passionate about this movie and recommend it to\u000aeveryone, actually i don't recommend it I make people see it. I don't\u000awant anyone to miss out on the experience of viewing this movie so i\u000amake sure they see it. I have never heard a bad review. If any die-hard\u000afans want to email me to discuss the brilliance of this movie, please\u000afeel free, it would be my absolute pleasure to talk about this\u000awonderful film Amy\u000a

V\u000aFar and away, "The Shawshank Redemption" deserved, with every fiber of\u000aits being, to win the Best Picture Oscar for 1994. Morgan Freeman, who,\u000auntil "Million Dollar Baby," had been robbed of an Oscar for films such\u000aas "Driving Miss Daisy," had his pinnacle performance for "TSR."\u000aBeautifully crafted, totally captivating, and flowing effortlessly with\u000aFreeman's narration, "TSR," for all its gray colors, paints an\u000aexuberant portrait of life behind bars--the wrongly convicted Andy\u000aDufrane (Tim Robbins) adapts to prison life, all the while calculating\u000aan escape that spans three decades. Keeping his friends close, and\u000aenemies closer, Dufrane takes a seemingly innocent hobby and turns it\u000ainto a redemption that takes him to Mexico, with Red (Freeman) serving\u000ahis time and following suit.If there is a film that speaks more to the believer in all of us, I\u000ahaven't encountered it yet. It doesn't matter what hour of the evening,\u000aor what mood I'm in, if "TSR" is playing...I'm watching, and loving it\u000ajust as much as the first time around.It's been fourteen years...if you haven't seen it, ask yourself, "What\u000athe hell's wrong with me?"\u000a

V\u000aThis movie shows a great friendship between main characters Red and\u000aAndy. People should strive to gain an understanding and have immense\u000arespect for one another. Andy gave hope to Red throughout their\u000afriendship. I learned there is a right moment for everything, because\u000aAndy planned to escape from the prison when no one had any idea. When\u000athe warden was caught saving that money, by filing false claims, he\u000aended up killing himself. This shows that justice seeks to find itself\u000ain the end. This movie was shocking, because no one would have thought\u000aabout how Andy planned his escape. However, if you watched the movie\u000aclosely you could see hints about how Andy was strategic on his every\u000amove,like a chess game is played out.\u000a

When the movie finished, I looked at the clock and was\u000aamazed that 3 hours had gone by. A movie about life, about freedom and\u000aabout friendship. This movie is just perfect.Each time i see it, i\u000alearn something else. This movie gives you a different meaning about\u000afreedom. Great performances of Morgan Freeman\u000a

V\u000aFrank Darabont is a truly brilliant director and adapter of Stephen\u000aKing's more dramatic books. After I saw the masterpiece that was The\u000aGreen Mile I had to see this movie, I just had to. Now that I have I am\u000atruly glad I did. Tied with Requiem for a Dream, this is also my\u000afavourite movie and a movie I would recommend to anyone and everyone.\u000aEverything about it is perfect. From the inspirational performances\u000afrom the perfect cast (Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman being the obvious\u000astand-outs), the dialogue, the moving score and Frank Darabont's\u000aexcellent direction there is no flaw in this movie.There are no special effects in this, no action, just men in a prison\u000awho talk. But it's what they talk about that matters. All these\u000abeautiful themes of friendship, hardship, hope and freedom are in all\u000athese prisoners who we all come to love (well, most). Thomas Newman\u000aprovides us with a gentle and utterly beautiful score. It is truly hard\u000ato believe this didn't sweep the Oscars (not that it matters). Tim\u000aRobbins gives his greatest performance in this film, it's truly moving\u000aand he just embraces his character. Morgan Freeman also gives a\u000aperformance to remember and his narration couldn't have been done\u000abetter by anyone else, it's a beautiful thing that helps carry the\u000amovie.5/5. I urge people who haven't seen it to see it immediately, you will\u000anot regret it.\u000a

V\u000ai just love this movie. It is a must see for absolutely everyone. even\u000aif you end up hating it you will be better off seeing it than not :)\u000athere are reasons why the film should not have worked and reasons why\u000ait should, but because of the brilliant cast and excellent directing\u000aand adaption of Stephen kings novella this has become one of the best\u000afilms ever created and is superb in its entirety. i remember watching\u000ait for the first time when i was about 15 years old and it had been\u000arecorded and i missed the ending of the film, it cut out just after\u000aAndy fell out of the sewage pipe in his escape. I couldn't believe it,\u000ai had to spend ages trying to attain a copy of the film so i could\u000afinish watching it and well it as definitely worth it :) i have given\u000athis film a 10/10 and deservedly so. it is inspiring and brilliant\u000a

V\u000aI was bought this for Christmas by my partner and I have to say its not\u000anormally my type of movie but when I sat down to watch I was hooked\u000afrom the first two minutes I absolutely loved it was one of the best\u000amovies I have ever seen I never wanted it to end. The performances from\u000aMorgan Freeman and Tim Robbins are the best in their careers, they were\u000aboth very moving characters and you can feel empathy with both of them.\u000aAlso what else is a little addition to the movie that i thought was a\u000anice touch was the way the pin up changed over the years from Rita\u000aHayworth to Marilyn Monroe it gave you a feel of how the outside world\u000awas changing while inside stayed the same. This is definitely a film\u000ayou have to see and soon.\u000a

V\u000aThe 'The Shawshank Redemption' is one of the best film ever\u000amade!!!Personally i think it is the number one not far away from other\u000agreat films.What i love on this film is that it shows how people can\u000areach freedom and happiness even when they are desperate. It shows that\u000athere is always a hope and anybody can reach his dream if he believes\u000ain himself...When i first watched the movie i was very surprised with\u000athe happy ending.I almost cried. I also liked the Morgan Freeman's\u000adescription that makes the story more attractive. Other things i like\u000aon the film is that it 'talks' about life's simple and important values\u000asuch as friendship , partnership , fellow feelings and simple moments\u000aof life enjoy.\u000a

V\u000aThis movie was nothing short of amazing. I had watched it a couple\u000ayears after it came out but I rented it recently and I have watched it\u000aover and over. The acting is amazing, the suspense is great and the\u000aevents in the movie are gut wrenching, tear jerking and sometimes even\u000astomach turning. This movie shows you what some prisons can be like in\u000asome places at different points in time. The cast is great, with Tim\u000aRobbins as Andy Dufresne, an innocent man who is sentenced to 2 back to\u000aback 20 year life sentences for "murdering his wife", Morgan Freeman as\u000aEllis Boyd 'Red'Redding, an old man who has done years for a murder he\u000acommitted when he was a teenager, Andy and Red become good friends in\u000aprison, there is also Clancy Brown who plays Captain Byron T. Hadley, a\u000avicious prison guard with no remorse or conscience, and Bob Gunton\u000aplays Warden Samuel Norton, a crooked prison warden. I highly recommend\u000athis movie to anyone fit to watch a movie so disturbing in scenes. So\u000ago out and buy this movie, you don't even have to rent it to see if you\u000alike it, trust me, you will. I'd buy it but it isn't exactly an easy\u000aone to find here.10/10--Amazing..Highly Recommended\u000a

Captivating and so moving with\u000aso little in the way of action. Morgan Freeman putting in brilliantly\u000ascripted, brilliantly acted narrative. A film with many emotions which\u000apulls you in from start to finish. Genius Film making of the highest\u000astandard with some standout performances.

V\u000aJust watched this film for the second time so that I could answer the\u000atechnical questions I had the first time about why certain characters\u000adid something and why. Pay attention. It is fascinating.Aside from that, I easily give this film a #1 ranking on my personal\u000alist of favorites. I noticed that "The Godfather" is #1 on this web\u000asite. I strongly disagree because that film simply glorifies organized\u000acrime violence, while "Shawshank" is very, very moving, philosophical,\u000achallenging, and has MANY messages to get across to the viewer. This\u000asecond time round, here are the messages which I gained from this film\u000a(from most obvious to highest level order):1) State prison is horrible. 2) If you can't do the time, then don't do\u000athe crime (or even be associated by circumstantial evidence to the\u000acrime). 3) If you ever find yourself in prison, better to make friends\u000athan to make enemies - your life my depend on it. 4) Sometimes violence\u000ais absolutely unnecessary and wrong. 5) Every human being needs friends\u000aand acceptance. 6) What comes around, goes around. 7) Police officers\u000aand prison guards who themselves become convicted criminals have little\u000achance of survival in prison - suicide for them is the more attractive\u000aoption. 8) Hope can help anyone rise above any bad situation. 9) Every\u000alife is precious and irreplaceable. 10) Society can treat you like a\u000apiece of sh@t, can tell you that you are a piece of sh@t, and can even\u000adrag you through half a mile of sh@t, but you are NEVER a piece of sh@t\u000auntil you THINK that you are a piece of sh@t.\u000a

V\u000aIt is very hard to think of something bad about this film.The direction\u000ais incredible, bringing about highly memorable performances, and a\u000abeautifully shot film. Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman are sensational, carrying this film on\u000atheir shoulders as if it were the easiest job in the world - a tribute\u000ato them as this film must have been an incredibly demanding shoot - it\u000ais a long and emotional film. The development of their friendship is wonderful to watch, as is Andy's\u000agradual assimilation into the prison society - however sad it may well\u000abe.Frank Darabont it seems was the ideal man to take the helm of this\u000amovie. Many films in this sort of genre can feel like they are missing\u000asomething, as if there were sections left on the editing room floor -\u000anot this film, everything fits perfectly in to place. This leads to a\u000avery long film, (which could perhaps be its only criticism - be warned\u000ait is long - though the longer the better for me) but one which sucks\u000ayou right into the prison world, and keeps you right there until the\u000autterly stunning last shot of the film!Viewers should be warned that some scenes are of a disturbing nature,\u000adealing with issues that may offend some people. However, this should\u000anot put you off seeing this film. It deals with the realities of\u000aprison, and in no way glorifies the goings on. What we must realise however, is that this film is not necessarily\u000aabout the brutality of prison and the way prison society operates, it\u000ais about human connection and interaction, and the indomitable nature\u000aof the human spirit. By the last scene we should feel uplifted at what\u000ahas been achieved - not only by the characters in the story however,\u000abut by the film makers!This film is deservedly number 3 on the top 250 list! Congratulations\u000ato all involved in making it! A must see for anyone! Sensational 10/10\u000a

V\u000aThe Shawshank Redemption is one of the most well written, played and\u000adirected movies of all time. Incredibly humane and realistic, it will\u000akeep the viewers interest at top throughout the whole movie without\u000amaking him tired, will travel him in the same journey with the actors\u000aand leave him after the end with a sweet taste in his heart and his\u000amind. "Fear can set you prisoner, Hope can set you free" claims the\u000amovie and you will really believe it. This is only one of the many\u000amassages the movie is sending. The story is so real that is\u000abreathtaking. The acting is excellent from all the actors, even in\u000asecondary roles. It is a movie that I enjoy to watch at any time,\u000atouching me each time. It is really a classic masterpiece!\u000a

V\u000athis film is possibly one of the greatest all time, anyone who watches\u000aand thinks it is bad, they need shooting, love this film and can watch\u000ait loads of times and not get bored. upsetting at some points but still\u000aamazing. Morgan Freeman's character Red loved, him, he saw things on a\u000adifferent side, and a more realistic side, whereas, Andy saw things as\u000aa more fantasising which he always believed could come true. There are\u000apoints in the film which many would say, i have seen this before or we\u000aall know wot is going to happen, but in this film, you never know wot\u000ato expect, there are many points which are very unexpected. To end\u000athis, my word on it is amazing, i loved the film, and if this is not\u000aconsidered one of the best films of all time then i don't know what\u000acould be.\u000a

V\u000aThe Shawshank Redemption is without a doubt one of the most brilliant\u000amovies I have ever seen. Similar to The Green Mile in many respects\u000a(and better than it in almost all of them), these two movies have shown\u000aus that Stephen King is a master not only of horror but also of prose\u000athat shakes the soul and moves the heart. The plot is amazing, but King\u000adid great things with it in his novella that are only furthered by the\u000adirection, and the acting is so top-rate it's almost scary.Tim Robbins plays Andy Dufrane, wrongly imprisoned for 20 years for the\u000amurder of his wife. The story focuses on Andy's relationship with "Red"\u000aRedding (Morgan Freeman, in probably his best role) and his attempts to\u000aescape from Shawshank. Bob Gunton is positively evil and frightening as\u000aWarden Norton, and there are great performances and cameos all around;\u000athe most prominent one being Gil Bellows (late as Billy of Ally McBeal)\u000aas Tommy, a fellow inmate of Andy's who suffers under the iron will of\u000aNorton.If you haven't seen this movie, GO AND RENT IT NOW. You will not be\u000adisappointed. It is positively the best movie of the '90's, and one of\u000amy favorite of all time. This movie is a spectacle to move the mind,\u000asoul, and heart. 10/10\u000a

V\u000aI happened to watch this movie by accident. Me and my friends were on\u000aour way to watch some other film (I don't remember which) but found no\u000atickets and decided to watch this one instead. I remember sitting down\u000ainside the cinema with no enthusiasm and a sense of boredom. The title\u000aand story of the film did not appeal to me in the least.I could put in some fancy words and striking adjectives to describe my\u000afeelings when the last scene of the film was completed. But the truth\u000ais, you have to see the film for yourself to feel and participate of\u000athe emotions it projects. All I will say is I felt a better man leaving\u000athe cinema. As the tagline of the film says: "hope can set you free"!\u000aThe times we live in are frustrating and our chance to make something\u000ahappen limited. But when you watch a story like this (it doesn't matter\u000aif it's fiction, it might very well be true), you just feel compelled\u000ato try harder, to never give up! Most of us may not achieve what we\u000amost want, but it is worth trying nevertheless! About the film itself,\u000athere is no fault I can find with it. If I didn't recognize Robbins and\u000aFreeman as actors, I would have been convinced that they have done time\u000aand are just playing themselves. A great thanks to them as to all crew\u000athat participated in the movie! It is understandable that some people\u000ahave found this movie slow and boring, but I guarantee that at some\u000apoint in their lives, when they will be more able to identify\u000athemselves with the characters, they will discover its meaning.It is a great work, cinematography at its best! I can but repeat what\u000ahas already been said here: Take the time to watch this movie. It is\u000aworth it!\u000a

Simply Amazing, simply\u000ainvigorating, simply a masterpiece. If the 20th century's best piece of\u000aart was to be searched for, then search no more. This is the definitive\u000apiece of art that movie makers should look up to.

V\u000aAll the things that could have been said about this movie, have been\u000asaid. I honestly can't understand why this movie didn't won the Best\u000aPicture of '94. Knowing that Forrest Gump is a good movie and Pulp\u000aFiction a great movie. But both can't match the story told in The\u000aShawshank Redemption.Showing similarities to The Green Mile with Tom Hanks, this movie tells\u000aa story about hope, dreams and friendships. Furthermore it shows how\u000aex-cons struggle with the new world, once they get out of prison. I'm\u000agrateful that Tom Hanks didn't take the role of Andy Dufrense, as he\u000awas the first choice for the role. Not that he wouldn't have done a\u000agood job, but Tim Robbins belongs to this role. Just as Tom Hanks\u000abelongs to the role of Paul Edgecomb in The Green Mile.Every single plot in the movie gets equal attention and could be a\u000amovie on its own. Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman never played better in\u000aany of their movies. The rest of the actors are also very good. The\u000astory in this film is simple, but the way it's told makes it perfect.\u000aNot many movies can tell such a simple story with such class. Therefore\u000athis is one of the best films, but also one of the best stories ever\u000atold on film.\u000a

V\u000aRarely do movies come along that change a persons perspective on life,\u000abut for The Shawshank Redemption this statement is granted. From start\u000ato finish a beautiful adaptation of what movies are supposed to be\u000alike, displaying humanities most important elements, hope, joy,\u000aretribution and redemption, they all come into play and thats what\u000amakes it a cut above the rest. Society changes views on certain aspects\u000aof life but somehow hope always stays at the forefront, for change, for\u000aa better life. To change ones situation and to free the soul of a\u000aprison of emotion. Shawshank doesn't have special effects or big\u000ablockbuster openings and endings, but it does have one thing that is\u000amore deep and special, it has a message that appeals to the good in\u000aeveryone, that no ones situation is indefinite and that where there's\u000ahope, there's life.\u000a

V\u000aThis is not the best film of all time, and not even Tim Robbins's best\u000aperformance of all time. That would go to "Arington Road." Tim's third\u000abest performance of all time? Anything else, as these are his only two\u000agood film.Morgan Freeman (ex-Easy Reader, The Electric Company) has turned in\u000acountless performances better than this one (Glory is an obvious one),\u000aand the rest of the cast of 'Shawshank' doesn't even stand out. I\u000adidn't even know Bill Sadler (who is in a lot of films) was in this\u000afilm and couldn't even find the character he played.Let's get the plot out of the way: Andy Dufresne (Robbins) is\u000aimprisoned for a murder he says he didn't commit. Redding (Freeman) is\u000athe wise old lifer who mentors and befriends Andy. The warden, for whom\u000aAndy works, is corrupt. The action results from this circumstance, but\u000athe focus is on the human and social dynamics of prison. The supporting\u000acast was far too stereotypical, and the plot twists all very\u000apredictable. Nevertheless, the film was well-acted, well-shot, and fun\u000ato watch. It did not, however, move the earth.To rank this film above From Here To Eternity, put it on a par with\u000aCasablanca and Gone With The Wind, and to have it leaving other\u000aclassics like Ben Hur, On The Waterfront, and even Rocky in the dust is\u000aa bit much.Shawshank's other main flaw is that it is a bit too political in its\u000aportrayal of corrupt conservatives in power.\u000a

V\u000aThis is one of the most moving, beautiful movies I've ever seen. You\u000acan feel the desperation and the hope. I encourage everyone to see it.\u000aThe language can be a little graphic, but is probably appropriate for a\u000amovie such as this. Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman are surrounded by\u000aoutstanding character actors who only enhance their performances. They\u000aadd something to every scene. My favorite scene is that of "Andy" and\u000a"Red" discussing Mexico and the character of Andy sums up the whole\u000amovie with the line, "Get busy living or get busy dying". I've always\u000aloved this movie and watch it on TV whenever it's showing. I finally\u000abought the 10 years anniversary DVD addition.\u000a

V\u000aWhat can one say about the Shawshank Redemption that hasn't already\u000abeen said. I remember when it came out but refused to see it because of\u000athe title although I am a big fan of both stars. Besides, I had gotten\u000aso burned by critics saying that this movie is a four star or that one\u000aonly to go and see them and find that the movies mentioned were\u000aordinary or most certainly not the four stars the critics gave them.\u000aEven Roger Ebert is guilty of this. So, because of bad information I\u000ausually wait for the DVD to come out and that's too bad because I'm\u000adenying a good movie some money it could use in it's theatrical\u000arelease. But so many movies coming out just isn't worth my money. I saw\u000athe Shawshank Redemption in rental and turned around and bought a copy.\u000aI like prison movies anyway from the TV movie Against the Wall, the\u000astory about Attica to the Chicano epic Bound by Honor to the great OZ\u000amy all time favorite prison story. The Shawshank Redemption transcends\u000amost prison movies because it has heart and is told in such a leisurely\u000afashion that you can absorb it and enjoy the art and superb dialog and\u000athe brilliant acting without feeling hurried. Many posters have already\u000acommented on this wonderful movie and although I wouldn't say it's the\u000agreatest film ever made I do enjoy it and am glad that it's in my\u000alibrary.\u000a

V\u000aShawshank Redemption is truly an inspirational film--a work of art.\u000aWhat makes this film so special (asside from the excellent acting from\u000aboth Morgan Freeman and Tim Robbins) is the message of hope, even in\u000ayour darkest hours. Robbins plays a man sent to jail for a crime he did not commit--the\u000amurder of his wife and her lover. He is found guilty, and sent to\u000aShawshank Penitentiary. He meets Freeman, who has spent most of his\u000alife in Shawshank for a crime he committed when he was a young, dumb\u000akid. Freeman feels that Robbins wouldn't last past his first night in\u000aprison. But after being repeatedly sodomized by "the sisters" and\u000amanipulated by the warden, Robbins remains resilient and hopeful. He\u000agains Freeman's respect as well as his friendship. The men go through three decades of unhappiness as the pinup on\u000aRobbin's wall changes from Rita Hayworth to Marilyn Monroe to Racquel\u000aWelsch. Each one hiding a secret that grows bigger, with time.\u000aSomething that Robbins doesn't even confide in his best friend Freeman.After one final betrayal from the warden, we find out what those\u000aposters were hiding...The gateway to Robbins' freedom. I'll spoil no\u000amore for you...but recommend you watch this film yourself. It's quite\u000ainspiring and uplifting.9/10\u000a

V\u000aBeautiful. Simply Beautiful. The essence of this movie captures u from\u000athe beginning to the end. I found myself emotionally attached to the\u000acharacters in this movie. I don't believe anyone could ever surpass the\u000atrue, "essence" of The Shawshank Redemption. The game that Morgan\u000aFreeman brings to the table can't be surpassed with his calm-demeanor\u000anarration and always stunning acting and capturing of the true\u000acharacter of "Red" in the movie. The friendship that Red and Andy make\u000aalso will capture your heart. The mysterious Andy DuFresne is played\u000abeautifully by Tim Robbins. Other characters such as Warden Norton,\u000aBrooks Hatlen, Haywood, Byron Hadley, Tommy, and all the others, are\u000aalso beautifully played by their actors. The story is clearly presented\u000ain old-fashioned way that will capture you, like i said, from the\u000aBEGINNING.\u000a

Film is about a guy who gets wrongly\u000aaccused of killing his wife in a revenge style attack and gets sent to\u000aprison for life. Through-out the time he spent there, he came across\u000aenemies, friends and people he could use as an advantage for his plans.\u000aIn the end, the people that thought they knew Andy realised that they\u000adid'not know what he was capable of after all.I recommend this film to anyone.10/10\u000a

V\u000aBefore I saw this movie, it was hard for me to imagine why so many\u000apeople liked it. I figured it must be one of those gritty movies that\u000apeople like because of its harsh realism, but in truth it is so much\u000amore than that. In fact, I don't find it very gritty at all. I can now\u000aunderstand why it is the second highest movie on IMDb's Top 250 and why\u000aso many of my friends list it as their favorite movie. It is the most\u000aemotionally powerful movie I've ever seen and I doubt anything I see\u000awill top it.Tim Robbins plays Andy Dufresne, a man convicted of killing his wife\u000aand her lover. Morgan Freeman plays the convicted killer Ellis Redding\u000athat befriends Andy in prison. These are two very touching and true\u000aperformances. Tim Robbins should have at least been nominated for an\u000aOscar for the quiet intensity he brought to his role. He takes on the\u000aright sense of mystery required for the role and he gives the movie the\u000aconviction it needs to reach its emotional heights. Marlon Brando\u000aclaimed that some roles are actor-proof- the story is so good that no\u000aactor can mess it up. This could possibly be one of those roles, but I\u000acan't help feeling that a lesser actor would have overacted and\u000adestroyed Robbins's character. Morgan Freeman was nominated, and justly\u000aso (though it is an injustice that he was chosen above Robbins; they\u000aboth are equals in this movie). He complements Robbins beautifully as a\u000astoic man that understands prison life better than anyone else. He also\u000anarrates the movie; we see things through his eyes and experience\u000athings through his words. As in Million Dollar Baby, his voice provides\u000athe movie with its thematic focus. The supporting cast is fine, but\u000aJames Whitmore stands out as the prison librarian.The actors do not make this a great movie though. They were given a\u000agreat story and they lived it for us perfectly, but it is the story\u000athat lives on after the movie is over. Stephen King may be a pop\u000afiction author, but he has an extraordinary grasp on human nature which\u000ais brought to light in Shawshank.Marlon Brando also said that movies are good because of what we bring\u000ato them, and I suppose there's some truth in that, though there are\u000asome movies that are good no matter what- Casablanca and Citizen Kane,\u000afor example. I don't know which category this movie belongs to and I'm\u000aafraid that because I love it so much I don't trust myself to say. I\u000acan say, however, that everyone can identify with the triumph of the\u000ahuman spirit, and maybe that explains why it is such a beloved movie.It really is a shame that The Shawshank Redemption came out in 1994,\u000athe same year as Forrest Gump and Pulp Fiction. All three are great\u000amovies, and all three deserved Best Picture. But to me, Shawshank is\u000athe best of them all and will continue to resonate with me for a long\u000atime to come.\u000a

V\u000aBack in 1994, 'The Shawshank Redemption' opened to lukewarm reviews and\u000amild economic success, securing less than $30 million at the domestic\u000abox office. Though nominated for a very respectable seven Academy\u000aAwards, it failed to win any of these, up against the likes of 'Forrest\u000aGump' and 'Pulp Fiction.' Since then, the film has steadily grown in\u000apopularity and now stands as one of the most highly-regarded films of\u000athe 1990's.Convicted for the brutal murder of his wife and her lover, a crime of\u000awhich he claims to be innocent, Andy Dufresne (Tim Robbins, 'Mystic\u000aRiver,' 2003) is ordered to serve two back-to-back life sentences at\u000aShawshank Prison. Life is hard. The prison guards are brutal and\u000aunforgiving, many prisoners are ruthlessly antagonistic towards Andy,\u000aand the warden is greedy and corrupt. Nevertheless, Andy forms lifelong\u000afriendships with many of his fellow prisoners, most particularly Red\u000a(Morgan Freeman, 'Se7en,' 1995), the "man who can get things." Clinging\u000astubbornly to the knowledge of his own innocence, Andy never loses his\u000ahope that justice will inevitably prevail. Despite being a story filled with suffering and adversity, 'The\u000aShawshank Redemption' remains one of the most uplifting and\u000ainspirational films of all time.\u000a

But\u000aeventually I had no excuses left not to buy this DVD I heard great\u000areviews about it. Yet I still settled myself down for another movie.\u000aAfter watching the movie for 30 minutes I was already starting to\u000awonder why on earth I hadn't bought the DVD of this movie sooner. And\u000athe first thing I did when the movie ended. was playing it again. The\u000afact of the matter is that "The Shawshank Redemption" is one of the few\u000amovies of the last decade or so that you can actually watch over and\u000aover again without getting that feeling of "I already know how it's\u000agonna end".This movie is a must see for everyone and deserves nothing less than a\u000a10 out of 10...\u000a

V\u000afirst off, excellent movie. great characters. second, when Andy breaks\u000athe sewer pipe during the escape, crap shoots out. That is possible\u000aonly if the pipe was plugged up and under pressure. Even then the pipe\u000awould still be full of crap up to the hole after that loss of pressure.\u000ayet the pipe was fully empty when Andy looked in. Also, the only pipe\u000athat can drain directly into the river is a rain/storm drain pipe. Crap\u000awill come from only the sewer pipe which means that Andy would had have\u000aended up in a septic tank which is what most likely be used in such a\u000arural area. third, how the hell did Andy fit into warden's\u000aclothes/shoes???? how did Andy cut out the bible pages so perfectly to\u000afit the rock hammer? how come nobody got visitors?

V\u000a"The Shawshank Redemption" takes a look at life behind bars from a\u000awhole, new perspective. Rather than your basic break for freedom plot,\u000athis film focuses on the cost of adapting to prison life and how some\u000aconvicts, once they conform, lose the ability to survive beyond the\u000airon bars and barbed wire. The story takes place between the years of\u000a1947 through to 1966 and follows the struggle of one-time successful\u000aand promising banker Andy Dufresne. Dufresne was convicted of the\u000amurder of his wife and lover when he is sent to Shawshank State Prison\u000aand sentenced to life behind bars. It is in Shawshank where he forms a\u000afriendship with Ellis Boyd "Red" Redding, the "Sears and Roebuck" of\u000aShawshank and uses his "hope" to get through life behind bars. It is he\u000a("Red") who narrates the film which, rather than interfere upon the\u000astory, sustains and facilitates the film to make for an incredibly\u000apowerful and moving account of life inside prison. Director, Frank\u000aDarabont directs a magnitude of remarkable performances. Most notably\u000afrom Tim Robbins who gives an exceptional performance as Andy Dufresne\u000aand Morgan Freeman who's performance as 'Red' makes for a fascinating\u000aand intriguing film. Fine supporting performances also come from Bob\u000aGunton (Warden Samuel Norton), William Sadler (Heywood), and Clancy\u000aBrown (Captain Byron T. Hadley) but remarkably, one of the first-class\u000aperformances comes from James Whitmore as Brooks Hatlen. The scenes\u000awith him attempting to cope with life outside of Shawshank make for one\u000aof the film's most moving, effective and powerful sequences. "The\u000aShawshank Redepmtion" is a truly remarkable film and is utterly unique\u000anot just in the prison drama genre but in the history of film its self.My Rating : An Outstanding 10/10\u000a

V\u000aI liked this movie when I first time watched it but it was never my\u000a"the best" movie. Then I happened to watch it again and ever since it\u000ais by far the most enjoyable movie i have seen.Andy(Tim Robbins) is a true social spirit. It was after Andy's(Tim\u000aRobbins) hundreds of letters that was sent to the authorities\u000arequesting funds for the prison's library that they at lastcsent the\u000afund with the words "Please stop sending us letters". He teaches a\u000afellow inmate to get degree. It was the same student who told Andy\u000aabout a man he knew who has killed Andy's wife (for this crime Andy was\u000ain the Shawshank Prison). The Warden could not let Andy go as he was\u000ahis key to financial success. From that moment Andy was committed to\u000atake revenge. And he did it.Every second of this movie is spectacular. It is the best movie I have\u000aever seen and heard of! Enjoy every word of it!\u000a

V\u000aThere are not many movies that can touch me emotionally. Few movies\u000ahave done this and those movies are: The green mile, The gladiator,\u000aCrash and Shawshank redemption.This movie makes you feel like you have known the persons in the movie\u000aall your life. It lets you understand them and love them. It shows you\u000awhat true friendship is and that how dark things look there is always a\u000alight at the end and that things don't always go like you want it them\u000aand that you should do your best making the best of all situations.\u000aLike i have said one of the best movies i have ever seen, not a doubt\u000ain my mind giving it 10 stars. Gordon Freemans voice is a pleasure\u000ahearing and makes you really listen to the story.For you people that haven't seen the movie yet its about a young man\u000athat is a banker. Hes wife cheats on him and he gets convicted of\u000amurdering her and her lover. This young man gets to the prison\u000a"Shawshank" and has a rough time. Paying his sentence he starts to make\u000afriends and some of them are powerful. This gets him in trouble but he\u000ais always one step ahead of his powerful friends that become enemies\u000athat get him in trouble making life impossible for him. At last he\u000amakes it and everything goes as planed.Sorry if my short version of the movie is a bit diffuse but this movie\u000ais too good to spoil even a little bit.I know you will like it as much as i did.\u000a

V\u000aI watched "The Shawshank Redemption" last night with my husband, partly\u000ato see what the fuss was all about. I found it a well made moving film,\u000abut a little too sentimental. Red's character was complex. He was very\u000anoble (well, he is played by Morgan Freeman) but he was in prison for\u000abeing a murderer, and the speech he made to the parole board at the end\u000aof the film showed his dilemmas and the darker side of his personality.\u000aAndy was complex too as the other prisoners saw. I thought the\u000acharacters were too clichéd in the way that the warden and the guards\u000awere bad, the prisoners were good, except for a group of prisoners (the\u000aSisters) who were bad. Aside from Andy and Red, the characters fit\u000aclearly on one side of the good/bad divide. I would have liked to see\u000amore sides of their personalities. The film delivers some surprises by\u000athe end: it was wonderful not to have any inkling of Andy's escape, his\u000aplans for revenge, or his gift to Red, providing Red with his freedom.\u000aThe script develops the story skillfully and makes the audience care\u000adeeply about the prisoners, not just Andy and Red. I would have liked\u000ato know what happened to the prisoners after the corrupt warden and the\u000abullying guards were arrested. "The Shawshank Redemption" tells a\u000apowerful story well, but it would have an even more powerful punch if\u000ait allowed more time to discover the prisoners' inner natures: the\u000adarker tone of the "fishing" scenes at the start really isn't returned\u000ato. I loved Banks' pet crow and the nod to "Birdman of Alcatraz". That\u000afilm was a strong portrait of both the Birdman and the experience of\u000abeing in a prison. Ultimately, I didn't feel that "The Shawshank\u000aRedemption" gives a picture of what it's like to be a prisoner locked\u000aaway in a corrupt institution for decades. For one thing, I can't see\u000aan entire population of a prison reacting to Mozart on the loudspeaker\u000awith awe: surely there must have been more prisoners who prefer Hank\u000aWilliams.\u000a

V\u000aI first saw this movie back in about June of 2004. As I finished\u000awatching it a thought occurred in my mind, this is the greatest movie\u000aever made (of course I had just watched You Got Served so maybe that's\u000awhy I thought that.) Yet I found out I'm not the only person who thinks\u000athat. This movie gives many people hope, myself, teaches us not to give\u000aup. It is truly a cinematic masterpiece. Incredible acting by Tim\u000aRobbins, Morgan Freeman, and Bob Gunton. The Shawshank Redemption is\u000ajust a great movie. It has everything, a steady plot, a villain (if you\u000athink about it), of course a problem, and yet again, incredible acting.\u000aEasily my favorite movie, EVER.\u000a

This\u000amovie is my favorite because the ending (last 25 minutes) just keeps\u000agetting better and better and by the last few minutes you think it's\u000agoing to end and you want more to happen to make it the best happy\u000aending possible and it IS.

V\u000aShawshank Redemption is one of the most insightful and thought\u000aprovoking movies I have seen. With the character "Red's" narration, it\u000acomes across a little like a documentary because of the details of\u000aprison life presented. But we are being told a story in such a way as\u000ato keep us interested enough to hear the outcome.I view the character, Andy (at least later in the movie) as an\u000aundetected mouse in a board meeting or fly on the wall who observes\u000amore than the average person. Red describes him as wearing some kind of\u000acloak that shields him from the effects of the prison. This is revealed\u000aas hope later on. Andy somehow refuses to allow his hope to be crushed\u000aor snuffed out.He accomplishes so much during his incarceration, much of it due to his\u000aundaunted perseverance and redirected energy. It is brilliant and\u000ainsanely brave when he asks the guard if he trusts his wife. Pushed to\u000athe brink of destruction, he barely gets the words out to the effect\u000athat the guard can keep all of the inheritance if he gifts it to his\u000awife.The story reminds me of the Biblical Joseph in an Egyptian prison, a\u000adocumented instance of undeserved confinement.The spoiler that I have for those already initiated is: Andy places his\u000aown copy of the Bible in the warden's safe the evening of his planned\u000aescape. The warden is mocked when he reads his own quote to Andy inside\u000athe cover and the hollow for the pick-ax is revealed. I wonder if\u000aAndy's routine included locking up the warden's Bible, or was this a\u000aone time sting for the warden's sake?\u000a

V\u000aI loved the plot in this movie. Throughout this movie i felt like i was\u000aAndy. I wasn't watching Andy, i was Andy. And Morgan freeman was my\u000abest friend. This only says that the acting was superb. This movie is\u000aalways on TV and though i don't think i have watched the whole thing\u000aone time through, i have seen all of it in different parts at least 30\u000atimes, and each time i long that i haven't seen the movie from start to\u000afinish. So i recommend all to buy it, as its something i need to go out\u000aand do myself. Mordan Freeman is one of the greatest actors of all time\u000aand after seeing this movie, you will believe so. This movie is\u000adefiantly in my top 5 list. The only movies i would say have better\u000aacting is the first to god fathers.\u000a

V\u000aI have seen this movie around 10-15 times, and every time I see it i\u000adiscover something new and interesting. The story has one of the best\u000astory lines and the connection between the actors Morgan Freemam(Ellis\u000aBoyd Redding)and Tim Robbin(Andy Dufresne) is wonderful. The Shawshank\u000aRedemption shows what does go on in prison and sort of makes you think\u000ahows some normal people can become wise and crafty convicts. This movie\u000asomewhat reminds me of another great movie "One Flew Over The Cuckoo's\u000aNest" in that the character can go from completely normal to somewhat\u000anuts. And the cruel institutes in which people are put in, make excuses\u000afor their wrong doings, and treat people like they are dirt. I truly\u000aenjoyed this movie, and for whoever is reading this i'm sure if you see\u000athis movie, you will enjoyed just as much as i have.\u000a

V\u000aFINALLY! A site that got it right. The ranking on this couldn't be more\u000aaccurate. A wonderful movie that never once feels slow, pointless,\u000aoverdone, or simply, bad. It does everything right, and is a crime that\u000athis had to go up against Forrest Gump in the same year, and a shame it\u000awas so overlooked.What we have here is a masterpiece of film, something that just makes\u000ayou feel better leaving the theater than you did going in. It builds up\u000ato a man's ultimate triumph over wrong, and the best BEST ending of a\u000afilm ever.Perfect, as has been stated by 99.9% of people here. Because it is.If you haven't had the pleasure of seeing this (for shame!), to quote\u000awill Ferrel: "Go immediately to where ever movies are made-, sold or\u000arented, and watch it. It is delightful"\u000a

V\u000aIf you are open-minded, patient (possibly emotional or even\u000acompassionate) you will be happy by the time you finish this movie. If\u000ayou like films like 'Schindler's List' or 'One Flew Over The Cuckoos\u000aNest', then you will love this films progression and style.It has some of the very best acting you will see, the plot is superb\u000a(wont go into it here) and all sub-plots play out well with the overall\u000amovie tying up rather nicely. You'll most definitely be rooting for our\u000aguys:- Andy Dufresne (Tim Robbins) & Ellis 'Red' Redding (Morgan\u000aFreeman), two of the finest performances you'll see. Due respect also\u000agoes to the support, Bob Gunton, William Sadler & Clancy Brown with a\u000agreat early role from Gil Bellows (Ally McBeal).Outstanding directing, impeccable timing and excellent photography and\u000athe music was very chilling and uplifting, whichever was required. One\u000asmall let down IMHO was the running time of 2h 22m which becomes\u000anoticeable during its final moments but the film itself is generally\u000atight, the cast & crew did a great job here.9/10\u000a

V\u000aIn all honesty, this was one of the biggest surprises I'd seen in the\u000amovies in a long time. This is also one of the few movies that I can\u000asafely say that the majority of well minded individuals will find\u000aentertaining. But now, into the actual content of the film. For\u000astarters, the opening sequence with the imperial walkers is not only\u000aone of my favorite cinema memories; it's also a staple point in the\u000aadvancement of sci-fi films. Though the love story may have seemed a\u000abit trite to some, I found it tasteful and appropriate. Once again, I\u000awas blown away with the final light saber sequence and though I won't\u000aspoil it, let's just say that a very important character drops one\u000aspicy meatball.\u000a

V\u000aOne of the best movies I have ever seen, well acted, directed,\u000aeverything was perfect. . the movie is about a escape from jail. but it\u000awas totally different from other movies like "the great escape" "escape\u000afrom Alcartaz" . the shaw shank redemption is a different movie in a\u000asense that, its not only about a escape. its classic, emotionally\u000ainspiring,its about a hope("Fear can hold you prisoner. Hope can set\u000ayou free". .then The twist that makes you worth watching it all along\u000aand leaves you with tremendous wonder. It's a good thing though, even\u000afor those of you who is too dumb to watch character driven drama and\u000aprefer mindless action movies. Tim Robbins and Morgen freeman were\u000agreat. fine performances without the use of a lot of violence or\u000agraphic violence to get attention.\u000a

V\u000aSince "The Shawshank Redemption" was released in 1994, it has been\u000aplayed on various cable channels (TNT, TBS, etc) approximately 130,842\u000atimes. You know what: it keeps getting better and better. If the cable\u000anetworks developed a Shawshank channel, it would consistently receive\u000ahigher cable ratings than any other channel (even if they played the\u000apan and scan version, instead of the widescreen). The movie is that\u000agood.Every element of the film is near perfect. I have watched the movie in\u000aits entirety at least 10 times and I get something new from it each\u000atime.

V\u000aThe summary pretty much says everything for me. The movie is about\u000ahope. It's about freedom, and the iron will it takes to persevere and\u000acome through from even the darkest times. The final scene where the\u000acamera pans out to reveal Red walking towards Andy on the beach is one\u000aof the most happy and complete endings I've ever seen in a movie, and\u000ait moves me every time I see it. I love this movie. The fact that it\u000adid not win Best Picture taints the academy awards.

V\u000aI wrote my first review of this movie back in 2006. I feel I did not do\u000ait the justice it deserved.I grew up in Mansfield, OH, not very far at all from the Ohio State\u000aReformatory. The old "castle Dracula" Administration building is all\u000athat is left now. A new prison (Mansfield Correctional Institution) was\u000abuilt on the site where the other buildings existed along OH-13. I\u000aremember the impending demolition just waiting for this movie to finish\u000afilming......Thank God it waited! The story begins in 1946 when Portland banker\u000aAndy Dufresne is tried for and wrongfully convicted of the double\u000amurder of his wife and her "lover".Andy arrives at Shawshank state prison in early 1947 and is greeted\u000aharshly by ruthless authority and by thugs who seem to enjoy beating\u000ahim up. Andy keeps strong and keeps very much to himself for the first\u000atwo years.Andy finally decides he needs a hobby to keep his mind occupied. He\u000aapproaches the well known prison entrepenour, "Red", and asks if Red\u000amight smuggle something into the prison for him... This kick starts the\u000arelationship between Red and Andy that the movie centers its attention\u000aon.There is a gentle tug of war between the two regarding ideals. Red,\u000aguilty of murder and sentenced to life with parole, sees no hope in\u000aexistence outside of the prison walls. He tries, throughout the film,\u000ato convey to Andy that "hope can drive a man insane" and its best to\u000ajust accept your fate. Opposites must attract because Andy was Red's\u000apolar opposite and it began to catch Red's attention. Andy would\u000aconfront the police guard to ask for beers for his friends. He'd play\u000amusic over the Shawshank PA system from the Warden's office. He'd write\u000athe state once or twice a week for years and years to get funds for a\u000anew library. Andy Dufresne dared to dream and he turned the negativity\u000aof Shawshank on its head...and just may have changed Red's view on\u000athings.The villain in the movie is Warden Norton. The Warden notices Andy's\u000askills and intelligence early on and took full advantage. He entices\u000aAndy to be sort of an "administrative assistant". He started out in\u000adoing tax returns for the guards, which he was very good at. In time,\u000athe Warden enticed him to use his banking skills to mastermind a money\u000alaundering scheme that would make the Warden "a millionaire when he\u000aretires". Andy had to "go to prison to be a crook". This kept his mind\u000aoccupied.About 2/3 the way through the film, a young kid is admitted to\u000aShawshank who knows who killed Andy's wife 19 years before. Andy is\u000aecstatic and he takes the news to the Warden. At risk of the money\u000alaundering scandel being brought to light, the Warden ensures Andy he's\u000anot leaving Shawshank. Andy gets two months in the hole. The young kid\u000agets shot.Andy, the beacon of hope for this movie, decides HE WILL get out. And\u000aHE WILL get his freedom.We go back to Andy's first meeting with Red 19 years before the\u000aescape...the little chess piece chiseling 6" rock hammer that he asked\u000afor... He'd been chipping away at the concrete wall in his room for 19\u000ayears and NOBODY SAW IT COMING.Andy busts out of that stinkin place, crawls through a 500 yard\u000asanitary line and "comes out clean on the other side". Andy is gone and\u000ais free like a bird.Red, with his inspirational friend gone, does begin to lose that hope\u000athat Andy almost convinced him of. Life at the prison begins to suck.\u000aRed, after 40 years, gets paroled. He has no idea how to adapt on the\u000aoutside. He might just commit suicide.Only one thing stops him...a promise he made to Andy... Determined, Red\u000aputs on his hat and suit, clamps his travel case shut. Give busy livin,\u000aor get busy dyin...thats god damn right. He bolts town and meets up\u000awith Andy on the beach in Mexico. Red, once a young crook, now redeemed\u000aold man.\u000a

V\u000aThis is a fantastic film and deserved the countless awards that it was\u000agiven during the 1990's! The film is visually astounding with a\u000afantastic cast of legendary actors. Films that have twists are always\u000aimpressive and Frank Darabont does this film justice by creating an\u000aoriginal and at times, very moving screenplay. I would suggest that\u000aanyone watches this film as it takes its audience on a roller-coaster\u000aof emotions from pity towards Andy Dufresne (Tim Robbins) at the start\u000aof this movie when he is convicted of murdering his wife, to the moving\u000aperformance by James Whitmore as Brooks Hatlen, the lonely and\u000a'institutionalised' old prisoner. The ending made me cry and made me want to go and visit the 'big\u000ahayfield up near Buxton'!! I must have watched this film hundreds of\u000atimes and I still get nervous when Warden Samuel Norton (Bob Gunton)\u000agoes into Andy Dufresne's cell and realises something astounding about\u000athe prisoner...\u000a

V\u000aFor those of you who rated this movie a 1/10: Shame on You! There is no\u000away, even if you don't personally love the movie, that you can deny\u000ait's one of the best movies ever made. Just like there are some people\u000awho may not have personally loved the Godfather, Citizen Kane,\u000aShindler's List, etc. and, therefore, gave those movies a 1/10. That's\u000aa bunch of crap. I personally didn't love the Godfather, but thats\u000abecause it's not exactly my type of movie. That doesn't mean I bashed\u000ait and gave it a 1/10. I could see right away all the great qualities\u000athe movie had. So for those of you who voted 1/10 for shaw-shank, ask\u000ayourselves if it was really that bad, or was it just that you\u000apersonally didn't enjoy it as much as everybody else...My guess is you\u000awould respond truthfully to the latter, so at least give it a 7, 8, or\u000a9, not a 1. Thats all I have to say about that.Now about the movie...The writing, the acting, the the music, the\u000atheme, etc. It's all as close to perfect as you will find in a movie. I\u000adon't want to write any spoilers, so let me just say that each and\u000aevery scene of this movie is well crafted. It's the type of movie that\u000akeeps you on your toes from beginning to end. This is one of the only\u000amovies that I can remember that was so good, I forgot I was watching a\u000amovie. You can connect with the characters on such a personal level.\u000aEverything they do feels real. Nothing is under or overblown. TIm\u000aRobbins was the perfect cast for Andy Dufrane. Robbins' melodramatic\u000apersonality lends itself perfectly to his character (Andy). As a\u000aviewer, you can never really tell what Andy is doing or thinking.\u000aUnlike most heroes, Andy doesn't make his objective clear to the\u000aaudience. Morgan Freeman is the perfect actor for the character Red.\u000aListening to him narrate the story is a real treat. I don't want to say\u000aanymore for those of you who haven't watched the movie yet. If you are\u000aone of those people, I wouldn't skip out on this movie. You will be\u000adoing yourself a disservice by missing this film. One of the best.\u000a

V\u000aIf you can't watch a movie which doesn't contain any explosions, wild\u000acar chases or corrupt cops, then this movie probably isn't for you.\u000aHowever, if you enjoy a good story with great acting and execution,\u000athen you really should look into "The Shawshank Redemption".So why is the movie so good? The movie as a whole is simply\u000abreath-taking. In addition to the exceptional story, everything is\u000a"just right". I've seen loads of movies with good stories, but most of\u000athem seem to fail in other aspects (poor acting, poor camera-work and\u000asuch) making the movie as a whole not live up to its potential. "The\u000aShawshank Redemption" is NOT one of them. It actually manages to pull\u000ait off, resulting in what I deem to be one of the best movies ever\u000amade. I give it a 10/10, without any hesitation.\u000a

The way the director captures human\u000aemotion, makes this one hell of a great prison movie.The movie is great at the start, but none better when it comes closer\u000ato the end. Believe me, there will be a point your jaw will just hang\u000aopen in amazement. I love this movie, if you've not watched it, please\u000ado so...\u000a

V\u000aSome individuals get bored with the beginning of the movie because of\u000athe slow pace, but one has to remember this isn't about action its\u000aabout drama and a well told story, and the ending makes me smile every\u000atime. The well chosen dialog in the start shows the viewer this is not\u000aabout your normal prison movie or any sorta of manner that could be\u000aincluded in that genre, but instead has well thought out banter. The\u000acinematography is nothing new to any of us but thats not so important\u000aas the story and the way the angles show what need to be shown.\u000aSimplely put its a beautiful story, well written by King and is shot\u000aand made very worth peoples while. My mother watched it for the very\u000afirst time a few weeks ago, before always complaining that it was\u000aboring and she could never get into it, now she sings it praise.\u000a

V\u000a"Fear can hold you prisoner, hope can set you free." What a great tag\u000aline. It makes you think of how good your life is when you get to be\u000afree.It is hard for me to put my feelings into words because "The Shawshank\u000aRedemption" is one of that kind of movies that makes you think. The\u000amovie has been very educating for me."The Shawshank Redemption" is not an ordinary prison-movie. It is an\u000aepic story about friendship. I almost start to weep when I think of Red\u000a(outstanding Morgan Freeman) and Andy's (excellent Tim Robbins) strong\u000arelationship! In the film Tim Robbins' character, banker Andy Dufresne\u000ais being accused to have murdered his wife and his lover while they\u000awere having an intimate moment. The jury finds the defendant guilty as\u000acharged and Andy is sent to the infamous Shawshank prison which was\u000aknown for its cruel punishments for misbehaving. While being a new meet\u000ain prison Andy is being harassed by the Sisters, inmates who want to\u000ataste some of that fresh meet. Everything happens on Red's point of\u000aview. Red is the guy who can get almost anything you want by smuggling\u000astuff in. He is a provider who will someday give Andy the key; Rita\u000aHayworth.The film is full of injustice but even if you are locked up you can\u000afind your soul-mates. Also after being imprisoned for a long time it\u000awill grow on you. It becomes your home. But not for Andy. He knows he's\u000ainnocent. Maybe the Shawshank isn't so hard to crack..."The Shawshank Redemption" is based on a short story by no other than\u000aking of horror Stephen King. I have found his prison-movies to be very\u000avery good because, well, the pictures about his stories have always\u000abeen little downbeat. Maybe because of the supernatural side, I guess.\u000aI have this short story on my bookshelf and it's almost as same as the\u000amovie. The only thing's that different in the short story is that Red\u000awas a ginger-haired, white Irishman. Freeman's Red is also Irish but we\u000aall know the difference. It doesn't make any difference, really.The lesson of this movie is to never give up hope. Life can sure kick\u000ayou but kick back. Be smarter than life."I hope I can get across the border. I hope to see my friend, and shake\u000ahis hand. I hope that the Pasific is as blue as it has been in my\u000adreams. I hope." -Red\u000a

V\u000aI doubt anyone can argue, that this Movie is the greatest one ever\u000amade. If there is no better movie ever made I will not be disappointed.\u000aMore about that later though, one of the movie's strongest aspects, the\u000aacting.Before watching this movie I had never heard of Tim Robbins, and after\u000awas left wondering why, the way he developed the character of Andrew\u000aDufresne was incredible, why he hasn't been in many, many more big\u000aproductions.But the real star in this Movie was Morgan Freeman,maybe it was because\u000ahe's Irish, his role as Red the 'The man who knows how to get things'\u000awas incredible. A convicted murderer, and the only guilty man in\u000ashawshank really was what made the movie, amongst other things, so\u000agood. He would have to be the best narrator EVER!! he makes you feel as\u000athough when he speaks, you're him watching the events unfold as they\u000ahappen from his perspective.The other co-stars all put in great performances, notabley Bob Gunton\u000aas the Warden, William Sadler as Heywood a fellow inmate and James\u000aWhitmore as Brooks. Clancy Brown did a great job of making you hate his\u000acharacter Captain Hadley, at some parts you just wanted reach through\u000athe screen and kill him yourself. And Mark Rolsten as Boggs the gay\u000aprisoner, made you shudder.But the highlight of the acting was on the on screen chemistry between\u000aTim Robbins and Morgn Freeman the best male lead duo that I have ever\u000aseen, the way they inspire each other and the conversations they share\u000aadd another dimension to the movie.The plot is good, with the ending coming as a complete surprise to me,\u000aprobably because i was expecting something a little different to what I\u000ahad expected, which is what makes this movie brilliant. Frank Darabout\u000ahas done a great job as Director as he has shown us again later in the\u000aGreen Mile. I cant believe this film did not perform in the Cinemas or\u000adid not win any awards. Words cannot possibley describe in detail just\u000ahow good this movie is, go and see it for yourself, but be prepared for\u000asome real, prison violence. And remember, a good thing never dies.\u000a

V\u000aIt's a shame that The Shawshank Redemption was never as critically or\u000acommercially successful during it's run in theatres, as perhaps it\u000ashould have been. If it were, then maybe the travesty of having Forrest\u000aGump take the 1994 Best Picture Oscar could have been avoided, the\u000aaward collected, instead, by either by this film or by Tarantino's\u000agroundbreaking Pulp Fiction, which were both stronger efforts. But I\u000adigress.Beginning in 1946, Andy Dufresne (Tim Robbins) is convicted for the\u000amurders of his wife and her lover. He's sentenced to serve two life\u000aterms back to back in Shawshank Prison, ruled with an iron fist by the\u000aWarden Samuel Norton (Bob Gunton) and the foul-mouthed, violent Captain\u000aByron Hadley (Clancy Brown). Shawshank, Andy soon discovers, is a place\u000aof corruption and injustice, which begins at the Guards and stretches\u000ato the Warden himself, and includes a group of sodomites known as "the\u000aSisters". Amidst this, Andy finds himself part of an unlikely group of\u000afriends, Red (Morgan Freeman), the "man who knows how to get things"\u000aand Brooks (James Whitmore), the good-natured, aging old-timer and\u000alibrarian, among them. As we watch these men through the next 20 years\u000aof prison life, a tragic subplot develops with the Brooks character\u000awhich deals with the nature of spending too long behind bars, and how,\u000aeventually, the bars and walls of prison can influence even a man of\u000aBrooks' good nature.When a young convict arrives at Shawshank with proof that Andy is\u000ainnocent, injustice at the prison rears it's ugly head. Andy is faced\u000awith a choice to make  "get busy livin', or get busy dying"  and he\u000adoes just that, propelling the film from that point forward into a\u000arousing, uplifting climax which tests the bonds of friendship between\u000ahimself and Red, and ultimately provides the audience with an important\u000amessage about hope, salvation, and redemption.Writer/director Darabont reclines in his role and lets Shawshank's\u000amodestly-paced, subdued screenplay flow through it's 142 minutes. The\u000afilm achieves the rare state of never seeming to drag or feel rushed.\u000aThere's no flashy action here; rather, Darabont allows his audience to\u000abe compelled by the dialogue and the array of terrific performances,\u000afrom the assured conviction with which Robbins believes in his\u000ainnocence, to the thoughtful grace of Freeman's Red.\u000a

V\u000aThis is one of my all time favorite movies. It's about a man who is\u000asent to prison for killing his wife, only he claims he didn't do it. He\u000athen makes friends with the inmates.It is a long movie, but watching it, you wouldn't know. It feels like\u000ait was a few minutes long. As a plus, it doesn't even feel like a\u000amovie. The characters are so well played, you think someone was filming\u000athem for some reality show or something (cthe camera angles are\u000aamazing, no reality show-like parts like on Law and Order). This is a\u000agreat movie, though not for all. It is a prison movie and has the\u000acliché moments like the guards being cruel and things like that\u000a(everyone claiming to be innocent saying "The lawyer F***ed me!") It\u000ahas actually convinced millions all over the place not to commit\u000asuicide or to stop cutting themselves and even leaving violent\u000ahusbands/wives. This is a movie Everyone should TRY and watch.Recommendations: The Green MileRoad to Perditon\u000a

I wouldn't want to spoil the movie for someone who hasn't\u000aseen it. All i can say is watch it!! this movie should not in anyway be\u000aturned down because "it is just a prison movie" this movie is much more\u000athan this...It is really cheep as well, if you want to buy it in HMV i bought it\u000afrom there for £1.99 which i thought was an absolute bargain!! go buy\u000ait for yourself now if you haven't got it!!\u000a

One of the best adaptations and truest to the original Stephen King\u000astories that I have seen. The other being "The Green Mile". The combination of musical score with the well written and delivered\u000alines of Morgan Freemans narration still can well the tears up in my\u000aeyes. His narration and acting in this film surely should have garnered\u000ahim an Academy Award! He's an American Icon in my book.

V\u000aI have seen this movie at least a dozen times and I will probably watch\u000ait a dozen more. It is a feel good movie with excellent acting. I am a\u000ahuge Tim Robbins fan and Morgan Freeman does a superb job as "the man\u000awho can get things". The majority of the supporting cast were just as\u000agood. The storyline is honest and fun. I believe most people will enjoy\u000awhat this film has to offer. If you think you might be turned off\u000abecause this is a prison movie please reconsider. I doubt that once\u000ayou've seen the movie you will consider it a cliché prison flick. Most\u000amovies today are entirely too predictable. This movie is guaranteed to\u000asurprise and excite as the plot and ending unfold.\u000a

V\u000aIf this movie isn't a masterpiece, then nothing is.

Tim Robbins is\u000aexcellent for the part of Andy Dufresne and Morgan Freeman couldn't\u000ahave been a better choice for the speaker and the role itself.Even though the movie is full of surprises it allows you to figure out\u000aa few things yourself every now and then. But in the long run it\u000aconsists of many unbelievable twists and turns and there's just not one\u000aboring second. I'm not surprised about the rating either, this movie\u000ajust deserves to be as high up on all lists as a movie possibly can be.\u000aIf you haven't seen it, you know what I want you to do next.\u000a

V\u000aMany of the most powerful stories are the soulful ones that teach us\u000anot to despair, not to be swamped by sorrow. They remind us that hope\u000ais a precious and buoyant emotion which can give our lives substance\u000aand meaning.The Shawshank Redemption is based on a novella by Stephen King. Tim\u000aRobbins plays Andy, a banker who is sent to prison for the murder of\u000ahis wife and her lover. The judge who sentences him finds him "a\u000aparticularly remorseless and icy man." Andy's cool reserve and\u000aaloofness is not accepted well by the other inmates at Shawshank\u000amaximum-security prison in Maine. He is raped by some angry men and\u000agiven several long stretches in solitary confinement for his bad\u000aattitude.Luckily, Andy is befriended by Red, played by Morgan Freeman, the\u000aprison fixer. He is awed by this young man's quiet reserve and inward\u000aresolve to make the best of his bad situation. Andy's accounting skills\u000acome in handy, and he begins doing the taxes for the guards and\u000alaundering money for the corrupt warden. This lands him the cushy job\u000aof librarian. Eventually, Andy wrangles money out of state officials to\u000abuild the best prison library anywhere.Writer and director Frank Darabont draws out strong and intense\u000aperformances from Morgan Freeman and Tim Robbins as soulmates who\u000asupport each other while doing hard time. Red sees hope as a dangerous\u000athing that can drive a man insane, but Andy believes it is fuel that\u000akeeps one going against all odds. The Shawshank Redemption is a\u000ajubilant tribute to hope as an essential quality of soul.\u000a

V\u000aThe Shawshank Redemption (based on the short story "Rita Hayworth & the\u000aShawshank Redemption" by Stephen King) is quite possibly one of the\u000agreatest movies ever to grace the big screen.Set in the mid-1900's, "The Shawshank Redemption" is tale of Andy\u000aDufrasne (played by Tim Robbins), a man recently convicted of a double\u000ahomicide and sentenced to life in Shawshank Prison. Once there, he\u000ameets "Red" (Morgan Freeman), a fellow inmate at the facility who is\u000aserving his own sentence, and who tells Dufrasne's story as narrator\u000athrough his own eyes. The two eventually form a close friendship as\u000athey serve out their terms, and yet deal with their circumstances in\u000adifferent ways.As the story goes on, the audience is treated to a culture and\u000alifestyle that few have ever experienced, or probably even thought\u000aabout. The movie goes into detail the dark side of the prison world,\u000aincluding corrupt guards, violence between the inmates, and even worse\u000aissues, but also shows some of the bright spots which seem to make the\u000adreary existence of the prisoners tolerable.The acting in this film is fantastic. Both Robbins and Freeman do\u000amagnificent jobs in their respected roles, and the inclusion of Freeman\u000anarration of the story adds a touch of credibility, as though this tale\u000amay actually be true. The movie engages the audience from beginning to\u000aend with the perfect blend of humor, sorrow, and even suspense. One\u000amoment a viewer will find themselves chuckling at a joke between the\u000ainmates, and the next cringing at the unsettling events unfolding\u000abefore their eyes.Overall, a magnificent cinematic masterpiece, and a must see for any\u000aserious movie buff.\u000a

V\u000aShawshank is among the very finest of movies I've ever seen, because it\u000atouches me personally as no other film has ever done. Andy Dufresne's\u000aanguish over his circumstance is so close to my own, it's as though he\u000awere telling MY story, not reading from a fictitious script. Especially\u000amoving is the scene, sitting with Red, he tells how, no, he didn't kill\u000ahis wife, etc., etc., and the remainder of the ensuing conversation,\u000aand his decision to "Get busy living, or get busy dying" is as close to\u000amy heart and soul as any screen dialog I've ever heard. No, I didn't\u000akill my ex-wife,(she's still alive and well), but my personal anguish\u000aover the circumstances and travails I've endured through the years, are\u000atruly mine, to the nth degree. If I were to write a script of my own\u000alife, the script of Shawshank would be mine! As for inconsistencies in\u000athe story, however, the one glaring defect so obvious is that no\u000afacility in the world keeps the same man in the same cell for 20+ years\u000awithout change, or even the normal shakedown inspections. How Andy\u000amanaged to cut a hole through the wall behind the poster without being\u000adiscovered is absolutely ridiculous, it just doesn't happen! Morgan\u000aFreeman's sonorous voice narration simply adds to the warmth and beauty\u000aof the storyline, so heartfelt and true-to-character, it brings tears\u000ato the eyes. Yes, Shawshank is among the best ever, Thank You, one and\u000aall!\u000a

V\u000aThis was, put simply, the longest film I've ever seen. I've spent many\u000aan hour watching movies. Some of them were good. Some of them were bad.\u000aSome of them reached me so deep inside that I spent days afterward\u000athinking about them. But the experience, watching the film itself,\u000aalways lasted between one to four hours.With "The Shawshank Redemption," the experience lasted twenty years.I wasn't bored. At first, I was skeptical about this film. Some movies\u000awhich ranked high in the IMDb weren't worthy; for example, "Batman\u000aBegins." My skepticism was so strong that it prevented me from entering\u000athe film with awe. But after a while, I found myself completely\u000aimmersed in Red's narrative.It is useless to try and explain the experience of watching this film.\u000aBut I can say one thing more.This film was the first film that brought tears of joy to my eyes. I\u000aended up smiling and then chuckling. And then I felt a streak of water\u000arun down my cheek. And I realized I just experienced the ultimate\u000amovie: the life story of people I wouldn't have known other wise, and\u000aas real and as good as it gets.\u000a

V\u000aI had nothing to do the other night so I thought - hey, I feel like\u000awatching a good (and boy did I mean GOOD) movie. So I browsed the IMDb\u000ato see what I could find. 'The Shawshank Redemption' was one of only\u000atwo movies which had more than 9/10 on average. I decided to watch this\u000a2 hour long piece of work.The audience is brought in to the movie at once, something which I\u000areally appreciate in movies. In 'The Shawshank Redemption' you will\u000afollow Andy who was convicted for the murderer of his wife and her\u000alover. It appears that Andy is innocent so in jail (named Shawshank) a\u000astruggle to become free again is started.'The Shawshank Redemption' is deep, funny and very smart. It brings up\u000amany messages about hope, friendship and fear. I strongly recommend you\u000adevote 2 hours of your life for this movie.9 out 10.\u000a

V\u000aPossibly the best role Tim Robbins ever took on, that of quiet and\u000amild-mannered Andy Dufresne, a convict wrongly imprisoned for the\u000amurder of his wife and her lover.In this situation, he meets "Red," played wonderfully by Morgan\u000aFreeman, as well as all his friends including Heywood, Floyd, and\u000aBrooks, played by James Whitmore. Through the narration of Red we see\u000athe changes in Andy as he builds a huge library, helps young Tommy earn\u000ahis High School Diploma, gets the cons some beer from one of the\u000a"meanest screws to ever walk a turn at Shawshank," played again by\u000aClancy Brown, one of the greatest living actors in film today. Through\u000ait all Andy also endures torture of a different sort from Warden\u000aNorton, a role of villainy played brilliantly as Robbins character by\u000aBob Gunton. We see Andy as he goes from doing the tax returns to\u000aactually laundering the Warden's money. One of the most endearing\u000alines: "Outside, I was an honest man, straight as an arrow. I had to\u000acome to prison to learn to be a crook." This movie is as good as the\u000aGreen Mile, if not better. And that's hard to do. From it we see hope\u000ain the eyes of the hopeless as Andy's actions give that to them. I give\u000ait a 10 out of 10, got out and get it today. I promise you'll love it.\u000a

V\u000aThere is a scene early in the movie when the viewer is introduced for\u000athe first time to Shawshank prison. The camera takes us on an\u000aextraordinary panorama, beginning at ground level and rising up until\u000awe see the inmates crowding around like ants. It must have been shot\u000awith a sky-crane or something because there is no break in continuity.\u000aThe view just goes on, up and around in a breathtaking cycle. The\u000aeffect is reminiscent of the 360 degree battlefield panorama of Rod\u000aStieger's Napoleon in 'Waterloo'. It is almost arrogant, except that\u000ait's wonderful. From this point on, I knew I was about to watch\u000asomething very, very special.The film depicts the institutional brutality that sadly continues to be\u000athe hallmark or imprisonment, and how one comes to terms with it, or\u000anot. We quickly discover what happens to those who don't. Some\u000ahysterical white-collar inmate cracks-up and is beaten to death on his\u000afirst night. It is a monstrous example of the ironically named\u000a'correctional facility' at work.Morgan Freeman is another actor as remarkable for his voice as his\u000aother abilities. He is perfectly chosen as narrator.For almost 2 hours we endure the gloomy, threatening claustrophobia\u000athat makes up much of prison time, and what inmates do to gain some\u000alittle respect and make life endurable. In this regard it has a lot in\u000acommon with 'Midnight Express'. Except that here we are dealing with an\u000ainnocent man.Music scores are perfectly chosen. The sound effects equally well\u000amatched. The viewer is taken upon a journey so complete and plausible -\u000aassisted by strong acting and excellent script - that when the\u000aextremely unlikely escape is discovered, we are left believing that\u000atoo.The idea that a thunderstorm should fortuitously arrive at the very\u000ahour of need to mask the sounds of hammering, and that it would be\u000apossible to find sufficient air in the enclosed sewer-pipe, both\u000astretch our credence a little.My favourite moment features the abscondment-on-parole of Red, who goes\u000ain search of a certain Field with a certain tree. After so long steeped\u000ain the dank, evil reek of prison one can almost smell the scents of\u000asummer, the mown hay. All is silent except for the whir of insects and\u000adistant birdsong as soft sunlight filters down through trees. The\u000acontrast is perfect, the ambiance tangible. These are surely the things\u000ato savour most when freed from permanent brutality.This, and the movie 'Fried Greeen Tomatoes' seem to perfectly\u000acounterpoint each other. They are both of equal quality and address\u000aparallels of endurance and relationships from male or female\u000aperspectives. I love 'em both as much.I'm told that each bombed at the box-office. Not enough pyrotechnics\u000aand CGI effects I guess.If you haven't seen either of them; get busy. But watch them on a\u000adecent telly with a quality independent sound-system.\u000a

V\u000aI was made to watch this film in my English class for doing coursework.\u000aI am sooo happy my teacher set me that work. A class of 30 teenagers\u000awalked way from the lessons we watched it in so influenced by the film\u000aheading to the shop to by their own copy. I am proud to say I was one\u000aof them. Once I got to uni and found out some people hadn't watched it\u000aI sat them down at night and forced them. Sadly watching it in a\u000akitchen shared by 16 people even at night isn't the quietest place to\u000awatch this film. Half drunk student would walk in and all my friends\u000awho hadn't seen it turned to them and before they had chance to speak\u000athey were told to shut up so they could watch it in peace. I was happy\u000ato see my friends having the same reaction I had to the film. It is\u000aproof that a film doesn't need special affects to hook a bunch of young\u000apeople onto it. It needs something and what ever it is the Shawshank\u000aRedemption has it by the bucket full. I am afraid to say I still have\u000afriends who haven't watched it but I will continue to try and get them\u000ato watch it and I hope you take up this fight, if you haven't watched\u000ait, watch it, if you have, make more people watch it.\u000a

V\u000aSo far and by far the greatest movie ever made. It has been greatly\u000aovershadowed by its 1994 Oscar opponent "Forrest Gump" (Which was no\u000awhere near as a good a movie as "Shawshank") It took a decade after\u000a"Shawshank" for Morgan Freeman and Tim Robbins to receive Oscars and\u000aFrank Darabont should have won Best Director (let alone been nominated\u000afor it). It is a movie that overpowers, yet under-achieves "Forrest\u000aGump." It is only right to deem it the most innovative and inspiring\u000amovie of all time. The phenomenal story is powered by outstanding\u000aacting and epic direction, as well as a dramatic score. It is not only\u000aa model for all dramas, but a masterpiece that never tires, will never\u000abe outdone, and will never bring hope to those who watch it.\u000a

We see him first come to grips with the way his\u000alife is, then we see him begin to see how he could change it for the\u000abetter.It is full of memorable characters who each have something to share\u000awith us if we are willing to listen.

V\u000aWOW what a great way to spend two hours on your backside - This is one\u000aof the greatest films ever made. I love all of it, Tim Robbins acting\u000afighting the skinheads, teaching the inmates, helping with the guards\u000afinances, and digging the tunnel a wonderfully written part and a self\u000acrafted bit genius from Morgan Freeman made this film sparkle! GREAT\u000aFILM! please watch it... I think the prison warden looks like Graham\u000a'turinp' Taylor the ex England Soccer Manager! funny - I love the shoes\u000ajoke at the end very good. It did remind me a little of other films\u000awhen Morgan Freeman leaves prison. But Tim on his boat at the very end\u000ais a smile raiser!\u000a

V\u000aThis movie does an excellent job of portraying all characters in this\u000amovie and showing how each individual deals with the fact/probability\u000athat they might never see life outside of prison walls, while also\u000ashowing how certain inmates manage to handle freedom once being let out\u000aof prison. A truly inspirational movie showing the strength of hope and\u000awillpower while not being too extremely over the top and using an\u000aending to make all viewers feel good about how everything resolves\u000aitself and lets viewers have the entire story come full circle with a\u000atrue sense of irony at the very end. An awesome film that is well\u000adirected with an excellent "mood" surrounding the entire movie. The\u000aacting keeps right up with and for the most part exceeds the directing.\u000a

V\u000aCaptivating, Uplififting and Important are three adjectives most\u000aappropriate for this picture. Captivating as this film did literally\u000ahold me captive under Morgan Freeman's spellbinding narration in\u000aaddition to his sublime acting from Freeman, Tim Robbins and the\u000asupporting cast. Uplifting as this film truly made hope spring eternal\u000aand has done for film-lovers across the globe. Finally this picture is\u000aimportant as there are many people in this world who have given up\u000ahope, are denigrated and dejected and may even feel that there life has\u000ano purpose but this film has renewed life to many people. It tells the\u000astory of Andy Dufresne(Robbins) who is convicted of murdering his wife\u000aand sent to Shawshank Prison for life and forms an unlikely friendship\u000aand bond with Red(Freeman) and his gang, who initially reject him,\u000athat's all I'll prefer to tell you of the film to maximise it's impact.\u000a

All of the\u000acharacters in this film were endlessly interesting, textured and rich.\u000aI think everyone in this cast deserved an award. This film continues to\u000ahaunt me (in the very best way). I watch this film several times a\u000ayear, and never cease to be amazed by all of the performances.

V\u000aThis movie has made my top 5 list. I heard people talk about this movie\u000aincluding my parents. All I ever heard was good reviews, but just\u000awatched it for my first time just under a year ago.About a week ago I bought it and love watching it. I watched it twice\u000ain a week and want to watch it again. The movie was put together really\u000agreat. It has a good plot and a lot of unexpected things happen. If you\u000alike "The Green Mile", you will love this movie. If you like prison\u000amovies you will love this movie. If you like action, drama, love, and\u000aany other kind of movie you will love The Shawshank Redemption.The actors are great in the movie and it was well directed. There are\u000aseveral moments in the movie that are very moving, even for the Macho\u000aMen :-P If you want to watch a great movie watch the (in my opinion) #1\u000abest movie of all time. The Shawshank Redemption.Oh and like a read on a post on the message board, it has the best\u000aclosing line ever.\u000a

V\u000aThis movie should have won all the Oscars in 1994 (Forrest Gump won)\u000abut we all believe The Shawshank Redemption deserved better. Tim\u000aRobbins played the meticulous character like no one could have. The\u000astory has a catch (the escape) but it's not about the escape. It's\u000aabout hope. Morgan Freeman is a tremendous supporting actor, although I\u000abelieve his role was no less important.The movie's first part is confusing until you get to the middle of the\u000amovie. During the entire first half you sit wondering what's the point\u000aof all this. Yet you are glued because you hope there is something. By\u000athe time movie enters second part you feel 'man i should have been in\u000athat prison' There is no villain in the movie, everyone's just a\u000acharacter. It's no good boys winning over bad boys. But yet at the end\u000aof the movie you feel triumphant. Many people don't know about this movie because of the nature of the\u000astory. But then those who know, know too well. No wonder this movie is\u000atop rated at IMDb, that is a good enough compliment to the director,\u000ascript and the actors. Oscar isn't the end of the world.\u000a

V\u000ai think this film is a superb film because it's really heart warming\u000aand tearful. Also the film is good because it tells you what prisons\u000awere like in 1947 the scene i like the most is the end because the way\u000ahe broke out of prison with the hammer and stone and when he escaped\u000athrough a tunnel of filth. it was good because he kept it secret by\u000acovering the hole with the poster.When the warden walks in and looks at\u000athe bible and the hammer shape is in the book at it says salvation will\u000aset you free. The scene where brooks hung him self because he didn't\u000alike the outside world. It was also sad when tommy got shot because he\u000aknew who killed the bankers wife and lover.\u000a

V\u000aExcellent movie! I've seen it for several times but I can't stop\u000awatching it. It's memorable! The actors play is magnificent! Hope is\u000awhat we need most! Redemption is just a word like every other word. In\u000aa corrupt system, hope never dies. Andy is not only just a smart guy.\u000aHe takes advantage of the whole corrupt system. There were and there\u000awill always exist innocent people in jail. How you can prove your\u000ainnocence is a matter of common sense which is not evenly distributed.\u000aHope is always needed as long as corruption never end. When hope dies,\u000aeverything else dies slowly. And in the end a question: what would one\u000alike Andy do not in 1966, but in 2006. Could he still get into prison,\u000acould he still escape, could he still take financial advantage over the\u000asystem? I hope he could!\u000a

V\u000aThe Shawskank Redemption is a movie of immense talent, looking into the\u000adeepest feelings of prison, and surviving it. It all starts when Andy\u000aDufresne, a successful banker and a geologist hopeful, (Tim Collins) is\u000awrongly accused of his wife's and her lover's murder, sent to prison,\u000aand makes new relationships and learns to deal with prison, along the\u000away meeting someone in particular, Ellis Boyd 'Red' Redding (Morgan\u000aFreeman). Ends hopefully, not with that much of a cliffhanger but still\u000amuch room for good to happen, not too much for bad, and definitely one\u000aof my all-time favorite movies. A good look at the troubles, realities,\u000aand heartbreaks of prison. Good quotes on hope.\u000a

V\u000aI voted a 10 (excellent). WOOOOOOO!!!!!!! It was intense, sad,\u000adramatic, funny, and heartwarming all at the same time. I love history,\u000aso this story brought what i knew to life. It led me to question many\u000athings about life's trials and tribulations and the strength it takes\u000ato overcome any struggle. Morgan Freeman is one of my favorite actors\u000aand his narration of the film is truly special. His role of Red is one\u000athat demonstrates true character adaptation to real life scenarios and\u000aexperiences. It is one that will be remembered for a lifetime. Tim\u000aRobbins takes the reality of prison life and demonstrates a new side to\u000alife in there, one that is different from many others. His heart and\u000asoul change over the course of the film, and it it truly exciting to\u000asee this adaptation. I LOVED it, and so should you.\u000a

V\u000aA big part of this film's appeal is the interplay between Thomas\u000aNewman's soundtrack and the simple yet profound dialog. The CD score\u000astands up as a great work on its own. It alternates between brooding\u000apiano and powerful orchestration, with a few oldies added for context.Three scenes, named by corresponding tracks, are especially poignant.\u000aThe first is "Brooks Was Here," followed by "Zihuatanejo" and "So Was\u000aRed" (that title carries over from the Brooks track). To me, the third\u000ais among the most moving sequences in film history. You can't top\u000aMorgan Freeman saying "Get busy livin'..." as the inspiring music plays\u000ain the background.\u000a

V\u000aI was forced to give this movie a rating of 10. Because this movie is a\u000alesson on how life itself is, it deserves much more.The last comment poster asked who the reader's "Andy" was. I ask that\u000aposter who his "Red" is :). A little cheeky, but an important question, because Andy always needs\u000aRed to survive and make meaning of what is around them, of what is\u000atheir life. Andy is a viewer in some respects, picking up and learning\u000aand teaching in a nonchalant manner.I also believe, perhaps, Andy and Red often exist in the one and same\u000aperson.\u000a

I won't say anything new, everybody\u000ahas already said everything about how amazing this movie is. I own it\u000aon VHS in Spanish and English and I have it on DVD now.

V\u000aShawshank Redemption along with Casablanca, Citizen Kane, Star Wars,\u000aGoodfellas, and the Godfather are worth every amount you spend. Even\u000athough this movie isn't at all like the Stephen King novel "Rita\u000aHayworth and Shawshank Redemption", this movie has done some amazing\u000achanges with comparisons to the novel and ultimately, I thought the\u000afilm was better than the novel itself. I was blown away by the\u000astoryline, especially when Morgan Freeman was narrating. However, it\u000awas a disappointment that the film never won any of seven academy award\u000anominations. If you are looking for a film to watch: one that has an\u000aamazing script you hardly see in today's films, one that has some great\u000aactors, and one that shows a strong bonding of friendship... this is\u000athe one to see! I give this film a 10 out of 10 because it was\u000aworthwhile watching and was worth every penny I spent on the 10th\u000aanniversary DVD.\u000a

V\u000aIt's my personal favorite. A man discovers himself after he is\u000asentenced to life in prison, and can escape and move to Zihuatanejo,\u000ahis greatest dream. It's something that represents the human condition of looking for what\u000ayou want, but quiet few can achieve their goals as Andy Dufresne did\u000awith patience and courage.The rhythm of the movie is slow and subtle, as a fairy tale but with\u000athe harshness of reality.You can watch it over and over again and keep enjoying the ride...it's\u000aa classic and classics prevail!\u000a

What better place then a prison to forge the\u000afriendships that will last a lifetime. Steven King, for a horror\u000awriter, writes some of the human dramas out there. I can't believe this\u000ais not the number one movie. The Godfather was good yes, but it falls\u000ashort of this film. If you haven't seen this movie, what the hell is\u000awrong with you?

V\u000aThis is one of the most under-rated (by the so-called experts) films of\u000aall time.There are no weak links in the cast. Direction and filming are of\u000aclassical quality; and the performances of Tim Robbins and Morgan\u000aFreeman are virtually flawless. The fact that neither of them received\u000aeither Best Actor, or Best Supporting actor is, to me, totally\u000aincomprehensible. Having said that, I personally would have trouble in\u000aassigning which award to which actor. When I see the dross that receive\u000aOscars, I find it totally unreal that Morgan Freeman has, to date\u000a(December 2005), received only one supporting actor award - shame on\u000athe Academy.The storyline/plot is fairly standard and competent. All along you get\u000athe feeling that Andy (Tim Robbins), and Red (Morgan Freeman) will get\u000asomething out of the whole affair, but the final twist in the\u000aentrapment of the prison governor is quite original.The Shawshank redemption was worthy of a minimum of three Oscars, and\u000athe fact that it received none is one of the greatest ever shames\u000aattributable to The Acadamy and its members.\u000a

V\u000aLike most people I saw this movie (a) on the advice of a friend (b) on\u000avideo. I knew very little about it, but was told "it's awesome".The movie is built around Andy (Robbins) a real innocent man, sent to\u000aprison for the alleged murder of his wife and lover. He finds the going\u000atough in prison ie the food is bad, his cell awful, sodomy, but he soon\u000alearns what it takes to survive. Just when you think "oh please don't'\u000aturn into Tom Selleck's 'An Innocent Man'", you are thrilled to see the\u000amovie take another direction. Some acts of kindness win some of the\u000ainmates over and he soon finds a close ally in Red (Freeman). Andy goes\u000aabout making a difference in prison and instilling hope into the lives\u000aof his friends. I won't go much further but it's fair to say I've never\u000amet someone who has seen this and not been impacted. This movie is what\u000aHollywood should be about- and it was originally written by Stephen\u000aKing! Get the Special Edition DVD for some excellent bonus features,\u000amost notably a parody that is extremely clever.\u000a

Scenes of brutal violence in the prison have the intended\u000aeffect on the audience without being too gory.One of the few movies that have driven home the power of hope so\u000aeffectively, this is one movie that will lift your spirits in times of\u000agloom.\u000a

V\u000aOf all the movies I have ever seen in my lifetime, this ranks up there\u000awith the few and the proud of the most awesome movies you'd gladly\u000awatch over and over. It is truly a masterpiece. Pity it didn't beat\u000aForrest Gump as picture of the year in 1994 (a good movie in its own\u000amerit) as Shawshank, to me, was much more of an enthralling film and\u000adeserving of the title.One of the best choices in this film was to have Morgan Freeman (Red)\u000aas the narrator. Morgan has a voice and a way of telling a story that\u000apulls you right into it. He does the same in the more recent film March\u000aOf The Penguins, which is also another good film.Another good thing about Shawshank is that when you come to the\u000a"stunning" ending they don't just drop you right there, they still\u000aspend a good 15 - 20 minutes developing the end of the story. That's\u000asomething I so wish wish they would do with more films nowadays.If you haven't seen The Shawshank Redemption (based on the short story\u000aby Stephen King called Rita Hayworth and The Shawshank Redemption),\u000awhat are you waiting for? ;)\u000a

V\u000aIt's hard to imagine that maybe the most uplifting film of all time is\u000aset inside the walls of a prison but that is the case in The Shawshank\u000aRedemption. The film is about friendship, loyalty, and patience which\u000amay not seem like the most intriguing elements until you have seen them\u000abrought together in this film. Opening with the incarceration of Andy\u000aDufresne (Tim Robbins) for two life terms for the brutal killing of his\u000awife and her lover the film seems to be heading into dark territory.\u000aInstead what we get is an examination of the triumph of human spirit. Shawshank Prison is the meanest prison around, or so says\u000aEllis"Red"Redding(Morgan Freeman) in an early narration. This is where\u000aRed and Andy first meet and where the development of one of the most\u000arewarding screen friendships begins. Tim Robbins who plays Andy gives\u000ahis best performance. He carries himself in a manner unimaginable\u000aconsidering his predicament. His patience and strength are a marvel.\u000aMorgan Freeman turns in the performance of his career as Red who\u000anarrates the film as well as provide the realism that Andy has\u000asuppressed back. Andy is a patient man who walks the yard of Shawshank\u000alike he doesn't have a care in the world. The film's success lies in\u000athe relationship between Andy and Red. Their friendship carries them\u000athrough the struggles of the prison term and us through the film. One\u000aof the most memorable endings in film history comes from their life\u000along bond. I am being vague on details because I do not want to spoil\u000athe film for anyone who has not seen it. As far as I am concerned it is\u000asomething that you should do immediately. The Shawshank Redemption does\u000aso much well. But above all it is a story of hope. The ability to\u000apersevere through any situation is the hallmark of this remarkable\u000afilm.\u000a

All my favourite films have that quality, seven, six sense and\u000athe game. Its just a shame that over the past few years there hasn't\u000abeen any films which i can honestly add to that list. So come on\u000aHollywood give us proper gutrenching twists not big grizzly apes!!!!\u000a

V\u000aI'm just wondering or if we get told in some way if the letter that\u000aAndy had sent to the newspaper from the bank had any information about\u000ahis innocents in the murders of his wife and her lover. This is because\u000aCapatin Hadley was arrested outside the prison and the only way that I\u000acould see this happen is if Andy had sent some information in that\u000aletter to the paper.I'm also just wondering if Norton had any sort of information about\u000aAndy's innocents. I haven't read the book "Rita Heyworth and the\u000aShawshank Redemption" which is roughly based on the movie. It would be\u000anice if I could get a reply from someone who has an answer too one of\u000athese questions.\u000a

V\u000aI remember the first time I watched this movie. I was only 10 and i had\u000aturned on the TV to watch and i saw this movie called the Shoshana\u000aredemption and i thought what a interesting name. But the movie\u000awouldn't have been excellent without the awesome casting of Tim\u000aRobbins(Andy), Morgan Freeman (Red), Bob Gunton (Warden Norton), James\u000aHandy (Brooks) and Clancy Brown (Captain Byron Hadley). The movie\u000aconveys lots of mixed messages but the most important to me is that\u000aeven though we can be in dark and scary places there can always be\u000alight. Only fault that as the years went by, Morgan Freeman didn't look\u000ahis age. Other then that it was a good movie with a good message that\u000ayou keep watching over and over again.\u000a

V\u000aIt is hard to believe Stephen King could create such a movie! I know he\u000adoes a lot of horror movies, but I never knew he was capable of such\u000adrama.Shawshank Redemption is narrated by Morgan Freeman (as always) and is\u000aabout when Andy is sent to prison for life after being framed for his\u000awife's murder. He becomes an inspiration as he talks about hope\u000athroughout the film. That's where the film's power lies. The speeches\u000aabout hope and freedom in a dark and cold prison are moving. Other\u000ascenes have don't have inspirational dialouge. Instead, they rely on\u000aactions, acting and music. All of these create some mood that is felt\u000aby the viewer.I did have my expectations, and the film didn't live up to them, but\u000athe film is undeniably good! I don't think it's the second best film of\u000aall time, but still it makes my top 20 list. At first, I was\u000adisappointed. But, I had to eventually give into the power of\u000a"Shawshank Redemption." It's still hard to believe Stephen King did\u000athis. 8.5/10\u000a

V\u000aI love this movie for many reasons. The acting doesn't get any better.\u000aOne gets easily pulled into the stories and characters with no\u000ahesitation. When a story can effortlessly make you care about the\u000asituations and troubles it presents, it deserves praise. This movie may\u000anot have a revolutionary plot, but it it still everything a good movie\u000ashould be. One may think the ending is too "touchy feely" but i think\u000ait adds to the overall appeal ,remember it's not called the "Shawshank\u000aDamnation". See it and enjoy and remember, it's OK to to cry over happy\u000athings too!Final Analysis: I will watch this movie many more times before I die\u000a

V\u000aAn eternal movie.. The outstanding acting by Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman in additions\u000ato the well written scenario create something more than a film..\u000aSomething unique! While you attend the movie you enter slowly in the world of Shawshank\u000aPrison. 'Hope' in this movie means not just a feeling but an escape\u000afrom misery . The desire to be free connected his intelligence and his\u000agreat knowledge of economics make Andy do things extraordinary that\u000aothers were afraid or couldn't do . Andy Dufresne was already a living\u000amyth in the prison but that was not what he wanted, he was determined\u000ato make his dreams come true!At the end of the movie with the unexpected escape of Andy, you can't\u000ado anything less but to bow in front of this unique conception...\u000a

V\u000aStill ranked #2 on IMDb:s top 250-list, this is not one of those epic\u000amasterpieces like resident #1 "The Godfather". Rather this is a small\u000aand quite low-key film that brings up some of the biggest concepts in\u000alife. And that it certainly speaks to people can be seen from the grade\u000aif nothing else.I had watched this movie a few years ago, and i didn't really\u000aunderstand then what all the fuss was about. I enjoyed it, surely, but\u000anot in the way that other people seemed to. But having recently watched\u000ait again i must say that the message finally drove home. For several\u000areasons this is an amazing film.First of all the concepts it touches. Justice, fairness, endurance,\u000ahope and of course above all friendship. Seldom have i seen a movie so\u000afilled with emotion and still it's not weighted down by it. The movie\u000ais one of the few i have seen where all this emotion truly feels\u000ajustified. Not least because of the second reason why this is an\u000aamazing movie: the actors. Tim Robbins is one of my personal favorites,\u000aan amazing actor to say the least. He almost never fails to deliver and\u000ahere he is mesmerizing. Morgan Freeman is another stable and dependable\u000aactor, but i don't think he has ever been as good as he is here. And\u000athey are supported by a very well balanced and well chosen supporting\u000acast. Finally Frank Darabonts directing is done with the lightest touch\u000aand an amazing attention to detail. He never lets things slide out of\u000ahand as they often do when strong emotions are present.While i find this to be an amazing film the high average score here at\u000aIMDb still surprises me somewhat. It's a great movie, but it's not the\u000akind of movie i expected so many people would consider great. But maybe\u000ait's just because what we have here is a movie about the greatest thing\u000alife has to offer; friendship. And an unlikely friendship at that,\u000asimple to understand and simple to appreciate. This is a feel-good\u000amovie in the best way imaginable - one where you must first pass\u000athrough fire before you reach redemption.9/10\u000a

V\u000aThis movie is about hope. Sort of like "Here comes the sun" by the\u000aBeatles. However, unlike George Harrison's sweet melody this film has a\u000adark grit that makes it palatable and relevant to the life of any\u000astruggling person. Andy Dufresne is an innocent man convicted to life\u000ain the awful Shawshank prison. He perseveres and, in the end, he is\u000asaved though what is meant by saved you will have to see by watching\u000athe movie. The Shawshank prison is a powerful metaphor for human\u000astruggles and limitations. And, in the end, what can any of us do\u000abesides persevering in good works? Andy Dufresne shows that this\u000aperseverance has value and ultimately triumphs over despair.\u000a

V\u000aI saw this film, and from the moment i started watching. To the moment\u000ai stopped i was dazzled and amazed by the extremely great performances\u000aby Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman and its storyline which is either sad\u000atense unnerving or very funny. The film contains many wonderful or\u000adangerous characters and holds a few violent scenes of brutal beatings\u000aand harrowing views of prison life. The film lives up to its name and\u000awell deserves the awards given to it and is a film and can be viewed\u000aover and over again without any of the films dazzling magic wearing\u000aoff. One of my favourite movies of all time, although i think number 2\u000ain the top 250 is a bit extreme, i still thing it well deserves a good\u000aplace at number 5 at least. For any movie lover this film should almost definitely satisfy you and\u000awill show you that it is worth all the hype.\u000a

V\u000aIt's a good movie when you watch it, you enjoy it and I would watch it\u000aagain. But when you think about it, it all sorts of crumbles. Why\u000adidn't Andy have a lawyer to contact? Why were none of the characters\u000adeveloped? And, finally: WHY IS IT CALLED A REDEMPTION IF ANDY IS\u000aINNOCENT? It redeems no one! Andy doesn't need redemption, Red doesn't\u000aeither (he already is remorseful for his crime.) Why were they afraid\u000ato make Andy guilty? It would have been more believable, MUCH more\u000aplausible, and then it actually would have been a redemption! If you\u000awant a true story of redemption, read "Les Miserables." And, guess\u000awhat, Hugo had enough talent to not need a fundamentalist Christian\u000awarden with a freaking southern accent.Also, the ending should have cut off much earlier than it did. Maybe "I\u000awant to see my friend again." That would have left us wondering, did he\u000amake it? I hope he did! Instead, we actually see the stupid scene. Ugh.The most beautiful scene of this is the Sull'aria scene... but let's\u000aface it, what director could make a scene with Mozart playing in it\u000augly? Except for Joel Schumacher, I suppose.\u000a

V\u000aI've seen this movie about 7 times now and every time i still get the\u000ashivers that i had the first time watching it.This movie is absolute my\u000anr.1 movie by far and is not just a film but also leaves a vision on\u000alife and to appreciate a good friendship in the deepest meaning. The\u000aquotes given in the film are typical and makes you think of how you\u000ashould live your life. It made me think about stuff.the movie touched\u000ame in such a way that i thought of certain attributes in life suddenly\u000amore beautiful.If i ever need to be reminded or have a wake up call, i\u000aplay the shawshank redemption.

V\u000aThis is by far the most underrated movie ever made. The movie itself is\u000ajust so well done that I don't ever get tired of seeing it. I found out\u000aabout it 2 years after it came out and since then it's made an\u000aimpression on me that affects me even to this day. The movie is\u000abrilliance and it's done so well that it upsets me to know that it\u000adidn't do as well as it should have in the box office. But it's a\u000asimilar thing that paralleled The Wizard of Oz and Gone with The Wind\u000ain 1939 it did it again in 1994 with The Shawshank Redemption and\u000aForrest Gump. This movie though as whole is one of the best films put together that\u000ashows morale code, fear and hope. It shows what can be taken from us,\u000afrom freedom or someone (Tommy getting killed) from any situation that\u000awas put together but hope stays with us and cant be beaten or stolen\u000afrom us unless we let it and this movie shows us that in an honest way\u000athat isn't exaggerated. To me I'll never get tired of seeing this movie\u000anor get tired of what it means. Hope.\u000a

V\u000aI'd be lying to you if I told you that when Andy brakes out of his cell\u000aand crawls to freedom, I wasn't just as happy as the masses of people\u000athat call this their all time favorite move. And to say that I wasn't\u000ariveted when he is locked i the office and turns up the music while\u000abeing threatened by the guards would also be untrue. But at the same\u000atime, this movie is most certainly not the second best film ever\u000abecause of one simple reason: It can't decide if it wants to be real\u000awith occasional hints of hope or imaginative and dreamy. It drags you\u000aalong for two hours of hard depressing facts and victory only in the\u000amost modest portions, then, for whatever reason, has a Hollywood ending\u000aof him digging through the wall then picking up the bank account that\u000athere's no way in hell that he'd be able to get in real life. This is\u000agreat entertainment and I give it a ton of credit for having the\u000aability to maintain my attention the whole time. But at the same time,\u000athe ending proved a little disappointing because it betrayed everything\u000athat this movie was trying to be.\u000a

V\u000aYears ago i heard about this film and now i have watched it. Its lines\u000amake me think a lot. Andy was a silent man. However there is an\u000aambitious goal in his mind. That is the hope. He said hope is a good\u000athing while Red said it was a dangerous thing. Because of the big hope\u000aAndy was busy for it everyday."Get busy living, or get busy dying" ,\u000awhich is his word. it reminds me the saying of a famous Chinese writer\u000aLu Sun. That is ¡°break out in silence or perdition in silence¡±. What\u000ado you think about it? When i think over this word 'hope' i strongly\u000afeel that it is a guider in my lifetime. Without a hope I don't know\u000awhat I am doing everyday. With a hope everyday is meaningful.And it is\u000anot a waste of time.Certainly there is a strong mind in Andy's heart insists him to do what\u000ahe was doing. If hope is the first thing , insisting will be the second\u000athing.No matter how hard it is, we shall not give up our hope while we\u000aare approaching it. Andy is the bird with beautiful feathers and it is\u000aa sin to forbid him in prison. His escaping is predetermined. Miracle\u000ais coming true by Andy¡¯s Rock-hammer. Our dreams are also coming true\u000aby our hands.In the film, talking between Andy and Red and Red¡¯s monologue\u000adescribed vivid interpersonal activity. And this peaceful talking may\u000astimulate readers¡¯ inner billows better than exciting dialogue.\u000aAndy¡¯s guilt to his wife has been released and got redemption after\u000alocking in Shaw shank prison for nigh teen years. The heaviest burden\u000aof a person in one¡¯s lifetime is from inside rather than outside. Lots\u000aof lines in the film are valuable for us to take our time to taste. And\u000aeveryone shall remember that hope is a good thing.\u000a

V\u000aAfter watching this movie, I was deeply shocked by the scenic: an old\u000aman, who was just released from the prison not ling before, ended his\u000avalued life by a rope. What put him into despair after all?? I wonder.The old man, like most prisoners there, was eager for freedom at the\u000afirst minutes he was put into the prison. Now getting rid of the\u000aterrible life , he should be happy and grateful .however , when he set\u000ahis feet first on the land outside the prison gate, he stood for a\u000ashort while and watched around with the expression of confusion and\u000asuspicion on his wrinkling face before setting off. I can imagine what\u000ahis reaction was. ¡°Is it the same world before I was sent into the\u000aprison?¡± no! Everything is rather strange to him as if he was a UFO.He went into the prison as a young man and came out as an old man. He\u000awas used to living in the world surrounded by four high and thick\u000awalls. Everything was done as told .No choices, no rights. Although he\u000awas a free man now, what could an old man do to survive himself in the\u000aworld full of intensive competition? Long years¡¯ stay in the prison\u000amade him an impotent man. How could he develop new abilities to keep\u000apace of times? NO one understood him and showed sympathy on him, but\u000ablamed him for his clumsiness and sluggishness. nobody paid attention\u000ato him and cared about him. What a lonely man!!! No wonder that the old\u000aman felt himself useless and helpless and committed suicide.At this point, I can not help asking one question. Who pleads guilty or\u000awho is responsible for this matter? Maybe you will say it is none of\u000ayour business. Is it only the old man¡¯s personal affairs? Do\u000agovernments or the authorities set the institutes like prisons for the\u000apurpose to let those who commit crimes have the chance to turn a new\u000aleaf of their life? Undoubtfully. But why do they reject again and\u000aagain those who have realized their guilt and decided to lead a new\u000alife? It is clear that they do not want to free any prisoner until all\u000aare too old to contribute to society. What a satire!!!This film reflects such a phenomenon, which should be paid special\u000aattention to not only by the authorities but also by ordinary citizens.\u000a

Whether contrary to go\u000aagainst and crime must flee in defeat together . The ones that\u000aabandoned Jehovah must cause and wither away. It is said that is "\u000arescued and redeemed ¡° the origin of here. According to rough\u000astatistics, in whole these word appear the amount of time 16 altogether\u000a" with have a match inferior book ". Very obvious, it symbolizes\u000apractice of Christ's thought, has very important meanings. Reach\u000areligious era, " is it redeem to rescue " become about western keyword\u000aof inner world for a time because its clear one is directional. Since\u000ait is so, then we can draw the following conclusions : Namely "\u000arescueing and redeeming" evolves from the specific crowd (Christian )\u000aand specific times (religious times ), and with disappearance of faith\u000aof the western society since the the 20th century, humanism replace god\u000aa doctrine, this word seems not to reply either popularly. But famous director Frank's Germany drew the Nation specially from "\u000afour stories in spring " of Stephen's King in the 1990s China seems to\u000adraw this banker's story having no intention. A great film was born\u000aafterwards. This film " resembles and explains the rescueing and is\u000aredeemed of gram ", about rescueing the story redeemed in a piece of\u000atimes that faith lacks.Frank Germany draw whom Nation want to whom who is display specially\u000arescue and redeeming in the film then? It is two words to rescue and redeem the main fact: Hope. The ones that\u000aare rescued and redeemed are two words too: Freedom. It is a theme of the whole film to hope.When I reviewed this film again, I suddenly felt, this Andy, is it\u000areally another modern Jesus of edition? To suffer a calamity or\u000adisaster he, declare publicly sentence that of Jehovah prophesy " must\u000abelong to positive person among them because common justice is it\u000aredeem to rescue all the time. Whether contrary to go against and crime\u000amust flee in defeat together . The ones that abandon Jehovah must cause\u000aand wither away ". And it specially seems to really mould him into\u000apersonages of a Jesus type that Germany draws the Nation , crying into\u000athe air the wording of wall " trial of main fact come quickly " is it\u000aannotate this to seem before committing suicide to warden since he\u000aescapes from Shawshank. But we can see the spirit of revolt to destiny\u000aof a kind of freeman from him too, this is that one gets the person\u000athat liberated on soul , cages of any essence can not all fetter him,\u000aas a person whose reality exists, Though his human body receives the\u000atribulation , not withering away , the real action comes to resist, and\u000aold Brown, let to Jack fly away , has imprisoned oneself , this forms\u000athe distinct contrast with Andy, tell people: No matter in any place ,\u000aso long as there is the last hope in the heart, then live, otherwise\u000acontent with numb reality , have no difference with the death. Yes, hope to rescue and redeem freedom, this is rescueing and redeeming\u000ain modern civilization structured again, except oneself, we are unable\u000ato rely on unreal rescueing the main fact.Mandela has said: "The heart\u000ais a person's strongest part. "If our heart does not stop , hopes Exist\u000aall the time.¡±Finally, that letter conduct of leaving Andy for Reed finishesIt is a good thing to harbor the hope, perhaps it is the best thing,\u000ait is hopeful forever to harbor the hope, since you have already\u000areached here, has gone far a little more.\u000a

V\u000aThis film is one of those you would like to keep and watch over and\u000aover. Not a typical jailbird flick. Rather a story about struggle and\u000aovercoming and greatness. A happy end in this one feels true and\u000abelievable although it wasn't necessary.Another interesting thing is that none of the characters in it is made\u000ato be hated. No classical "bad guys". Everybody here serves a certain\u000apurpose to the story, thus directing the fate of protagonists.I couldn't believe it was Steven King who wrote this. I generally don't\u000alike his stories, but that should obviously go for his sci-fi novels\u000aonly. They all start well but finish ridiculously. However, it turns\u000aout that the man also penned "the Green Mile", another story that\u000abecame a film that left a true impression. Gotta stop berating Steven\u000aKing.\u000a

V\u000a*Possible SpoilerI was fifteen years old at the time this film was released, and it\u000ainstantly became one of my favorite films after the first time I\u000awatched it. Part of the film was shot 10 minutes from where I grew up\u000aat the Wyandot County Court House in Upper Sandusky, Ohio. A classmate\u000aof mine's father was a juror in the opening scenes of the film. The\u000arest of the film was shot about 45 minutes from my home in Mansfield,\u000aOhio at the historic Mansfield Reformatory. Every year, the famous\u000aprison has haunted tours and sleepovers during the Halloween season,\u000aand is open for historic tours during other parts of the year. There\u000aare many websites devoted to this site. Being a fairly rural area of\u000athe state, it is quite an honor to have lived near the filming of one\u000aof the best films of all time. As I have grown into an adult, I have\u000agrown to appreciate the artistic value of the film even more. Morgan\u000aFreeman delivers his best performance (all of his are great though).\u000a"Red" is the epitome of a man who just wants to be part of life.\u000aAlthough confined inside walls, he can function normally by doing\u000athings to make others happy, in turn making himself happy. He is much\u000alike any working man that lives on the outside. Andy (Tim Robbins) just\u000aamazes you with his selflessness. He sacrificed his own well-being for\u000aothers many times during his stay at the Shawshank. It took him a\u000alongtime, but his desire to live eventually freed him. The film left me\u000asurprised many times. But once you have got to know Andy, nothing he\u000adoes will surprise you. He's the guy you knew back in the day that had\u000aall the luck. (We've all known guys or girls like that). This film is\u000a10 out of 10. It has moments of suspense, mystery, action, surprise,\u000adrama, sadness, and even a little comedy if you know where to look for\u000ait.\u000a

V\u000aEvery family has a film they watch together on a regular basis or for a\u000aspecial occasion/ holiday. Hoosiers and The Shawshank Redemption are\u000athe ones for my family. I'm sure I've seen this marvelous film at least\u000a100 times since I was ten. This film reminds us that motion pictures\u000astill have the power to make us laugh, cry or look at ourselves from a\u000anew point of view. This is one of those rare films that makes you proud\u000ato be alive. Andy's struggles and redemption show us that hope is a\u000abeautiful thing and it never dies. My personal favorite scene in the\u000aentire film is Andy's crawl through 300 yards of sewage to freedom. The\u000ashot of his victory in which he stands in the rain with open arms\u000aembracing freedom is one of the most powerful and beautiful shots ever\u000acaught on film. I get tears of joy every time I see it. All in all,\u000athis is a remarkable film that like hope, will live forever. rating:\u000a10/10if you like this you may also like: Magnolia, American History X,\u000aAmerican Beauty, Rain Man, Garden State\u000a

V\u000aThis movie is almost perfect. I seen it a dozen of times and it keeps\u000agetting better. Best movie ever. Why? Because the satisfaction you get\u000ain the end! You know how he did it and you can almost feel how he must\u000ahave felt! This movie is pure glory. This movie is the best description\u000aof the word hope. Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman are both great actors\u000aand they have some kind of chemistry. And the one thing this movie is\u000aso great is that you don't want it to end. You know it is going to end\u000abut you want it to go on and on and on. But unfortunately, every\u000abeginning has also an end. That is from another movie which we all know\u000aand was by the way very disappointing.\u000a

V\u000aMost people who see this movie for the first time are not going to\u000aappreciate it completely. This is maybe the only movie, in my opinion,\u000athat keeps getting better the more times I watch it. Having seen the\u000amovie at least 20 times I feel that it is quite possibly the best movie\u000aever made. Some may be more entertaining, like say Indiana Jones and\u000athe Last Crusade, but none as compelling. The movie creates a world of\u000adifferent emotions, mainly through its two main characters, Red and\u000aAndy. The acting is incredible. The message is stronger than that of\u000amost any movie, and is stated very clearly. "Hope is a good thing,\u000amaybe the best of things, and no good thing ever dies." After being\u000adrained by the sad events that occur in the movie, the ending uplifts,\u000aand thoroughly fulfills the gaps that it could leave you with. Although this is a great and uplifting movie I realize that are a few\u000athings wrong with it, like in any movie. The issue of race is not\u000aaddressed because it wasn't originally meant to. In Stephen King's\u000ashort story, Red is white. In casting Morgan Freeman the movie is left\u000aa little empty on that subject. This does not devalue it, but does\u000aleave the audience a little confused about why it is not addressed. Do\u000anot watch this movie and expect to be completely entertained, just\u000awatch it for its quality, and maybe you'll be left with as much\u000athought-provoking material as I was. I am glad it is ranked as high as\u000ait is, which shows that does get through to most people, but I think it\u000ashould move two spaces up on the list.\u000a

V\u000aSci-Fi, Heroic fantasy are good stories and can make good films? But\u000ahow can we compare movies that make you enjoy cinema and a movie that\u000aadds dimensions such as thinking a long time after the show, and that\u000amakes you behave differently?Human relationships, hope, will, friendship are eternal themes... If\u000ayou want to watch a movie that will move you, watch this movie. If you\u000awant to entertain, go and watch LOTR, Star Wars.Classify movies depending on your personnality, your moods, your own\u000atastes, is good. To my mind this film is really great and i'm not\u000asurprised at all if it is nowadays ranked in 2nd place.\u000a

V\u000aThe great words spoken by Andy to Red. Never give up. Shawshank is a\u000amovie based on a book by Stephen King. When I tell people this it is\u000ahard for them to believe. This is the best adaptation of a King story\u000athat he has not written the screenplay for. Even though some of the\u000acharacters in the movie don't fit the descriptions from the story they\u000awork.The movie shows the life of a prisoner convicted of a crime that he\u000asays he did not commit and the great friendship he develops with Red\u000aand the daily problems a prisoner faces. This is a great story and I\u000anever get tired of watching it. I have seen it 30 times and it gets\u000abetter every time.Get busy living or get busy dying.\u000a

V\u000a... it has to be felt.Look at these comments. People around the world, from India to China to\u000aEngland to god knows where else, have been deeply touched by this film.\u000aYes, some people don't get it. But look at those who do! The religious\u000afind God in it. The secular find the best of humanity. Those who were\u000adespairing found hope. Skeptics... doesn't that count for something?Enough has been said about the cinematography, the score, the directing\u000aand what not. All those technical things that a film needs to be great.\u000aAnd all those things were great in this movie, in my own, uneducated,\u000aestimation.But that's not why I love it. I love it for what it did to me.When this movie came out, I was fresh out of college and working my\u000afirst job in Miami -- some 1,500 miles away from anyone I loved or who\u000aloved me. I never wanted the job, in fact, I had to bite my tongue to\u000akeep from crying when they offered it. But there was a recession in my\u000aindustry, so I felt I had to.In short, I was in prison. We've all been there, at one point or\u000aanother.Shawshank gave me my life back. I watched Andy mail a letter a week; I\u000amailed 10 a week -- resumes and portfolios sent to anyone I thought\u000acould help me. Every other weekend or so I'd go see the movie. Sunday\u000anight I'd put together my resume packets and Monday I'd send them out.\u000aShawshank reminded me that I am the captain of the ship, and that I had\u000abetter get busy living or get busy dying. In the end, none of those resumes got me what I wanted. I wound up\u000aleaving Miami on my own after eight months (but I swear, it seemed like\u000aI'd been there an eternity...) I don't know that I'd have been able to\u000ado that -- or do it that quickly -- if Shawshank hadn't come along.I'd like to say that what I learned from Shawshank stayed with me\u000aalways, but I can't. I forget. I let myself feel trapped. But then I\u000apop this DVD in, and I remember: You are never imprisoned. You always\u000ahave options. You're always in control and there's always hope.So, to paraphrase Red, you doubters can go on and stamp your "1" or "4"\u000arating on Shawshank if it makes you feel good to be a naysayer. I don't\u000agive a damn. I know firsthand the power of this film. It's changed my\u000alife, just as it has the lives of so many others.\u000a

V\u000a\u000aI've heard many great things about this movie from my friends all\u000athroughout the last 10 years. And for some reason I have never seen the\u000amovie for myself until now. And now 10 years after it was originally\u000areleased, I can now see what all the praise is about. And in my\u000aopinion, no movie in my mind even compares to this one. Not ever have I\u000afelt this way before after watching a movie. When I finished watching\u000athis film it took me a good while to realize where I was and realize\u000athat what I was watching was not in fact a part of my life. This movie\u000alet me escape reality for a little while, and made me forget about\u000aeverything that was going on in my life. When people are stressed and\u000awant to get away, they spend thousands of dollars on a vacation. But if\u000ayou don't have money to spend, just watch this movie. Even though you\u000aonly escape from your everyday life for a couple hours, it will make\u000ayou feel like you were away for a long time. And will give you a better\u000asense of how important it is to keep hope, and to never give up, as\u000alife is too beautiful to run away from. This movie really should be #1\u000aon IMDb but #2 ain't bad. Definitely my favourite movie ever because it\u000ais so much more than a movie. It's a means of just escaping the stress\u000ain your life and in the end, makes you feel really really good about\u000alife. Whenever I'm feeling down, I'll put on this movie, and realize\u000ahow beautiful the world we live in is.\u000a\u000a

V\u000a\u000aMy criterion for movie rating was Schindler's List until I watched\u000aShawshank Redemption. It's simply beautiful - it's simply the best.The movie turns from a simple routine jail story to a jail break to\u000asomething that is more important in each of our life. It's a single\u000aindividual person's realization of his mistakes, patience for 20 years,\u000acharacter's smartness that shines through out the movie.In this movie: Andy takes revenge from all who contributed to his\u000asufferings from individuals to system. Andy helps every one of his\u000amates without judging them. Andy fights for everyone with sharpness and\u000asmartness. Andy gives hope to his best mate and invites him to be part\u000aof his future dream. He tells him what to do when come out of jail.\u000aAndy proves himself to be the knower of everything but then pretending\u000ahe is just an average banker. However, his plans are so amazingly\u000aorganize that he is always on top of situation. One of the reasons is\u000ahis involvement in multiple projects. Exploring all options to get out\u000aof the jail from helping mates to breaking jail. But then from the very\u000abeginning he knows that he may be left with the last option only.Amazingly beautiful conclusion. Amazingly beautiful plot. Amazingly\u000abeautiful cost.Well-done Guys. My mind wants to see a movie that is better than Shawshank Redemption,\u000abut my hearts prays let it stay on top of my list for the rest of my\u000alife. I AM CONTENT. You too, buy a DVD and get busy living.\u000a\u000a

V\u000a\u000aAndy Dufresne (Tim Robbins), a banker, is convicted of his wife and her\u000alover's murder, which he did not commit. He is sentenced to life in\u000aprison at Shawshank Prison where he learned the ups and downs of prison\u000alife. Andy becomes friends with 'Red' (Morgan Freeman). Red was the man\u000ain prison who could get things, whether it be cigarettes or a bag of\u000areefer. Andy ends up with an easier job than most prisoners because of\u000ahis level of education. He becomes a banker by doing taxes and setting\u000aup savings plans for guards. This helps Andy to make friends with the\u000aguards and even the Warden to make his stay at Shawshank more\u000apleasurable. Director Frank Darabont is showing us that life is\u000adifficult, no matter what side of the fence we are on. Inmates are\u000afaced with corruption, rape, and abuse, the same things that can occur\u000ain the world outside of prison. We are not all faced with these things\u000ahappening to us, but we hear about these happening to others.\u000aNaturally, we have to worry about it happening to us. The inmates are\u000aput to work just as we work in the outside world. They must earn their\u000akeep as we do for fear of the consequences of not working, which are\u000asevere in and out of prison. Shawshank Redemption portrays everything\u000athat I think prison would be like, or at least the way society has lead\u000ame to believe it would be like. For example, the gang known as the\u000a'sisters' in Shawshank catch other men alone to beat or to rape them.\u000aThen there is Red, the guy who can get things. Red makes money off\u000aother inmates by charging them extra for what he gets smuggled into the\u000aprison for them. I think that Shawshank Redemption is a movie which can\u000abe watched several times and not become bored with it. I have actually\u000aenjoyed the pleasure of watching this movie several times and would\u000arecommend that anyone watch this movie.\u000a\u000a

V\u000a\u000aSometimes the rarest of gems emerges from the most unlikely places, and\u000ain the most unlikely environments. Who might expect a sterling\u000acinematic diamond in the rough set in a fictional Maine prison, and\u000aderived from a Stephen King short story?Shawshank is a sweeping tale of friendship, hope, innocence, naivete,\u000abrutality, injustice, and vindication, wrapping you in the paradoxical\u000awarmth of the prison walls that surround the sympathetic characters who\u000acaptivate our attention while telling their story. The theme of Shawshank is well known; Andy Dufresne, a Maine banker, is\u000awrongfully accused of murdering his wife after finding her in a\u000acompromising relationship with the golf pro of a local country club.\u000aThe next 18 years of Andy's life depict the spectrum of the human\u000aexperience, as we realize Andy's tale of prison life is an allegory for\u000aanyone whose life is constrained by imprisonment, whether socially\u000acorrective or mentally imposed. The friendship between Red and Andy carries almost a religious air; in\u000acomes Dufrense preaching a gospel of hope to those very nearly deprived\u000aof it in their "institutionalized" setting. The danger of an alternate\u000afuture, and the risks associated with exploring it, magnify the\u000astrength of the hope Andy conveys to his prison peers. Andy's precision-strike vindication against the Warden at the film's\u000aconclusion makes his character the Superman to this gang of inmates,\u000aexposing the corruption and power-brokering that turned Shawshank from\u000aa correctional institution into a dismal penal colony. This is not a sanitized representation of prison life; the worst kinds\u000aof behavior you might know of from prison legends are depicted here.\u000aAnd in the end, it makes you realize that perhaps hope is appreciated\u000amost in a place where it seems the least appropriate. If a prisoner can\u000amaintain hope in a prison cell, then surely we can, too.\u000a\u000a

V\u000a\u000aThinking back to when this was released I was only about 11 yrs old so\u000aprobably wouldn't have taken much of an interest in this type of movie\u000aanyway, but this film was criminally underrated at the time, only about\u000abreaking even in box office terms when on reflection it is probably in\u000athe top 5 movies of all time.I did manage to see this when I just\u000arented it out on video a couple of years later and the upshot of its\u000abeing barely recognised or credited at that time was that for a change,\u000aI didn't really know much about the film before watching and certainly\u000adidn't know how it ends which I feel is a real must for you to enjoy\u000athis movie properly.Without giving anything away this movie will almost make you feel like\u000ayou are serving the life sentence that has been falsely put upon Andy\u000aDufresne (brilliantly played by Tim Robbins) for murder along side him,\u000asuffering along the way with him.Its also a period piece set in a\u000atypical prison of the 40's/50's where prison just wasn't the holiday\u000acamp it seems to be nowadays and life meant life.It therefore goes with\u000athe territory that you see some of the brutal treatment dished out to\u000athe prisoners and knowing all along that Andy is the only innocent guy\u000ain the whole joint makes it even harder to take as he seems to get\u000atreated worst than most what with all the murders, and rapists walking\u000aaround who often target him.Andy is a very bright fellow though and\u000auses his intelligence, and friendship with Morgan Freemans character\u000a'Red' to somehow help him through it.Weighing in at almost 3hrs the\u000amovie can be tough going but is always entertaining, with a sentimental\u000astreak which isn't necessarily a bad thing with an uplifting ending\u000awith a twist that leaves you with a great sense of satisfaction.

V\u000a\u000aIt's been a long time since I saw the movie and I still have it as the\u000abest memory when I sit in front of TV and enjoy the magic of a\u000amagnificent movie.Yesterday, we had a discussion on a Chinese movie board about which is\u000athe best movie in history. The answer was Shawshank's Redemption. It's\u000aa movie delivering good sense of hope in life and the best story to\u000ainspire people truly from inside. I feel I gotta say something about\u000ait again when it's the time of 10 years anniversary for such a great\u000amovie.Many people are still talking about whether it should have got above\u000aForest Gump in 1995 Oscar. I personally think it's reasonable for\u000aForest Gump winning Oscar. But I think there is one actor who should\u000ahave won a supporting actor : James Whitmore who acted old Brook in the\u000amovie. I don't know why, but his character impacted me the most. Esp.\u000awhen he got free and began narrate the letter he wrote to his prison\u000afolks. I am a young man and did not have enough experience in life, but\u000aI felt something there, strongly, something that made me moved to\u000atears. The director did great jobs in this sense, bringing quite a few\u000acharacters who are far yet close to us. They have weakness and doubt in\u000alife just like we did in our lives. Everyone make mistakes, some are\u000asmall which can be ignored, some are so big that even a life time\u000asentence does not judge enough. But they are common. the thing is what\u000ayou realize in life: Incarnation or refreshment.I cant say how much the movie changed my life. This might be the only\u000amovie so far to change my life ever. But I can say I became a better\u000aperson after this. (I am not saying I was a bad guy , keke). And I will\u000athink about hopes no matter how bad are the situations. The movie is\u000apure magic.I saw the movie with my mom, who usually does not see Hollylwood\u000amovies. But this is the second movie which did not make her\u000asleep.(keke, the other one was Titanic) I did not expect anything more\u000afrom the movie , yet it ended as a magic night for me. I can keep going on and on talking about how great the movie was. And I\u000athink the reason for those people who do not enjoy the movie that much\u000ais because they already know or expect too many things before seeing\u000ait. I am sorry that nowadays there are not so good movies around in\u000aHollywood and I hope I can find another magic one soon. I will buy the coming DVD and put in my shelf. I hope someday I can let\u000amy son see it and tell him how important hope is.\u000a\u000a

V\u000a\u000aI made my Stephen King debut with this particular story when I was in\u000amy late teens. Frank Darabont shot a wonderful adaptation which is not\u000avery common. Great actor Tim Robbins played the unfortunate Dufresne\u000awith such a grace that you never think that the guy was very small in\u000asize in the original story. Morgan Freeman is in his prime playing Red,\u000athe most useful person in the jail. The suicide of the old prisoner and\u000athe last scene where both friends meet are the most emotional ones. And\u000aof course we should salute the most beautiful supporting actress ever,\u000aRita Hayworth. Darabont never tries to steal parts from the original\u000astory. May be this is why the film is always remembered as a good piece\u000aof art.\u000a\u000a

V\u000a\u000aRather than just enjoy movies, critics like to play "The Greatest Film"\u000agame.  A few years back, it was rare that a contemporary film was picked as\u000agreatest.  "Citizen Kane," "Le Grand Illusion," "The Gold Rush" and other\u000apre-1950 films usually got the nod well into the 1980's.Then, for some reason, most likely the Internet opening up a voice for the\u000aaverage person to rate film, contemporary films started getting in. \u000a"Schindler's List" was one that comes to mind.  "Shawshank Redemption" is\u000aanother.While picking the same old, stale films year after year doesn't seem to be\u000alogical, picking newer ones has a certain risk.  Many films amaze and\u000abeguile audiences when they come out because they are geared to what\u000acurrently sells.  As years passed, the flaws become apparent and they drop\u000aout of sight, while timeless films initially received lukewarmly, or even\u000acritically, such as "The Wizard of Oz," "The General," or "Intolerance"\u000asoar.  Will "The Shawshank Redemption" drop into obscurity, too?  I don't think so.\u000a Why?  One can try to explain.Two possible reasons are Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman.  I don't know if\u000aeither are underrated actors or not, but I rarely hear people remark how\u000acompletely they transform themselves from role to role.  This is certainly\u000athe case here. The two performances, and the chemistry between the two men\u000ais the core of the film and reinforces one of its primary messages: never\u000alet anyone make you lose hope.  The fact the setting, prison, is alien to most filmgoer's experience,\u000adoesn't matter.  "Shawshank" could never be considered a "prison" film.  It\u000acontains a story as archetypal as "The Odyssey," a long journey, through\u000amany dangers, that ends with the traveler (this time, two travelers) seen to\u000aa safe shore (literally!).Another great strength of "Shawshank" is how it operates on different\u000alevels.  Like Jon Avnet's "Fried Green Tomatoes," it has its most obvious\u000amessage--about not losing hope and surviving--set highest.  But as\u000a"Tomatoes" had a gay subtext that could be acknowledged or ignored, so does\u000a"Shawshank," that prison is a dehumanizing experience that ends up ruining\u000apeople for life rather than just letting them pay their debts to society and\u000amove on.Given this country's conservative bent, it is somewhat bizarre that a film\u000athat carries this message is so adored.  All I can say is the other aspects\u000aof the film allow one to ignore it and still enjoy it, which is probably\u000afitting since films where the message is the most important thing, such as\u000athose of the '50's and '60's, now show their age badly. In the final analysis, though, regardless of what elements we pick at, we\u000aultimately can't say why "Shawshank" is so great.  We just know it is by how\u000awe feel and how others feel.Two final examples of the latter.  [Spoiler]  The moment in Andy's escape\u000awhen he stands in the sewage lagoon outside the prison and holds his arms up\u000ain jubilation as the rain pours on him is always a part of trailers and\u000acoming attractions.  Indeed it was part one of the film's original ads.  Why\u000ashould the filmmakers give away the ending?  Because there is nothing to\u000agive away.  One can see the film 100 times knowing Andy will escape and\u000astill want to see it, because it isn't about an escape plot.  It's about\u000aAndy and Red's journey and what they teach each other.The second example is that the Lifetime Channel, which generally shows\u000aeither classic "Chick Flicks" like "Thelma and Louise," or made for TV\u000athings about unfaithful or homicidal husbands, showed this as their feature\u000apresentation one evening and this is a film that really has no women in it\u000aat all.Of course, one can argue a "Chick Flick" is really just a film that values\u000aexploration of deep human feelings and relationships more than car chases\u000aand explosions.  If that is the case, then "Shawshank" is the greatest Chick\u000aFlick of them all.And I think the Greatest Film Game never fit more than\u000ahere.\u000a

V\u000a\u000aI think this movie is clearly a 10. To call it the second best movie of all\u000atime might be a bit over the top. However, it is impressive that it has got\u000aalmost 120.000 votes. Anyway, I thought it was really interesting. Tim\u000aRobbins is a very good actor and so is Morgan Freeman. Anyway, there is one\u000athing that annoys me, and that is the focus on what one might call\u000a"transgression". I mean the warden and sadistic prison guards - all this is\u000aa bit too far out I think and works to the movies disadvantage. The love of\u000atransgression is always followed by some kind of sentimental prejudice.\u000aHowever, that does not damage the movie as a whole. It´s really an amazing\u000astory which keeps you guessing till the end. \u000a

Tim Robbins makes you feel like you are living his role in the movie.\u000aMorgan Freeman is, well what can I say, he does an award winning\u000aperformance. This movie is about the lives of two prisoners (and others) inside the\u000awalls of Shawshank Prison. It covers so many aspect of prison life.\u000aBoth the bad and the good. This movie reflect the acceptance of life on\u000athe inside, and does it in a very real way.All of the characters do an amazing performance. The prison setting is\u000aso real for a setting in the 40's and 50's.Take a few hours from your busy life, and spend it enjoying this movie.\u000aYou will enjoy this, I promise.\u000a\u000a

V\u000a\u000aThe ending of this movie might be the most rewarding ending I've ever\u000aseen, from a movie-goers point of view. Not only is Andy an innocent\u000aman, it seems he suffers more than all the guilty men around him. After\u000ahe climbs out of the sewer and tastes freedom after decades of unjust\u000aimprisonment, his passion for his newly found freedom is almost\u000apalpable from the theatre seat or my home sofa (wherever I'm watching\u000ait). I challenge you to find a movie with a better ending. Questions:\u000aIs Andy raped by the "sisters" or no? I thought Morgan Freeman's\u000avoice-over was kind of unclear on this point. Number two. What are the\u000aodds that the tin box that contains the money and note wouldn't be all\u000arusted out?\u000a\u000a

No\u000amovie other than "The Accidental Tourist" has had such an influence on\u000amy life. This movie is about hope and it shows you that it can never be\u000alost. It also shows you that the weakest looking people may actually be\u000athe strongest. The thing about Shawshank Redemption is even if you hate\u000adramas you'll appreciate this movie nevertheless. This movie stopped me\u000afrom being an action genre junkie and turned me into a connoisseur of\u000agreat movies. Even though there is no science-fiction in this movie\u000ayou'll still feel that its magical. However, the first time you view it\u000awill be the best.

No explosions, no special effects, no stunts,\u000ano females... no chance it would be good, right. Wrong! The on-screen\u000aduo of Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman should be the envy of any actors\u000athat ever have to share a set with other actors. The supporting cast\u000awas remarkable, and the storyline is second to none. I'm glad I sucked\u000ait up that first time, because without that first time watching "The\u000aShawshank Redemption", I would have never been able to watch it the\u000atwenty times that I have.

V\u000a\u000aThis is a very thrilling movie that kept me spellbound. The acting is first\u000arate. Morgan Freeman is superb and so is Tim Robbins. The reason why in my\u000aopinion it only deserves 8 out of 10 rather than 9 is that the story is not\u000athat great. Anyone who has seen his or her share of prison films will have\u000acome across all the standard ingredients: brutality by the staff, abuse by\u000afellow prisoners, corruption at the top, we have seen it all before (cf. for\u000aexample Brubaker).

I digress, the first\u000atime\u000aI saw this movie, I was actually touched by the story.I began to feel crappy for Andy, I understood Red's bitterness, disgusted\u000awhen Andy crawled out the crap pipe. The movie tells a very very\u000apowerfully\u000adepressing story, but to keep the watcher from getting mad has an\u000aamazingly\u000auplifting ending, that makes the story seem worth it.Amazing, enough said.\u000a

It's\u000apointless describing the story, suffice to say that it stands head and\u000ashoulders above all other movies as a testament to the endurance and power\u000aof the human spirit, that almost no matter what situation we find ourselves\u000ain, we can endure and prevail.

V\u000a\u000a<<WARNING: EXTREME SPOILERS>>I won't argue that this is a really good film. It is. But I've always felt\u000ait's been built up a bit too much. It's well-structured, well-paced, and\u000aMorgan Freeman gives a brilliant performance, along with all of his\u000aco-stars. But it's still something of a modern fairy tale. We never doubt\u000athat things will turn out all right in the end for Andy and Red, or that\u000aNorton will get his comeuppance. This, combined with a tendency to get\u000acloying, particularly with the opera record and the spunky kid, effectively\u000aknocks it out of the running as one of the all-time greats.All this aside, however, it's impact can't be denied either. Frank Darabont\u000amay have let his sentimentality go raging out of control on The Green Mile\u000anext, but he just enough restraint here to move us almost to tears. And this\u000asame emotional black-and-white treatment allows plot points that might have\u000abeen laughed of in a more cynical film to feel perfectly satisfying. Tell me\u000ayou didn't raise a fist in triumph when Norton blew his brains out. And\u000aregarding sentiment, it certainly wasn't 1994's worst offender.

In fact there are\u000anone\u000aof the things that are normally "required" to make a film commercial.\u000a(Perhaps this accounts for its modest showing at the box office.)  What it\u000a*has* got is humanity, subtlety and a great story with a brilliant payoff!\u000aOne of the first DVDs I ever bought and by far the most played.\u000a\u000a

V\u000a\u000aTo me, for a movie to be in the Top 10 all-time, it has to hold up torepeated viewings. This one does not. I can watch Jaws, City Slickers,Goodfellas, Titanic, everytime they are on because they exude a certainfeeling of a certain time and space. I am sure everyone here has moviesthat do that to them. Yes, I enjoyed Shawshank Redemption immensely whenI first saw it. I was suprized at the ending and found it holding myattention throughout. But just like Usual Suspects, after you know theending, and the cat is out of the bag, so to speak, the movie becomesjust a collection of characters and acting. And unless you aremesmerized by the performances, the movie just loses it's appeal. Unlikemovies that have more of a attitude or aural feel to them where you getcaught up in the ambience of the movie(stuff like City Slickers,Godfather, Goodfellas, Chinatown..) this movie just doesn't hold upbased strictly on the performances. I love Morgan Freeman and will watchmost anything he is in, especially Driving Miss Daisy and Seven. Itamazes me how this movie is considered the #2 movie alltime by thiss\u000a

V\u000a\u000aThis is one of my favorite movies and the very first movie I ever bought\u000aon\u000aDVD. Because I am a fan of Stephen King, I had to see this movie. The\u000amovie\u000ais based on a short story from King's book "Different Seasons" (Rita\u000aHayworth and the Shawshank Redemption). The story is about a banker (Tim\u000aRobbins) who is found guilty of killing his wife and her lover. He is sent\u000ato prison and develops a friendship with several of the inmates. However,\u000athe main focus is on Andy's close relationship with Red (Morgan Freeman)\u000awho\u000ahas been in prison most of his adult life. I don't want to give up too\u000amuch\u000afor those who haven't seen it. (I'll leave that up to the other posters).\u000aIf\u000ayou like `The Green Mile' (another Darabont movie from a Stephen King\u000abook)\u000ayou will love this movie.\u000a

V\u000a\u000aThe Shawshank Redemption is a film about the wrongful conviction of\u000abanker\u000aAndy Dufresne,(tim robbins) who is convicted of murder and sentenced to\u000atwo\u000aback to back life imprisonments.In the beginning of the film you\u000aprimarily\u000athink of Andy to be somewhat of a "cold fish". By the way that his\u000a"icy-cold" facial expressions appear, on first viewing it really makes\u000ayou\u000aponder if he is guilty. After months at Shawshank, Andy begins bonding\u000awith\u000ainmate "Red" Redding, who is very well known to the prisoners to get\u000aitems\u000afor them from time to time. Andy is soonly aware, and gets many helping\u000aitems in his own personal scheme. During the film you will learn that\u000aShawshank is a corrupt Maine penitentiary that doesn't tolerate\u000ainappropriate behaviour, especially with head guard Byron Hadley, who is\u000aas\u000amean as they come.During the film, Andy overhears Byron talking about inheritance money\u000afrom\u000ahis deceased brother with fellow guards. Andy, being the "hot-shot"\u000abanker\u000athat he is, confronts Byron and eventually works out a deal with him,\u000aafter\u000aa near-death experience. Andy eventually gains recognition with the\u000aguards\u000aand helps them set-up their banking. Warden Samuel Norton notices Andy's\u000atalent and hires him as a library assistant working alongside a man by\u000athe\u000aname of Brooks. After the passing of Brooks,(who was released on parole)\u000aShawshank upgrades the library with the shere help of Andy who takes over\u000aas\u000ahead librarian.\u000aThings really take a twisted turn when new inmate Tommy Williams arrives\u000aat\u000aShawshank for assault and battery, and later is discovered to have the\u000avery\u000aevidence that could possibly free Andy Dufresne. Holding back from the\u000atruth, Norton denies the evidence to be possible and punishes Andy. The\u000athing I find so very odd-striking about Norton is that he believes in the\u000abible, but leads another life of corruptness and cruelty. But after all\u000ahe\u000ais a warden, and they aren't ever nice, according to the advice of\u000aBrooks.I won't give a way anything, but that's just say that Norton disposed any\u000aof\u000aAndy's evidence of getting out of prison in front of a judge and jury.\u000aEventually though, hope set Andy free without parole.(you do the math)\u000aThat's just say that after that, Shawshank prison took a turn for the\u000abetter.Personal Note: I found this to be the greatest prison movie that has ever\u000agraced cinematography. This movie does appear to be a bit overrated on\u000aimdb,\u000abut definitely deserves to be in the top 20 anyday.\u000aI thoroughly enjoyed this film, and the more I watch it, I get a funnier\u000afeeling for all of the characters. Great Movie. 8.5/10\u000a

His character Andy's refusal to voluntarily be changed by\u000anot\u000aonly the betrayal of his wife, being wrongly accused of her murder, but\u000aalso\u000athe harrowing experiences of prison life is palpable to say the least.\u000aIt\u000adoesn't hurt to have one of the 5 best actors of our era, Morgan Freeman,\u000aas\u000ayour supporting man. The friendship between the two makes this story not\u000aonly believable, but also thought provoking and inspirational. The\u000aShawshank\u000aRedemption is truely one of the all time greats.\u000a

V\u000a\u000a"The Shawshank Redemption" is one of the most touching,  thought provoking\u000amovies of all time.  With the fabulous performances from both Morgan Freeman\u000aand Tim Robbins to the amazing ending, "Redemption" never fails to\u000aplease.The story is about Andy Dufresne (Tim Robbins), a small-time banker\u000awrongfully convicted of killing his cheating wife.  He is sent to prison,\u000awhere he meets Red (Morgan Freeman).  The two strike up a friendship that\u000aspans the two decades that Dufresne spends in jail.I'd imagine how hard it was for the writers to make a story that lasts over\u000atwenty years still interesting, but they do it perfectly.  From the inmates\u000adiscussing different books in a library to the sinister warden (Bob Gunton)\u000aforcing Dufresne to do his dirty work, your attention is never taken away\u000afrom the screen.I'd really like to explain the unpredictable ending, but that'd really spoil\u000athe experience, so go see it for yourself!  Great drama,\u000a9/10.\u000a

Very\u000aemotionally powerful and inspiring, the movie was on par with the much\u000ahyped\u000amovie Forrest Gump if not better.\u000aIt was a prison tale that should be lots of despair, misery and violence\u000ayet\u000aShawshank manage to portray the sad as well as hope and salavation of the\u000amind in human beings. Andy(Tim Robbins) as a man who was wrongly convicted\u000aof life imprisonment and refusal to give up and despair and efforts to\u000afind\u000aany means to escape was amazing. His final escape act was a lesson for me\u000ain\u000aperseverance.\u000aA def must watch!\u000aThe novel by Stephan King which Shawshank is based on gave a little more\u000athoughts into the main characters'mind and you must read the short story\u000aif\u000ayou like the movie. \u000a

V\u000a\u000aOne of the best movies of the '90's, The Shawshank Redemption is a an\u000aimpressive story about finding and keeping hope in a situation where it's\u000aonly logical to despair...Spoilers ahead...With brilliant performances by Tim Robbins (and why didn't he get an Oscar\u000anomination too?) and Morgan Freeman (who did get a nomination, but didn't\u000awin) it follows the story of a man, Andy, wrongly accused for the murder of\u000ahis wife and her lover, going to spend his next 20 years in a maximum\u000asecurity penitentiary - Shawshank - where the inmates are less than friendly\u000aand helpful... until you get to know them: then you'll love some and hate\u000aothers, and fear a few.More brutal than the inmates are the guards, who have no problems in busting\u000aa new frightened inmate's head right in the middle of the night in front of\u000aeveryone, leaving him to die.With intelligence, lots of wit and patience, Andy manages to survive in that\u000ahell and turn the lives of inmates and guards upside-down, and bring some\u000ahope back to a world behind bars, sometimes costing him his personal\u000asafety.Emotional and nurturing until the end, The Shawshank Redemption has one of\u000athe most beautiful endings to a movie, reinforcing the theme of friendship\u000aand loyalty.10 out of a brilliant 10, this is a movie no one should miss, if just to\u000alearn how to be better people again...\u000a

I personally thought the ending\u000awas\u000aflawless.

Everything was so good and\u000ahappy even though it was the complete opposite in the beginning.  I\u000aexpected\u000athis to be a very dark movie but it just had that atmosphere in the\u000abeginning and that was about it.

V\u000a\u000aThe Shawshank Redemption is probably the most widely loved movie in all of\u000aWestern culture.  It's fleshed out characters give it the uncanny ability to\u000adeeply touch most of the people who watch it.  We relate to Freeman's\u000acharacter who has lost hope in society.  Robbins' is the friend who redeems\u000aus and gives hope back.  Gunton, who plays Warden Norton, is one of the most\u000aoverlooked villains of all time.  He makes the greatest villain because he\u000ais the most realistic and relatable.  He isn't a crazy murderer, he is a\u000acorrupt religious official.  I believe this movie gets better when you have\u000aalready seen it and know what happens.  Seeing the wardern get what's coming\u000ato him is consistently satisfying.  And of course, the famous beach scene\u000aleaves me on a high every time.  11/10\u000a

V\u000a\u000aAfter reading the two tirades submitted three days-apart (May 28/03 & June\u000a1/03), absolutely shredding this fine film I felt I had to submit my own\u000aviews.  Everyone is indeed entitled to their own opinions, but when so\u000amany\u000apeople love this film and give it the highest kudos possible I have to\u000awonder about the judgement of someone who gives it a zero out of ten!\u000aShawshank has become one my personal favorites over the years and if there\u000awas an injustice done in the 1994 Oscars, it's that the film didn't win.\u000aI\u000awas surprised at the time that the voting membership gave Forest Gump the\u000anod over Shawshank for best picture, but Gump was full of U.S. patriotism\u000aand that always goes a long way at the Oscars.  The Oscar Committee should\u000amaybe check Gump's position in the IMDB top 250 list, or lack of position\u000aas\u000athe case may be.  Shawshank, based on a Stephen King short story and\u000adirected by Frank Darabont (The Green Mile and The Majestic, two more of\u000amy\u000afavorites) is a very well written tale of one mans' false conviction,\u000asubsequent imprisonment and his life long crusade to gain his freedom.  It\u000ais about not surrendering to the hopelessness that must overcome even the\u000astrongest of wills after decades behind bars.  It is about brotherhoods\u000aand\u000afriendships bonded over decades and also about the hatreds and evil that\u000athe\u000asame elements can foster.  Like the other great prison film, Cool Hand\u000aLuke,\u000athe movie takes the side of the prisoners against the system, In story the\u000awarden and head guard are portrayed as truly evil as the rapists and\u000amurderers that they hold sway over.\u000aThis film indeed deserves its high position on the best of list, and in my\u000aopinion should perhaps be moved up one more notch!\u000a\u000a

V\u000a\u000aThis movie (The Shawshank redemption) is the masterpiece. The best movie\u000ai\u000ahave ever seen.And as i see, im not the only one here thinking so.It is the shame for the Academy not to give any Oscars to this movie in\u000a1994. This is the reason why i think Academy/Oscar is not\u000areal\u000ameasure for movie/actor quality.I am very sorry that we will never see the second part (The Shawshank\u000aredemption 2).Great work Tim, Morgan, Clancy Brown, Bill Sadler, Gil, James, Mark,\u000adirector, screenwriters etc. !Greetings from Croatia.PS: If any movie has its message within, this is the one.\u000a

V\u000a\u000aShawshank Redemption is the type of movie that all prison movies should be.\u000aIn fact it is the type of drama that every drama should be. To date I can't\u000athink of a film that has just as much or even more character development\u000athan this film. And what better place to have it in? Both Tim Robbins and\u000aMorgan Freeman make this movie what it is through the characters. Through\u000aRobbins, we can see a character who is determine and will never give up. And\u000athrough Freeman we see a man who knows the truth about life inside and the\u000abold truth. We see most of that through Freeman's reflection in his role as\u000athe narrator. \u000a   I love everything about this film. The cast, sets, characters, scores,\u000ascript, everything. There are only a few movie that are just as good as\u000athis; but shouldn't be compared because like some movies in the film\u000aindustry because it is the key to cinematic brilliance.\u000a

V\u000a\u000aI have just watched this film for the third time and it still knocks me\u000afor\u000a6 and brings tears to my eyes.\u000aIt is criminal that this film did not win any awards. That does not\u000amatter\u000abecause in  time if not already it will without doubt go down as the\u000agreatest film of all time. Nothing gets anywhere near it.\u000a

V\u000a\u000aIf anything, The Shawshank Redemption is just a great film, you cannot even\u000abegin to disagree with that.  It is well written and very believable.  This\u000ais one of the few films in the history of American Cinema that needs to be\u000aas long as it has to be in order to tell the whole story to its audience. \u000aAs we watch this film, it is almost as if we are watching a great artist\u000acreate a new canvas giving it color, texture and varying hues.  By the time\u000awe are through with the film, we can be assured that we have just sat\u000athrough what is almost nearly an epic, in size, depth and\u000alength.Morgan Freeman, the film's narrator, plays the role of Red with an almost\u000apatent sincerity that is hard to pull off most of the time.  Tim Robbins'\u000aAndy Dusfrene is the film's "pretty boy", always looking on the bright side\u000aof anything, which when you are in a place that is as bleak as a prison can\u000abe quite tough.  The two pull off a symbiotic relationship that far\u000atranscends the boundaries of the film itself.  This is a "buddy film" but\u000aquite a different kind.  Red and Andy play off each other well enough, and\u000ait is worth it just to watch the film for that reason alone.The Shawshank Redemption was nominated for seven Academy Awards, including\u000aBest Picture.  Morgan Freeman was nominated as Best Actor, losing to Tom\u000aHanks in Forrest Gump.  It lost Best Adapted Screenplay to Forrest Gump.  It\u000alost Best Cinematography to Legends of the Fall.  It lost Best Film Editing\u000ato Forrest Gump, lost Best Sound to Speed and lost Best Original Score to\u000aDisney's The Lion King.  Of course, The Shawshank Redemption lost the\u000aAcademy Award for Best Picture of 1994 to Paramount's juggernaut mega-hit\u000aForrest Gump.My rating: 3 and a half stars\u000a

V\u000a\u000aMy cousin always recommends good movies to me and when he suggested this\u000amovie, I was not surprised that this was another gem.  This is my all\u000atime\u000afavorite movie!  I can watch it over and over again.  Tim Robbins and\u000aMorgan\u000aFreeman were gypped out of Academy awards for their roles in this movie!\u000aThis was as entertaining as it was exciting as it was suspenseful.  I\u000aactually read the Stephen King novella, Rita Hayworth and the Shawshank\u000aRedemption and was amazed that they could make such a long movie out of\u000asuch\u000aa short story.  However, the movie was great.  I give this movie 11 out\u000aof\u000a10!  That's how much I enjoyed it!  HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS MOVIE!  I don't\u000awant to give away any of the story to those who have not seen it, so I\u000awill\u000aend my review here!  SEE THIS MOVIE!\u000a

V\u000aI caught this movie close to the end just as Morgan Freeman was staring\u000aat the beam on the ceiling considering suicide. He plucks up the\u000acourage to go out look for a job and try to reintegrate himself into\u000athe system but he's been away for the better part of a century. Things\u000ahave moved on and he's been pegged into that corner of existence known\u000aas Shawshank prison.When it ended, I vowed to watch it again and I finally caught it again\u000alast year. The message is strong and vibrant, it resonates throughout\u000athe movie; HOPE NEVER DIES!! It is our steel, our spine, it's what\u000aseparates men from beasts. The movie was a warming experience, I have\u000alearnt from it that friendship has ties that can survive anything,\u000atime, stress, human failings, ANYTHING!! I wanted to walk tall and\u000ashout Peace and Love to everyone.The Shawshank Redemption liberated me from the fear of suffering.Morgan Freeman (who is my icon any-day) blows the screen away just like\u000ahe did in "Lean On Me". Unlike "Lean On Me" however, gentle persuasion\u000aand steady encouragement take the place of fiery enthusiasm. Red gives\u000aAndy the encouragement he needs to fight his way out of his situation\u000abut he teaches him to fight with his mind and heart.Tim Robbins' emotionless Andy is eerie to watch as he drifts languidly\u000awith that glint in his eye that tells of wisdom born of suffering. I\u000awatched as the innocence faded from his face and he "grew" his plan. It\u000ais ironic that the person who was saved in jail for being spineless and\u000aweak, was the one who saved his friend from losing out to the world. When the warden shoots his own brains out, I yelled "Justice" at the TV\u000ascreen. The tag-line for me is "Hope Is A Good Thing" It really is...\u000a

V\u000a\u000aIn reading many reviews of this film, it is evident that people will\u000aeither\u000aabsolutely love it, or absolutely loath it.  I definitely am sided with\u000athe\u000aloving of the movie, however I believe some people are catching a\u000adifferent\u000areason about why it is so enjoyable.  Those who hate this movie definitely\u000adon't see the same message and definitely don't get the point.  This movie\u000ais not made to be a "typical prison movie"  because this one doesn't focus\u000aon those same ideas.  Sure, there are similarities, but that's to be\u000aexpected.  As far as I know (for never having gone to prison)  these\u000adepictions of prison are accurate, however, this film differs in the fact\u000ait\u000ais about HOPE.  The movie isn't just about the main character trying to\u000afree\u000ahimself from prison, it is about his journey through so many years of\u000abeing\u000abeaten, raped, and abused, and never losing his hope.  The other prisoners\u000ain this movie tell him that hope is a dangerous thing, that it can drive\u000apeople crazy.  He ignores the warnings and keeps his hope.  The most\u000abeautiful scene in this film is when he plays the music of the opera over\u000athe loud speaker.  "And just for that one moment, every last man in\u000aShawshank felt free" are roughly the words Morgan Freeman says in his\u000acommentary.  With the cinematography and the words, the feeling of hope is\u000aeven implanted in the viewers themselves.\u000aI ask that those who dislike this film take it from that aspect the next\u000atime they see it, instead of an analytical viewpoint, focusing on\u000adirecting\u000astyle, costumes, "typical prison stuff" and other things and just let\u000atheir\u000asouls take in the true meaning and feeling of hope, and what a beautiful\u000aemotion it is.  I also ask that those who love it view the movie again and\u000aput yourself in a position where you felt there was no hope, that no one\u000acould help you but yourself, and let yourself become entangled in this\u000awonderful web of hope and truly let this film be a redemption of your mind\u000aand soul.\u000a

V\u000a\u000aThere is one simple reason why the Shawshank Redemption is the second\u000abest\u000amovie I've ever seen.  It made me want to be a BETTER PERSON.  It actually\u000achanged my life.  I wanted to help and be kinder to others after watching\u000ait.  The character of Andy defines the human spirit and how a person whose\u000alife is based on values of honesty, goodness, and freedom, will not be\u000acompromised no matter what the situation.\u000aOthers may have their opinions that it isn't that great based on\u000aartistic\u000aand technical merits, but they don't understand, it is the STORY that is\u000acompelling and what that story represents.\u000aThe reason it is #2 in the voting is because it resonates that universal\u000atruth of the human spirit.\u000aIt also portrays how one person by being resolute in their goodness can\u000aaffect others and lift them up.  That is why this movie has so many\u000aemotional high points.  Andy is constantly lifting those around him and\u000amaking their lives better even in one of the hell holes of our\u000asociety.\u000aThe two most emotional points in the movie for me are when he plays the\u000amusic and when Andy and Red embrace on the beach in Zihuatenejo,\u000aMexico.(Bye the way, my #1 favorite movie of all time is 'A Man for All Seasons'\u000awhich is similar to Shashank in that it tells the story of a man who is\u000auncompromising in his beliefs.)\u000a

V\u000a\u000aComplete void of spoilers herein, only read on if you like ridiculous praise\u000aof a movie on a mammoth scale.I just watched The Shawshank Redemption for the second time, and for the\u000asecond time it took my breath away. There is just no real word to describe\u000athe extraordinary piece of cinema that has been created\u000ahere.It tells the story of wrongly accused murderer, Andy Dufresne (Tim Robbins),\u000aand his story of survival inside a maximum security prison, aided by his\u000afriendship with 'the only guilty man inside Shawshank', Ellis 'Red' Reddings\u000a(Morgan Freeman). Along the way it branches into at least six different side\u000astories that, halfway through the movie, while still entertained, one\u000awonders what they have to do with the plot. The answer is everything, as\u000abecomes apparent by the end.I won't bore you with details of the individual craftsmanship that went into\u000athis movie, but I will advise anyone who has not seen it to see it, and as\u000asoon as possible. Keep watching until the end, and there is no possible way\u000ayou can be disappointed. It is absolutely masterly directed by Frank\u000aDarabont, and while I thought that his other Stephen King-based film, The\u000aGreen Mile, was fairly slow and self-indulgent, this isn't. It is drawn out\u000aand long, but absolutely impeccable and amazingly inspirational. It delivers\u000athe message that even in the face of abject adversity, hope will always\u000aprevail. This message was recently hammed up quite terribly in "The Two\u000aTowers", but in The Shawshank Redemption, just one very simple quote sums it\u000aup: "Hope is a good thing. Possibly the best thing. And no good thing ever\u000adies"This is one for the ages. I cannot imagine that the uplifting effect of this\u000amovie will ever die. There is no possible way it could be better. The only\u000apossible reason I can think of for not liking or being inspired by this\u000amovie is that you just don't want to. There are no two ways about it. Even\u000aafter nine years, this holds strong as an absolute masterpiece of\u000afilm-making, and a staggering achievement. Five stars out of\u000afive.\u000a

V\u000a\u000aRarely a movie that tries to be touching achives its purpose.  More often\u000athen not I find myself wanting to throw up at the serious of movies.\u000aWhile\u000aShawshank redemption was very touching, I was to busy being engaged in the\u000astory line and the charecters to worry about the inspirational aspect of\u000athe\u000amovie.  Every single character serves a purpose in this movie.  Tim\u000aRobbins\u000agives a great performance as an innocent man in prison for the murder of\u000ahis\u000awife.  His character doesn't dread on the horrible reality that is before\u000ahim, he just takes it.  His character seems so loss in his new reality and\u000aneeds some guidence which he finds in other inmates.  Shawshank redemption\u000aoffers a realistic view of prison life, and at the same time creates one\u000aof\u000athe most engaging storylines ever.    \u000a

V\u000a\u000a**POSSIBLE SPOILERS (nothing too specific)**Watching The Shawshank Redemption is a downright religious experience; it\u000ais\u000atruly a film to treasure, and one that nobody who sees it will ever\u000aforget.\u000aDirector Frank Darabont's translation of a Stephen King novella to the\u000ascreen is not a great film because of the story itself-the plot is\u000aactually\u000aquite simple and could be carried out in under an hour with relative\u000aease-but because of the way the story unfolds.  Shawshank is a lengthy\u000afilm\u000a(clocking in around 150 minutes), but it doesn't feel so long because the\u000aleading actors are spot-on perfect, the pace is beautifully metered, and\u000athe\u000aemotions (which are never the least bit contrived) build to one of the\u000atensest climaxes in American cinema.The story is told not from the perspective of Andy Dufresne (Tim Robbins),\u000abanker imprisoned for a double-homicide he didn't commit, and the main\u000acharacter in this epic tale, but from the perspective of Red (Morgan\u000aFreeman), `the only guilty man in Shawshank Prison.'  Red has been in\u000aShawshank for twenty years; he's a well-liked inmate among his peers\u000abecause\u000ahe's the guy that can obtain some of the luxuries of the outside world.\u000aIf\u000ayou want a box of cigars or a poster of your favorite pin-up girl, Red's\u000ayour man.  Often, throughout the course of the film, we wonder why Andy\u000aisn't telling the story-after all, he's the character we sympathize with\u000amost.  In the end, we know why, and we're glad Red told the story, since\u000athe\u000afilm ends up being more about him than Andy.  Andy, instead, is just the\u000avehicle for Red's realization that hope and perseverance can free the\u000ahuman\u000amind.While Red is the resourceful handyman, Andy is the smartest man in\u000aShawshank.  He hatches a plan to get the other inmates to accept him by\u000ahaving the guards provide them with alcohol, he comes to be the tax\u000apreparer\u000afor all the guards in Shawshank as well as several neighboring prisons, he\u000arevamps the prison library, and even becomes the personal accountant to\u000athe\u000awarden, a cold man who, we learn, is just as criminal as any inmate.  Yet\u000aall the while, we don't realize just how smart Andy Dufresne is.  We\u000abelieve\u000ahe'll get his revenge on the legal system that landed him in jail, but\u000athis\u000amovie isn't about vengeance.  It's about making the most of a bad\u000asituation,\u000aand about the lengths a person will go to free himself-physically and\u000aspiritually.The film was nominated for seven Academy Awards in 1994 and lost all of\u000athem, mostly to Forrest Gump and Pulp Fiction (both solid films in their\u000aown\u000aright).  In any other year it may have won all seven.  Freeman definitely\u000adeserved every possible accolade for his performance, while Darabont's\u000adirection and Roger Deakins' stark cinematography bring great effect to\u000athe\u000astory.  The Shawshank Redemption is one of the most successful films ever\u000aon\u000avideo, and rightfully so.  It's one of the best films ever.\u000a\u000a

V\u000a\u000aAs a lover of film, I find it hard to remember my feelings regarding most\u000aof\u000athe films I ever seen. Not so with this film. This is your classic,\u000a'what's\u000athis mum you've got from the video shop, never heard of it, can't be arsed\u000ato watch it.' Ring any bells? I first saw this film about six years ago,\u000aand\u000aI remember as it neared the final scene on the beach, the tears in my\u000aeyes.\u000aIt is simply the most moving film I have ever seen, I think because this\u000ais\u000athe end we all wanted, but never thought possible. Both Tim Robbins and\u000aMorgan Freeman are brilliant, I think Freeman has the best voice-over tone\u000aaround. How this film did not win any Oscars is beyond me, it will always\u000abe\u000aone of my all-time favourite films, just brilliant. The line, 'Get busy\u000aliving, or get busy dying,' sums up the whole film, and it is a message\u000afor\u000aall; never give up hope for a redemption, and friendship will conquer all\u000atroubles.Anybody who hasn't seen this film, just go and see it for God's sake.\u000aAnybody who doesn't like it - you don't really like films do you? A tad\u000along\u000ais THE only minor criticism, but I think the length adds drama. You have\u000ato\u000asit down and watch this all the way through not in bits for the full\u000aeffect.Quite simply the best film I have ever, and will ever see.\u000a10/10.\u000a

Granted, in this\u000acase it required a number of years, a few laundryroom visits by the\u000asodomites and the execution of a key witness before the final crawl to\u000afreedom could take place. All in all a great movie with that Papillon good\u000afeeling of freedom at last. Love it I do.\u000a

V\u000aRating: **** out of ****For me, The Shawshank Redemption and Indiana Jones and the Last\u000aCrusade, two movies which have virtually nothing in common, have\u000aforever been ingrained as my favorite films of all-time. The reason:\u000aboth films represent the reasons why I watch movies in the first place.\u000aIn The Last Crusade's case, it's plain and simple fun escapism, and\u000anever has Hollywood movie magic achieved the rousing exhilaration that\u000athe third Indy movie has done for me.Then there's the other, more complex reason I see movies, to be\u000aenlightened, thought-provoked, challenged, and inspired, all of which\u000aThe Shawshank Redemption accomplishes and more. Back in 1994, I would\u000ahave thought someone was pulling my leg if they told me a prison drama\u000astarring Morgan Freeman and Tim Robbins (the latter of whom I had never\u000aeven heard of at the time) would endure as one of the most popular\u000afilms ever. Now, I'm just kicking myself for never having seen the film\u000ain theaters.Tim Robbins stars as Andy Dufresne, a banker who's been sentenced to\u000aconsecutive life terms in prison for the murder of his wife and her\u000alover. His first year is in 1947, and from this point on, we're\u000aintroduced to several other characters and situations over the many\u000ayears that pass, Dufresne's developing friendship with Red (Morgan\u000aFreeman), and his becoming a mentor to a hotheaded thief (Gil Bellows),\u000aall of which culminate to a masterful conclusion which sharply delivers\u000athe film's message.What is that message, you might ask? Why, it's all about hope, about\u000awhat we do with our lives. To most, living is hell, a harsh reality\u000athat involves pain and endurance. But if we take charge of our very own\u000aexistence, appreciate everything we have and can accomplish, then the\u000avery process of living can be wonderful. Even the most cynical people I\u000aknow still love this movie, a grand statement for just how powerfully\u000aeffective it is. The plot may not sound interesting to the uninitiated\u000a(take my word for it, I first saw this film when I was a 14-year old\u000awith the attention span of a fly, and the movie still gripped me like\u000ano other), but it fits perfectly with the themes at work, and much of\u000athe dialogue is so beautifully written, the film simply demands repeat\u000aviewings to gather it all.Frank Darabont adapted the script from Stephen King's novella, keeping\u000amuch of the story lines and dialogue verbatim, while making a few\u000acrucial changes, for the better, believe it or not. Darabont's\u000adirection is equally as terrific, keeping things low-key and seemingly\u000aunexceptional, but truly crafting something memorable and brilliant.\u000aThomas Newman's remarkable score is emotionally touching and uplifting,\u000aperfectly fitting with the movie's tone.But great as the direction and writing may be, what puts this over the\u000atop for me are the performances. Everyone here is excellent, without\u000athe slightest minor exception. Morgan Freeman and Tim Robbins deliver\u000athe best, most powerful performance of their careers in crafting two of\u000athe most memorable characters in cinema, with the former proving why\u000ahe's the greatest actor around and the latter showing why he's one of\u000athe more underrated performers. The film is primarily about the\u000afriendship between Dufresne and Red, how a man can bring hope to a\u000acynic in even a place as confined as Shawshank Penitentiary. In\u000asupporting turns, James Whitmore and William Sadler are exceptional as\u000aprisoners who befriend Dufresne. Sadler, in particular, begins the film\u000aas a total ass, and it's to his credit that by the end, his\u000atransformation to a genuinely likable character is entirely believable.\u000aEven Gil Bellows is excellent here, and anyone who's seen Ally Mcbeal\u000aknows he typically defines bland.The Shawshank Redemption's ending is, quite simply, fabulous.\u000aEverything about the final half-hour is perfect, from the big surprise\u000atwist to the pacing to the music to the acting right down to the very\u000afinal scene. I'm probably sounding a bit repetitive by now, but\u000aeverything about the conclusion (much as the rest of the film) is pure\u000agenius. There are flaws in The Shawshank Redemption, most particularly\u000awhy Bob Gunton and Clancy Brown never appear to age over the years that\u000ago by, but such a minor mistake isn't even worth muttering to the\u000aoverwhelmingly positive attributes the film bears. The Shawshank\u000aRedemption is the perfect film, and I'm absolutely certain nothing will\u000aever match it, much less surpass it.\u000a

V\u000a\u000aYou know, now that I think about it, I don't think there is more than one\u000awoman in this film.This is interesting, because the fact is: this is a guy movie. This is the\u000akind of movie a dad should watch with his son when he's having a hard time.\u000aThis is the movie a guy would not be ashamed to feel emotional about.It is the story of a man who goes to prison, but ends up coming out a better\u000aman because of his experiences. And it all ties together so nicely. The\u000aending is especially touching, even as it moves from the main character\u000a(Robins) to the supporting character/narrator (Freeman). BY the way, the\u000afilm was nominated for seven oscars and somehow didn't win any, which is a\u000atragedy.Every person in the world should see this film, even if you have to see it\u000aon TV, at least give it a shot, you will feel emotional at the end, but like\u000athe lead character, you will be better for it.10/10\u000a

V\u000a\u000a`The Shawshank Redemption' is a dramatic representation of how prison life\u000aaffects one inmate, Andy Dufresne (Tim Robbins).  In turn, how Andy uses\u000aresourcefulness and determination to affect a small group of what becomes\u000ahis closest friends, and ultimately how this affects the entire\u000aprison.\u000aSentenced for a crime he didn't commit and determined to survive in an\u000aunfriendly and unnatural environment, this white collared young man seeks\u000athe aid of Ellis `Red' Redding (Morgan Freeman), a man who can get stuff.\u000aRed is thrown off by the natural coldness of Andy and considers him a bit\u000aof\u000aan enigma.  Nonetheless, Red sticks with the young man and mentors him\u000athrough his first years.\u000aThe combination of Andy's resourceful nature and the will to survive gives\u000ahim a chance to use his financial savvy to get gain with the inmates and\u000athe\u000aguards.  This single event turns in to a continuous flow of opportunities.\u000aThis would land Andy and his crew in some of the easy time ever spent in\u000aShawshank.\u000aHaving proven his worth with the guards, he would begin to do business\u000awith\u000aone of the most corruptible men in the prison, Warden Norton (Bob Gunton).\u000aThis would give Andy the opportunities he would need to create a new\u000aenvironment in Shawshank.  By gaining as much trust as an inmate could,\u000aAndy\u000ais able to learn the system better than even the Warden himself .  Andy is\u000agiven the opportunity to build a library and educate the uneducated\u000ainmates\u000aof the prison.  The warden never expected any of it to work, but when it\u000adoes, he is there to receive the accolades.  In the end, Andy knows who is\u000aresponsible for the success of Shawshank, and this determination gives him\u000ahis freedom.\u000aThe struggle between Andy and Norton can be used as symbolism in our\u000aeveryday lives.  The battle between employee and employer, student and\u000ateacher, or child and parent, can find relation to this story.  The\u000arepresentations given in this film are all very comparable to those in\u000awhich\u000awe find in our lives everyday.  This is what makes the film so interesting\u000ato the audience.\u000aFrom the opening scene to the very last, I am held captive by this film.\u000aThere could not be a better group of actors to fill the roles and the\u000asetting is always perfect for the scene.  This is a movie we can watch\u000aover\u000aand over and always learn something new.  This film teaches\u000aresourcefulness,\u000apatience, perseverance, and determination.  Andy Dufresne will go down in\u000ahistory as a teacher of men and a beacon of hope.\u000a

V\u000a\u000aI don't think this movie is a the second best of all time. It is one of my\u000apersonal favorites and I can't think of any big flaws. Frank Darabont is\u000agreat behind the camera, and Robbins and Freeman are powerful in front of\u000ait. The writing is fine, with no cheesy lines to be found. Sure, the movie\u000ais on TV so much it makes me sick, but that's no reason to hate the movie.\u000aThat is, however a reason to hate TNT. This is a great movie that beats\u000aForrest Gump in it's sheer power. How Gump beat this movie in the 94\u000aOscars,\u000aI don't know. The real race was between Pulp Fiction and this. Simple vs.\u000aoriginal. That's how it should of been.    \u000a

V\u000a\u000aThe first time I've seen this movie was on December 31st, 2001. My\u000aparents\u000aand I were getting ready to down to the city and celebrate the New\u000aYear.My father said it was a great film and it was just on TNT or TBS. I\u000adecided\u000ato watch it, and wow. This has to be the greatest film of\u000aall-time.The acting was excellent, the directing, the writing. Everything. Morgan\u000aFreeman and Tim Robbins gave excellent jobs. On my all-time favorites\u000alist,\u000athis ranks #3...1. "Rat Race" (2001)\u000a2. "Catch Me If You Can" (2002)\u000a3. "The Shawshank Redemption" (1994)\u000a4. "Terminator 2: Judgment Day" (1991)\u000a5. "Spider-Man" (2002)The only bad aspect of the film was that the ending was too\u000aweak.SPOILER ALERTWhen Freeman's character met Robbin's character on the beach, it was just\u000adull. I don't even think they ever said a word. They just faded out.\u000aCouldn't they have shown what happens next? Oh, well.SPOILER ALERT OVER.Everything else was great and there were even some funny moments, like\u000awhen\u000athe Prison owner guy found out how Robbins' character left the\u000aprison.Since 12/31/01, I've seen the movie four more times, bought the\u000ascreenplay\u000aand bought the DVD.10/10\u000a

V\u000a\u000aThis movie was one that I initially missed out on.The film tells the tale of Andy Dufresne (Tim Robbins), a Executive at a\u000abank in the midst of the 20th century. Andy is sentenced to prison for the\u000amurder of his wife and her lover, where he meets "Red" or Ellis boyd\u000aRedding\u000a(Morgan Freeman) as his name is. Red is the one guy that every prison has\u000aat\u000aleast one of. The man you speak with if you want something from the\u000aoutside.Slowly but surely a friendship grows between them and we follow the story\u000aof\u000ahow Andy who shows to be a odd individual deals with his time in the\u000aprison,\u000aand repeatedly surprises his new "friends" who have yet to know his real\u000asecret...I'm really fairly sceptical about Dramas, but all i can say is...This movie was great. That's what I'll say about it, I really enjoyed the\u000agreat acting and lovely settings that really allowed you to feel as you\u000awere\u000aa part of the story being told. The characters are thought through, and\u000ayou'll be treated to both moments of true sorrow and moments of joy while\u000ahaving this cinematic experience.Even though I'd like to find a flaw to comment on, I can't say that I can.\u000aThe story has everything it needs and the movie truly earned it's ranking\u000aamong other films.9/10\u000a

V\u000a\u000aFrank Darabont is a genius.\u000aIn one of the most critically acclaimed, famous movies in Hollywood history,\u000athe director from France has created a work of art.\u000aSuperb performances from Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman carry the film\u000athroughout its fairly lengthy duration of 137 minutes smoothly. The film has\u000aa very slow pace, but somehow it is incredible absorbing, not boring in the\u000aslightest.\u000aThe story follows Andy Dufresne, (Tim Robbins), a young banker who, despite\u000aprotesting innocence, is jailed with back to back life sentences for killing\u000ahis wife and her lover that she ran away with.\u000aOnce at Shawshank Prison, he developes a friendship with Ellis Boyd Redding-\u000a"Red" (Morgan Freeman). Red is a man who "knows how to get things", i.e  he\u000asmuggles things in from the outside world. What unfolds is not what you\u000amight expect- it's not the kind of prison film that has a gritty, explicit\u000aview of the bad things that happen in prison. Whilst this is shown to a\u000acertain extent, its not as bad as it could be and the bad sides generally\u000acome from the corrupt screws rather than the cons. \u000aThis is a moral tale, as suggested by the tagline "Fear can hold you\u000aprisoner....hope can set you free". It's the kind of film that you can enjoy\u000aimmensely, watch again and again, and really take a message about life away\u000afrom.\u000a My favourite film, along with Pulp Fiction of the same year, I give it\u000a10/10\u000a

V\u000a\u000aContains Spoilers\u000a1.- The reason there was no racial tension was that in 1940-60s Maine,\u000athe\u000ablack population was less than 1%, in one of the most conservative\u000astates,\u000aso, no, there was not much racial tension; and so, after a month, Andy\u000aasks\u000ahim to get the hammer, he just didn't walk up to him the first day there.\u000aI\u000awas in lockup for a night in Louisville KY with 30 others and in an hour\u000aI\u000awas BSin with a homie who got popped with 6 ounces of blow.  I got nailed\u000afor not producing a valid license.(left it in the hotel).2.- All the relevant (except "the sisters") prisoners were criminals, and\u000adoing time, and were not saints.3.- Andy can get a REAL (not fake) driver's license and S.S. number for a\u000abogus identity. Granted this is a movie, but yes, you can get real\u000adocuments\u000aby mail. He was in prison for years before he started his phantom\u000aidentity,\u000ahe would have been able to ask any con for help. And THEIR picture would\u000anever end up on the license, because they didn't start putting photos on\u000alicenses until the 70s and 80s. This was the 40s - 60s, when white collar\u000acrime was just starting to expand.4.- He doesn't get gang-raped many times and doesn't end up traumatized.\u000aHe\u000afought them off.5.- A white yuppie banker can pull off what none of the lifers can? And\u000athe\u000a"he never lost hope" excuse don't cut it.  Because it's a\u000amovie.6.- The prison guards NEVER once open up his books (where he kept the\u000arock\u000ahammer). At any prison of medium security the raids include the books as\u000awell, never mind a maximum security facility.  Because it's a\u000amovie.7.- Red remembers Andy's instructions EXACTLY, even when these were told\u000ato\u000ahim only once and at a relaxed, casual moment. And after months, the\u000aplace\u000aAndy described remained THE SAME. Remember Andy told him right before he\u000aescaped and Red was paroled soon after.What bothers me about bad reviews is distorting the facts to make up the\u000abad\u000areview.\u000a

V\u000a\u000aThe Shawshank Redemption is not only the greatest film of the last decade,\u000abut in time, this may become, in the eyes of moviegoers, the best movie ever\u000amade.  The story of wrongfully accussed banker Andy Dufresne, and his\u000afriendship formed with con Ellis Boyd Redding in Shawshank Prison, has\u000abecome as universally acclaimed and loved as any other in recent history. \u000aThis is the 'Casablanca' of it's time.  A near-perfect movie that can be\u000awatched hundreds of times and never lose it's impact.  Perhaps its the way\u000athe movie handles the timeless theme of hope, and the trials one man has to\u000aendure to be attain the proverbial redemption of the title.  Maybe it is\u000abecause this movie is truth, simple truth, about the triumph of good over\u000aevil, the triumph of reason over madness, the triumph of hope over\u000aeverything.\u000a

V\u000a\u000aWhat is so special about this movie? Thats what I asked myself when I saw\u000ait\u000aas one of the few IMDB top-rated movies I didn't know yet. Now I know why\u000ait\u000adeserves to be there. It is the best prison movie ever made. Most prison\u000amovies try to accuse the prison system by showing an increasing level of\u000aviolence and spectacular escapes. Shawshank Redemption is somewhat\u000adifferent. The main actor is portrayed from the view of a second person\u000aand\u000amost of the time we see what this person sees. Shawshank prison is not a\u000amonastery, and while there are some violent scenes, most of the violence\u000awe\u000aonly learn by the narrative of the second person. The time saved from\u000adepicting violence is spent showing the feelings of the inmates. Beyond\u000athe\u000aperfect technical work in producing this movie, the plot slowly builds up\u000ato\u000aincredible moments of courage and purity. I guess this is what essentially\u000amakes the movie so great, without being pathetic the movie makes us wonder\u000aabout our own motives and decisions. Very thought provoking.\u000a

V\u000a\u000aNamely: I liked that movie. Many people love it. I just like it. I like it VERY much.Especially I like Tim Robbins. But the story is just mediocrate. Anyway, the\u000adirector is very good and along with Tim and Freeman he is getting us\u000ainvolved. Few are critical, as usual, saying that there are used too many\u000astereotypes, but what the heck - in this case!!! - it´s a brilliant movie\u000aanyway! Maybe it´s overrated and deserveres to be on 51th of the best movies\u000aof all time. Then what to do about Memento and LTOTR?? Do you want do put on\u000aa test on voters? Make them see true art as Bergmann, Hitchcock, Lubitsch,\u000aWilder, Griffith, Ford, Capra, Zinneman, Coppola, Scorsese, Besson and\u000aStroheim produced it frequently? No! It´s the sign of the times. The\u000aInternet is (still) "new" and the people who are using it are young or at\u000atheir best in their middle ages. So let´s take their voting as what it is: a\u000apicture ot our own time. And be fair. If the younger generation likes it -\u000athey may be right!After all: I REALLY liked it. 9/10 Macaulay J.

V\u000a\u000aThe Shawshank Redemption was story about how perseverance, hope and\u000ainnocence\u000awill change a man's destiny. Tim Robbins was eloquent and portrayed a\u000acharacter with acting prowess of razor sharp perfection. Wrongly accused\u000aof\u000amurdering his wife, he ends up in Shawshank Maximum Security Prison, for\u000alife. Here here he befriends Red, played by Morgan Freeman ( a role he\u000adefinitely deserved the Best Supporting Actor Oscar ), your typical Jack\u000aof\u000aall traits in the prison. Their story was one of trust, hope and\u000afriendship\u000awhich was ultimately the forte of this movie.\u000aRobbins acting was methodical, straight-foward and deservingly captures\u000aour\u000asympathy. A great supporting cast also gives added strength to an already\u000aperfect movie. The background music score haunts me even until today as\u000ait\u000asuccessfully depicts the sad, helpless and claustrophobic mood of a\u000amaximum\u000asecurity prison.\u000aRich, crisp and vibrant cinematography together with Director Frank\u000aDarabont's vivid imagination and direction style  brought to life one of\u000athe\u000agreatest motion picture ever told! 10/10\u000a

V\u000a\u000a*** SPOILERS ***\u000aI just finished watching Shawshank for the third time. Even though I know\u000aexactly what's going to happen in every part of the movie, some scenes are\u000aso beautiful and powerful that they still make me cry. The first 30 minutes\u000aof the film feels like a normal prison film, nothing special, but a good\u000abuild up for things to come. The film really starts taking off with the\u000ascene where they work on the roof. After that it just gets better and\u000abetter. In the end you are overwhelmed with the beauty of this\u000amovie.My favourite parts are when they are working in the roof, when Brooks is\u000areleased, when Tommy gets shot in the yard, the part where Red describes how\u000aAndy escaped and the part where Red find the note under the rock. Every\u000ascene in the movie is great and most of them are relevant to the main story.\u000aThe narration by Freeman is great, I can't think of any other film that\u000acontains so many wonderful quotes. The music is also beautiful and fits\u000aperfectly into the movie.It's very hard to tell with words how good this movie is. Just go watch the\u000amovie and hopefully you will feel the same things I feel.\u000a\u000a

V\u000a\u000aThere are only a few movies that command your attention no matter when you\u000acome across them. This is one of them. If it is on TV and I am scanning the\u000achannels, once I hit this movie I MUST stay till the end. I must have seen\u000ait at lest a dozen times now.Here are some stray thoughts on "Shawshank" It contains the most beautiful narration job (Morgan Freeman) that I have\u000aever heard. I could listen to it alone with no pictures and it would shine! This movie holds some kind of record for small moments that are HUGELY\u000amemorable. e.g. Andy plays the opera record....beers in the sun....Brooks\u000aand his bird....Billy gets shot....Andy in the rain....Morgan Freeman in the\u000afield finding Andy's "treasure"....the gorgeous Blue Pacific ending....and\u000athere are so many more. There may be some movies made that are as good as this one but I can't\u000aimagine any being better.\u000a

And nowhere I can\u000aremember, can it conclusively prove that Andy Dufrene did NOT kill his\u000awife\u000aand that Glen geezer. All we have to go on is him saying that he didn't\u000aand\u000athe fact that we all like him as a character. Yes it does seem against\u000ahis\u000anature, but a lot of murders must be against peoples nature's, but they\u000astill happen.Anyone else agree that he could be the killer?\u000a

V\u000a\u000aNot long ago, maybe a year or two I was sitting watching the tube when I\u000aheard that that "The Shawshank Redemption" was on that evening.  The first\u000athing that comes to mind is, (and which I regret very much)  "It's the other\u000aprison movie Stephen King wrote".  I had never seen The Green Mile, but here\u000ain Canada it got loads of publicity, I had mildly heard of The Shawshank\u000aRedemption, but I didn't know it's story, so I tuned in...I was blown away! \u000aAlot of people on imbd are saying every minute is worth watching you will\u000alove every second and want more and more-that's not true, sometimes you see\u000aso much that you just can't handle another person dying, or being raped,\u000awe're only human.  If you think the whole movie is amazing, you are very\u000apatient.  Sure, the first time you see it you get that impression but the\u000asecond time you long to see the ending.  If you only had time to watch a\u000ahalf an hour or so, the beginning or the ending is the part to tune into. \u000aThe beginning (the first night in jail) is outstanding!  When the man nobody\u000aknows wails the first night he's in the slammer and dies the next day you\u000aare blown away with impressions of the guards and prisoners. And the ending, (when Red is explaining Andy's escape) is outstanding how\u000asmart Andy truely is!  I won't spoil the ending for you if you've seen it\u000ayou can assume and recall how amazing and thought provoking it is, and if\u000ayou haven't seen it, this leaves an element of surprise.  If The Green Mile\u000awas this good it maybe about time I look in to it.  \u000a

V\u000a\u000aShawshank Redemption is a compelling, moving, and beautiful story which is\u000adarkly funny at times. This movie's #2 spot on IMDB is debatable, since it\u000ais essentially a formulaic Hollywood story with Hollywood characters...\u000ai.e.\u000aevil institution (guards) and noble rebels ("some" prisoners) within a\u000amicrocosm (prison). Andy Dufresne is so incredibly friggin' smart (for a\u000abanker) that is almost super-hero like. Though this is definitely a worthy\u000afilm, in terms of sheer greatness, Shawshank missed Cool Hand Luke by\u000a*this\u000amuch*... If you want a really top-of-the-line awesome prison movie, Cool\u000aHand Luke is the one to see.\u000a

V\u000a\u000aThere are so many facets to this film, both subtle and obvious. You\u000areally\u000aneed to see it multiple times to appreciate them all. Several reviews\u000ahave\u000atried to boil this movie down into a few phrases, usually not doing it\u000ajustice. This movie is about the growing and intimate friendship of the\u000atwo\u000amain characters, and is possibly the best male friendship movie ever\u000amade.If only Steven King would stick to movies like this and Stand By Me,\u000ainstead\u000aof the supernatural horror films. His story-telling prowess is\u000aunmatched.Morgan Freeman once again shows his incredible abilities, and this\u000aperformance ranks with his great portrayal in Glory! He has an uncanny\u000aknack\u000afor helping you know a character better than it's screentime should\u000aallow.\u000aYou just know who Red is in this film, in your heart.HBO's showing several years ago included a couple of cut-out scenes that\u000awere fantastic, and are worth looking for if you like this\u000amovie.\u000a\u000a

V\u000a\u000aNo spoilers here.A remarkable Stephen King penned story.  King has often found ways of\u000agetting to wonder about even our most strongly held values.  Most\u000aconsider\u000apeople in prison as throwaway members of society, and those that guard\u000athe\u000aprisons as public servants. King twists this into the protagonist\u000aprisoner\u000a(Robbins) against the hopelessness of prison and the brutal display of\u000apower\u000aby the warden.  The story is beautifully narrated by Morgan Freeman as\u000aex-con Red.It lost out to Tom Hanks' portrayal of Forrest Gump for Best Picture,\u000awhich\u000ais a shame, but I'll never forget the impact it made on\u000ame.The film has an edge, and a heart.

V\u000a\u000aFirst things first...\u000aThis is my favorite movie of all time.  Therefore, I was disturbed to see\u000aa\u000afew reviews claiming that this movie isn't all that great.  Having only a\u000afew college credits remaining until I obtain a degree in Critical Film\u000aAnalysis, I have studied this film numerous times and can tell you just\u000awhy\u000ait is so great.\u000aFirst off, I read from another review that it was horrible because it was\u000aa\u000afirst-time director.  That just happens to be one reason why the film is\u000aso\u000agreat to begin with.  The director is passionate about the project since\u000ait\u000ais his first, and Darabont's passion is displayed magnificently in this\u000afilm.  The same goes for Kevin Costner (Dances With Wolves) and Sam Mendes\u000a(American Beauty).  Both were first time directors and as a matter of fact\u000aboth won Oscars for their Best Picture winning "first timers."The other unlogical argument against this film that I read was about how\u000a"plain" it was.  Heaven forbid that there is no computer enhanced bullets\u000aflying by a body being covered by dozens upon dozens of cameras (The\u000aMatrix)\u000aor some cheesy George Lucas characters that have no bearing on a story.\u000aThe\u000aShawshank Redemption is far from a plain movie though.  The camera work IS\u000aamazing, just look at the scene where Andy is about to be pushed off of\u000athe\u000aroof that the inmates are tarring.  That was pulled off WITHOUT a computer\u000aat all.\u000aAnother argument that I heard: The story is too plain.  Well I'm sorry\u000athat\u000athere is no Hans Solo pressing the *fill in the blank* button that will\u000alift\u000athe *fill in the blank* to stop the *fill in the blank* from attacking the\u000aplanet of *fill in the blank* that is inhabited by the *fill in the blank*\u000arace.  The Shawshank Redemption is as real as it gets.  Why introduce\u000atwenty\u000amillion characters just for the shear joy of it?  Darabont shows more\u000aemotion with Red and Andy than any other director that I have seen\u000a(possibly\u000aSam Mendes may be better by a short bit).\u000aWithout getting too much further into the film I'll just stop by saying\u000athat\u000aif you haven't seen The Shawshank Redemption there is a reason why it is\u000a#2\u000aon the IMDB top 250 list.  A good movie is enjoyable to watch, but a great\u000amovie will get you lost within the film and open a entire new world that\u000ayou\u000amight never experience.  You will lose yourself in the Shawshank\u000aRedemption.\u000a**I also recommend another Stephen King/Frank Darabont film: The Green\u000aMile.\u000a

There is no facetious acting\u000aand even the scenes where Andy is violated by the `sisters'  there are no\u000agrisly scenes but still the viewer is left in no doubt what took place.\u000asome\u000apeople call it bland but to me it adds to the appeal  of the film and\u000ain-keeping with time scale the film was set in.This story appeals on so many levels and I can see why its in the top ten\u000afilms in IMDB and the tag line It takes a strong man to save himself, and\u000aa\u000agreat man to save another completely captures the film essence and I know\u000ait\u000awill not be 8 years before I watch it again. But having to wait years to\u000awatch it I must qualify for the sadster of the year award\u000a!!9/10\u000a\u000a

V\u000a\u000aCONTAINS SPOILERS\u000aReview by Joe:\u000a`Rita Hayworth and the Shawshank Redemption' the original short\u000anovel by legendary author Stephen King, sparked the start of a superb\u000amovie\u000aand ongoing legend.\u000aAndrew Dufresne, a fairly young man committed murder and was sentenced to\u000alife in Shawshank prison.  There are some elements of this film that\u000adiffer\u000afrom elements of this novel.  And yet many things are the same.In the novel, Andy was a short, partially bald man, who was quiet and\u000ashy,\u000aand in the movie he was a tall intimidating stocky figure.  I think this\u000adifference is important in one particular scene: the prisoners are\u000atarring\u000athe roof, and Andy overhears Hadley, a man who is angry at the world,\u000atalking about his inheritance from his deceased brother.  Andy speaks up\u000aabout the taxes of the inheritance and Hadley gets furious.  I think that\u000aif\u000ain the movie he was the man described in the book, it would have made\u000athis\u000aseem weak, and Hadley probably wouldn't have thought him worthy to even\u000aspeak to him.\u000aI think this movie was put together well, but to be honest, I like\u000aStephen\u000aKing's short novel better.Review by Steve:\u000aThe movie was very good.  Andy's life in prison was real.  Andy really\u000agot\u000acheated out of 20 years of his life.  Andy's in jail for something he\u000adidn't\u000ado.\u000aI especially like the scene when the warden was talking to the media.\u000aWhen\u000athe warden was in front of the building talking it looked like the warden\u000ahad a crown on.  Showing that he was a king he had all the\u000apower.\u000aI didn't like the ending of the movie.  It was good for them because it\u000awas\u000awhat they both wanted. They both wanted freedom and that's what that\u000ascene\u000ashowed.  But they should have had some sort of action, like gone sailing,\u000afishing, showed them both out to sea doing something.  Being free.  Not\u000ajust\u000aon the beach hugging each other.Review by Derek:\u000aI think that the directors should have filmed the movie in Charleston,\u000aMaine because I've spent a lot of time there.  I wish I would have had a\u000achance to see the whole movie but from what I saw it was a great movie.\u000aI\u000aliked the movie cause it seemed so real.  But what I didn't like was how\u000athe\u000aguards and the warden thought that any one who got in the way or their\u000abusiness they could kill them or put them in solitary confinement.  Plus\u000aI\u000adidn't like how guards treated inmates like slaves. They couldn't just\u000aface\u000areality and treat them like equals. But it happens in prisons all over\u000athe\u000aworld so that's why I liked Shawshank Redemption.Review by Brad:\u000aI liked the movie compared to the book.  I think that the movie was way\u000abetter. The movie seemed to be way more interesting.  It was\u000acomplimentary\u000ato Stephen King's ways of writing an intricate portrayal of an actual\u000aevent\u000athat took place in Maine.\u000aOne of the things I liked about the movie is the way camera angles\u000aportray\u000apower.Review by Dan:\u000aA Review of Shawshank Redemption from an Inmate's View\u000aI found the movie not nearly as enjoyable as Stephen King's `Rita\u000aHayworth\u000aand the Shawshank Redemption'.  The points I found I did not agree with\u000aare\u000athey have Red's character as a black man in the movie when in the short\u000astory he was a white Irish man but it kinda adds a little laughter to a\u000aserious theme.  Second they have Andy Dufresne as a tall skinny man when\u000ain\u000a`Rita Hayworth.' he's a small and a heavy man with not much of an aura.\u000aThirdly they have one warden Mr. Norton when there is three in the short\u000astory because it seems to the viewer that 19 years did not go by, but in\u000aa\u000away its good so the viewer can focus his hate towards one figure. That's\u000awhat I didn't like but there are more pros than cons.  The film makers\u000adid\u000aan excellent job with the lighting, the angle of the camera and the\u000amusic.\u000aWith these three combined it gives the feelings of dread and despair as\u000ablack as death.  Freedom as high as a bird and sadness as deep as an\u000aocean.\u000aWith all these in mind it makes a great movie on a scale from 1 to 10 I'd\u000agive it 8 ½.Review by Chris:\u000aThis movie was madcool. Some specific parts about this movie that I\u000athought\u000awere pretty phat was like when the music was played by the Italian lady's\u000asinging and they all looked free.  When later on in the movie the music\u000ais\u000areally fast and strong after he's finished climbing out of the pipe and\u000areally is free.  I also like how Andy never gave up against the sisters\u000aand\u000athen finally Hadley beat the p*** out of Boggs,the guards helped him\u000abecause\u000ahe helped them that's pretty killer.Madcool-really good, very interesting\u000aPhat-cool interesting, awesome, madcool\u000aPretty Killer-same\u000a

V\u000aCONTAINS SPOILERS!!!!!!\u000aFrank Darabont's brilliant adaptation form the Stephen King novel\u000aDifferent\u000aSeasons, "The Shawshank Redemption" captures the audience's attention and\u000adoes not let go.  As in "The Green Mile", Darabont takes us through a\u000ajourney of an innocent man confined to prison walls.  The film begins\u000awith\u000aAndy Dufresne  (Tim Robbins)  being found guilty of two counts of murder\u000aand\u000ashipped off to Shawshank Prison.  There we meet Red Redding (Morgan\u000aFreeman).  Andy and Red begin a memorable friendship that is evident\u000athough\u000aout the film.  The corrupt warden (Bob Gunton) makes Andy's life\u000amiserable.\u000aOver the years, we see Andy growing, getting books for the prison\u000alibrary,\u000aand teaching his follow inmates.  We see Red going to the parole board\u000aand\u000anever allowed freedom.  Darbont has the audience hoping that he is\u000afinally\u000agoing to be released.  More years past and Andy decides to get busy dying\u000aor\u000aget busy living.  Suddenly, we hear sirens going off and the warden\u000ashooting\u000ahimself for a cowardly way out for his dirty deeds.  Andy escapes.  But\u000ahow\u000adoes he do it?  Telling us how Andy crawls his way to freedom, Red begins\u000ato\u000anarrate the rest of the film.\u000aAfter nineteen years, Andy obtains his revenge and freedom at the same\u000atime.  The steps at which Andy takes to escape leaves the audience\u000aspeechless.  Red begins to miss his friend and every once in awhile he\u000awould\u000aget a plain postcard, which we all knew was from Andy.  Red is once again\u000asent before the parole board.  He tells them what he thinks of them.\u000aThey\u000afinally parole him.   The audience can not get any happier.  Andy and Red\u000aare free.  Yet Andy told Red about a place he loved to go the night\u000abefore\u000ahe escaped.  Red hitchhikes to that place and finds a tin box.  Inside\u000athe\u000aold wore out box is money and the place Red could find Andy.  Red takes a\u000abus to a beautiful place by the ocean.  As Red walks the beach, we see\u000aAndy.\u000aThe film is long but, the time flies because the audience is into the\u000amovie.  The performances of Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman are\u000aphenomenal.\u000a"The Shawshank Redemption" is one film a person can keep watching because\u000aeveryone always finds themselves still rooting for Andy who finally got\u000abusy\u000aliving.\u000a\u000a

V\u000a\u000aOne of the ways that I figure out if a movie is really good or not is by\u000awatching it several times and seeing if it keeps my interest.Some movies are just good movies with people that you associate with and\u000alike to be around.  "Forrest Gump".Some movies make you envy the star or the character and make you a better\u000aperson for the watching (Gary Cooper in High Noon).Some movies are just cool (Pulp Fiction).This movie is one you want to watch because you feel the respect between\u000atwo\u000amen,  the determination of one man, and the power of friendship.\u000aWatching\u000aTim Robbins and Morgan Freeman develop their relationship over the course\u000aof\u000a20+ years is a journey you don't want to miss and a journey that you\u000aenjoy\u000aseeing over and over again.  The grit and determination to survive in a\u000aworld that was so alien to Andy is a revelation on the human spirit.Finally the friendship that Andy and Red developed, kept Red from\u000acommitting\u000aanother crime just to go back to something safe and familiar.  This is a\u000atestimony to the ability for one man to truly change the life of another.\u000aThis is one of the three best movies of the 90's and one of the best\u000afilms\u000aof all time.\u000a

V\u000a"The Shawshank Redemption" is one of my favorite films. It was filmed in and\u000aaround where I live (in Ohio), and I have actually visited the old prison\u000awhere they shot much of the movie. I would love to know where they filmed\u000athe scene where Andy buried the letter and money in that countryside. It\u000alooks very familiar.  Anyway, I thought Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman were\u000aat their best, and had great chemistry together. The casting, so important\u000ato making a film work, was well done.  Bob Gunton ,as the warden, does a\u000agreat job. There is something intriging about escaping from a hopeless\u000asituation and changing your destiny. This is the first Steven King work I\u000ahave actually enjoyed. Also, the background music really adds to the overall\u000aenjoyment and quality of the film. I am glad to see it is also considered\u000aone of the greatest films of all times by others.\u000a

V\u000a\u000aI'd like to remind those few Nay Sayers that have labeled SSR as an\u000aoverrated film that it sure wasn't overrated by the Academy in 1994. In\u000afact, it didn't win a single Oscar! Thanks to IMDB, the public has spoken\u000a-it's truly a People's Choice! Obviously, we each have a right to our\u000aopinion, and I respect (though cannot understand) the opinions of those\u000athat\u000ahave expressed dissent about the film. Rather than remain in a quandary\u000aas\u000ato how it could have been elevated to number 2 all-time, perhaps you\u000ashould\u000atry watching the film again to see if, by chance, you missed the boat on\u000ait\u000athe first time around. There's no vote-fixing going on here, folks! I\u000astand\u000ain harmony among those who have been enlightened by this masterpiece and\u000alend my hand in lifting it to the top.\u000a

V\u000a\u000aAn excellent tale about enduring incredibly adversity and eventually\u000atriumphing.  The incomparable Morgan Freeman sets the tone as narrator.\u000aThis should not be seen as a "prison" movie, even though it is set in a\u000aprison.  Tim Robbins, as the other major character and the man whose\u000atrials\u000arival those of Job, is a good everyman.  When this film was nominated for\u000aa\u000alot of Oscars, Kathie Lee Gifford made a great show of ridiculing its\u000atitle\u000a(on "Live with Regis and...").

V\u000a\u000aI enjoyed this film but it is very derivative and is not the profound\u000amasterpiece people here seem to think it is. The problem is that people\u000aeither have a short memory or don't bother to watch older films because\u000athey\u000aare not in colour or have unfamiliar actors. People are especially lazy\u000aabout foreign films and find reading subtitles irritating. "The Birdman\u000aFrom\u000aAlcatraz" is a much finer movie in virtually every way - Hanks simply\u000adoes\u000anot have the gravitas of Lancaster. To prattle on about this being some\u000agreat movie shows a complete ignorance of films. Great film-makers are\u000aTarkovsky, Kurosawa, Fellini, Bergman, Truffaut etc etc. "Shawshank" is\u000avery\u000atargeted at middle-of-the-road America (which includes the UK as we have\u000abeen thoroughly burgerised by your so-called culture) which goes down\u000agreat\u000awith a cola and a bucket of popcorn. It is a very old-fashioned film\u000awhich\u000areminded me of the classics of US movies like "The Grapes of Wrath" and\u000athose Cagney films where he goes mad in solitary. I think these polls are\u000aok\u000abut all we end up with is the most popular films at this present time. In\u000a10\u000ayears time this film will be forgotten as the next popcorn-pleaser takes\u000aover. For years I couldn't understand what the academics were going on\u000aabout\u000awith films by Antonioni or Eisenstein. But I made the effort and over\u000atime I\u000acame to realise that the profs knew what they were talking about. I have\u000aa\u000alist of films here which I hope some of you "Shawshank" fans will\u000aeventually\u000awork through. "Death in Venice", "The Seven Samurai", "To Live", "Wild\u000aStrawberries", "Jules et Jim", "Andrei Rublev", "Grand Hotel", "8 1/2"...\u000aI\u000aam sure you can find more in this website. "Shawshank" is a nice little\u000afilm, but you are being spoonfed. Stretch yourself - there is a whole big\u000amovie world out there way beyond the confines of today's Hollywood. If\u000ayou\u000ago on this journey in a few years time you will hardly remember this\u000afilm.\u000a

V\u000a\u000aFor me this film is about as close to perfection as I can imagine. Somehow\u000aa\u000afirst time director's adaptation of a fairly average and forgotten novella\u000aby a horror writer has turned out to be one of the most beloved movies\u000aever\u000amade. Watching this film is truly a magical and life affirming experience,\u000awhich profoundly affected me after seeing it for the first time. Andy's\u000ajourney as he crawls through "a river of s*** and comes out clean on the\u000aother side" as red puts it, has become an inspiration to millions of\u000apeople.\u000aThe film's central message, that hope can lead us by the hand through the\u000adarkest times in our lives, and give us the courage to go on, is surely\u000aone\u000aof the most eloquent and beautiful sentiments ever delivered through the\u000amedia of cinema.\u000aThis film has become a modern phenomenon, a cultural benchmark, and has\u000aproved the incredible power that movies still posses.\u000a

V\u000a\u000athis movie has it all.  it has an exraordinary plot and the storyline\u000abetween morgan freeman and tim robbins is one that i have never seen\u000abefore.\u000ano movie has a "buddy to buddy" relationship as in this movie.  this\u000amovie\u000amade me cry at the end, although to be honest, it was kidna predictable\u000ahow\u000ahe would redeem himself.  the ending was also predictiable, but still, why\u000adoes a movie not have to be predictable to be great?  being predicatble\u000amakes the viewer happy that the movie is headed in a happy\u000adirection.\u000a

V\u000a\u000aWARNING:***SPOILERS THROUGHOUT***\u000aDO NOT READ IF YOU HAVEN'T SEEN THE MOVIEI originally rented this film because I had read it was an escape movie. \u000aThat was all I had really heard about it.  The title didn't seem very\u000afamiliar to me, but I thought I would rent it.  I was slightly worried that\u000aI had ruined the ending for myself, but I was worrying for nothing.  From\u000athe very first scene the movie had me.  Morgan Freeman's performance was\u000aPERFECT.  The music was great.  The plot was surprisingly varied and it\u000apulled me in.  And  of course the escape scene was the most uplifting thing\u000aI've ever seen in a movie anywhere.  The plot is so simple.  A man beats the\u000asystem.  It affects anyone who is human.  If you have disregarded my warning\u000aand are reading it without seeing it, don't worry.  I haven't ruined it. \u000aThis is one movie that has to be experienced.  There is absolutely nothing\u000aelse I can say.  Those of you have seen it will know what I'm talking about.\u000a It seems like I'm at a loss for words, and that's true.  Everyone must see\u000athis movie.  If you haven't seen it, stop reading, go out, and rent it or\u000abuy it or borrow it or steal it or download it-just see it.  This is worth\u000aany rental price.  It sounds simplistic to the point of irrevelence.  It\u000asounds like any other movie.  It sounds boring.  BUT ITS NOT.  It's\u000abeautiful!  It's perfect!  My writing skills are usually much better than\u000athis, but I can't fit this movie into words.  JUST SEE IT. NOW.  "Get busy\u000aliving, or get busy dying..."\u000a

V\u000a\u000aI saw this movie yesterday again. First time I saw it I was 13, and I had\u000aalready loved it. The pleasure and sensations felt while watching this\u000apicture are difficult to describe. It had been a long time since I had\u000alast\u000afelt this way about a movie. I was completely submersed in the plot, all\u000amy\u000amind concentrated in the facts of the movie. One loses connection with\u000areality and, for some time, one's life disappears and the movie becomes\u000aone's life. This is the sign that indicates us that we are in presence of\u000aa\u000agreat masterpiece. The plot is a beautiful story about hope, freedom and\u000afriendship. The cast couldn't be better: both Tim Robbins and Morgan\u000aFreeman\u000a(one of the greatest actors of all time, when are they going to give him\u000aan\u000aOscar?) are superb in the leading roles. Supporting cast is great too,\u000aespecially veteran James Whitmore. Thomas Newton composed the music, which\u000aperfectly supports the scenes in an extremely subtle, but at the same time\u000aincredibly effective way. It brings sensibility to the images without\u000ausing\u000asentimental tricks. And this is one of the great qualities of the movie:\u000ait's moving and evocative, without ever being sentimental. Sentimental\u000amusic\u000acould have ruined the movie, but Thomas Newman made a great job. The\u000adirector of photography is Roger Deakins, who has already astonished us\u000awith\u000athe amazing black and white photography of "The man who wasn't there". A\u000amasterpiece.\u000a\u000a

V\u000a\u000aThere is something in each one of us, which nobody can touch, defile or\u000apollute. That is our sacred place where resides our strength, hopes,\u000adreams\u000aand character.What this movie amazingly shows us is that it is possible to access our\u000astrength and keep alive our hopes when situations would otherwise defeat\u000aus.I have seen Shawshank 3 times over a span of 8 years. I can't see it again\u000aand again as it hurts...it's so perfect. When I viewed the movie for the\u000afirst time, all by myself, it was on a cold winter morning. Who would go\u000aand\u000asee a movie 9 am on a regular working/week day (college, actually)? But\u000athe\u000ainternational film festival was on in my city and it was the last\u000ascreening\u000aof the movie in the festival. So I missed some lectures, rode through the\u000amorning fog, and sat long after the projector was switched off in the\u000atheater to an incredible movie experience. The press and public had given\u000athe Shawshank a standing ovation that day.And I was aching to share it. So saw the movie again, once with my father\u000aand once recently with my husband.Just now when I happened to see the Top movies listed on IMDb and that\u000aShawshank is listed at no.2, I was hit by the memory of that cold winter\u000amorning.And when I clicked away and read other viewers comments, I noticed how\u000amajority of them remember vividly the how, when and where they had seen\u000athis\u000afilm for the first time. For most, like me, it was an unforgettable\u000athing.Just wanted to applaud the voters at IMDb to give Shawshank the right spot\u000aon all time top movies. I went and registered with the web site right now,\u000ajust that I too could add a vote in its favor.9 out of 10!\u000a\u000a

V\u000a   ***SPOILERS***    ***SPOILERS***\u000aImagine me as an old man with a beard sitting on the stoep (porch) waving\u000amy\u000acane at people passing by."How dare you call the Shawshank Redemption an unorginal prison fairytale!\u000aIt is not supposed to be a run of the mill prison movie. Its not supposed\u000ato\u000abe The Birdman of Alcatraz! It's not supposed to be MIDNIGHT EXPRESS! It's\u000anot even supposed to be Stir Crazy, you wippersnappers! The prison is only\u000athe backdrop! It's about overcoming the odds when you are at your rope's\u000aend. This is a movie about hope and finding it in the darkest and\u000adreariest\u000aof places."This movie could easily have been set in Nazi Germany in opressed\u000aGermany,\u000ain a concentration camp, in a 19th century work house! It's about breaking\u000afree from things that oppress us needlessly! (Spoiler starts here) Andy is\u000athe only person in prison that doesn't belong there! If he had done\u000asomething bad he would have accepted it, but he didn't, so he tunnels\u000athrough a wall to freedom. (Spoiler ends here)."Sentimentalism can be bad in a movie if handled incorrectly, but Darabont\u000auses it better than other Capra impersonators out there (even beating the\u000aCoens with their Hudsucker Proxy). And there is nothing wrong with\u000asentimentality in The Shawshank Redemption. And I can't see what cliches\u000ayou\u000aare talking about.

V\u000a\u000aAn excellent adaption of Stephen King's novella "Rita Hayworth and the\u000aShawshank Redemption".Morgan Freeman is outstanding and his narrative is very lulling and makes\u000athe film all the more compelling.Tim Robbins, too, gives a fantastic performance - and the supporting cast\u000a(particularly Bob Gunton as the sadistic warden; he also appeared in the\u000aKing adaption "Dolores Claiborne" (1995)) give fine performances,\u000atoo.Despite being riddled with prison cliches, this movie is\u000agreat.And remember: FEAR CAN KEEP YOU PRISONER, HOPE CAN SET YOU\u000aFREE.\u000a

V\u000a\u000aThe Shawshank Redemption is a harrowing and a much better film than I\u000aexpected.It is about a man who is framed for a murder he didn't commit and\u000ais sentenced to a life sentence in jail.While in jail,he befriends a\u000ablackman in which they help each other through the tough events that are\u000apursued.Clancy Brown stars as the evil guard who gives a brutal\u000aperformance.The whole film works beautifully and works itself into a disturbing but\u000astate of the art film and you will enjoy it.It was over a year ago I watched\u000athis,and I havn't forgotten it.\u000aIf you want something better,watch The Green Mile,you'll love\u000ait.\u000a

V\u000a\u000aWell, AT LAST I watched this movie! I'm very sorry I heard so much\u000arecommendations and comments about it, it was almost as bad as having plot\u000aspoilers. My expectations were just too high, even though it IS one of the\u000amost beautiful movies I've ever seen. I won't say much about it, what can I\u000asay? Just to repeat what other have said before - yes, it's very emotive\u000a(but not a tear-jerker... I didn't cry at all, I don't know why and where\u000apeople cried). it's captivating. it's riveting. and so\u000aon...Oh, and one more thing - many people compare Shawshank to Green Mile - but\u000ait's NOTHING like it! These are two COMPLETELY DIFFERENT movies! in my\u000aopinion it's a big mistake to compare them, if you do it you do them both an\u000ainjustice! They both outstanding, each one in its OWN way!\u000aAnd speaking of the Green Mile - I think it was as believable as Shawshank.\u000aThat's really how I felt, even though Shawshank is realistic and Green Mile\u000ais the exact opposite...Anyway, that's my opinion.. I give "The Shawshank Redemption"\u000a9.8/10\u000a

V\u000a\u000aTo really appreciate this one, you cannot simply watch it once and put it\u000aback on the shelf. Instead, the first time you should watch it for\u000aenjoyment, the second time to really get the raw sensation. Every time\u000aafter\u000athat is just the biggest thrill.The first time I watched this movie, I fell in love with it. But, it wasn't\u000auntil the second time that I really appreciated it for all it's subtle\u000aovertones. Only then does reality slap you in the face and give you the\u000awake-up call you've been needing.It is the type of film that allows you to try on someone else's shoe. You\u000aare exposed to a way of life which most of us will never understand and end\u000aup experiencing a really heart-felt moral joyride.And to top it all off, you have Morgan Freeman in his most powerful role\u000ayet.\u000a

V\u000a\u000aThough the prison system in the US may have changed by now under extreme\u000a"political correctness", but still "seeing" is believing. Twenty years are\u000aa\u000along time, and the odds are against any one that plots an escape: the\u000alonger\u000athe time, the less believable an escape is. Perhaps the too neatly arranged\u000aescape hurt this movie's credibility, still the movie succeeded in being an\u000aentertaining window into a morbid world which may be too dark for the\u000aoutside to see.  If I agree with one thing in this movie, it is "Never give\u000aup hope", as Andy states it.\u000a

V\u000a\u000aUnfortunately I did not get to see this film in the theaters.  When this\u000afilm was released in 1994 I had grown tired of the "prison" movie.  I had\u000aalready seen TANGO & CASH (T&C) and LOCK UP (LU) both of these films starred\u000aSylvester Stallone.  I had also seen Death Warrant (DW) with Jean Claude Van\u000aDamme and figured that this would just be another run of them mill movie\u000aabout a guy wrongfully imprisoned.  Eventually I rented this film and boy\u000awas I wrong!  Unlike the earlier mentioned films this was not an action\u000aflick but an emotional story about the hardships of prison life and the\u000astruggle an inmate encounters trying to maintain hope of eventually leaving\u000athe prison.  I so enjoyed this movie that I obtained the original novel and\u000afound that while there are some changes to the story they are relatively\u000aminor and do not detract from the theme of the story.  In my review I will\u000acompare the book to the film.  Spoilers may be present in the\u000areview.1.  In the book Andy Dufresne is in jail until 1975.  In the movie he is\u000aonly in jail until 1967.2.  In the book Andy's poster at the time of his departure is one of Linda\u000aRonstadt.  In the movie it is Raquel Welch.3.  In the book Andy served time under several wardens and head guards.  In\u000athe movie Warden Norton was in office for Andy's entire prison stay as was\u000athe head guard Byron Hadley.  Actually in the book Byron Hadley was the head\u000aguard when Andy arrived in Shawshank and had retired by the time Norton\u000abecame warden.  4.  In the book Red is describe as Irish and although no reference is made\u000ato his race I assumed he was white.  In the movie Red is black being\u000aportrayed by Morgan Freeman, and the character Red indicates that he is\u000aIrish.  While this does not contradict the book I think by making Red an\u000aAfrican American it differed from most readers conception of Red.  However,\u000aMorgan Freeman did such a fine job in the role of Red it is impossible for\u000ame to think of anyone else in that role.5.  In the book Andy, with help from a friend in the outside world, invests\u000aall his money prior to his arrest under a false identity so that when he\u000aleaves Shawshank he has money to start over with.  In the movie Andy departs\u000awith Warden Norton's ill gotten gains to start his new\u000alife.6.  In the book no warden commits suicide and no prisoner is killed after\u000athe warden stages a fake escape attempt.  Both these acts occur in the\u000amove.There are other small differences between the movie and the book but none\u000athat alter the overall story.  I would suggest to all that this story is\u000aworth reading and watching.  There is a reason that it is ranked so high in\u000aIMDB's ranking chart.  Just a bit of trivia for Stephen King fans.  The character of Andy Dufresne\u000aalso has a key cameo role in Stephen King's book APT PUPIL.  It is Andy\u000aDufresne that unknowingly helps escaped Nazi henchman Kurt Dussander set up\u000aa life in America.  This occurs while Andy is working at the Maine bank\u000aprior to going to Shawshank.\u000a

One thing I am sure of tho,\u000aand that's the superiority of The Shawshank Redemption amongst it's genre.\u000aIt may not be completely realistic, it may have a few cliches, but I don't\u000asee why some people seem to think that an utterly entertaining and well made\u000amovie suddenly isn't just that anymore if it has a few silly things in\u000ait.For the last 12 or so years I've watched movies like a true fanatic,\u000athousands and thousands of them, and I've pretty much seen all the ones that\u000acount.

V\u000a\u000aThe Shawshank Redemption is my favorite movie of all time.  Tim Robbins\u000aand\u000aMorgan Freeman are handing out the best performances of there life in this\u000afilm.  Its about how a banker named Andy Dufrense (Tim Robbins) goes\u000athrough\u000aprison.  And along the way becomes best friends with Red(Freeman).  This\u000astory is all about hope and friendship.  This films has several very\u000amoving\u000ascenes.  From the rooftop scene to the ending (the best ending ever).  And\u000athe movie kinda has 4 endings.  (4 best endings ever).  Should have taken\u000ahome best picture, original score, screenplay (Frank Darabont), and\u000acinamitography oscars.  But was over looked by forrest gump (which is\u000agood,\u000abut not better then shawshank) and pulp fiction (still yet to see).  "Hope\u000ais a good thing, maybe the best of things, and no good thing ever dies"...\u000athats damn right.10/10   A+   \u000a

V\u000a\u000aI will not rehash the plot outline as many other reviewers have done a\u000afine\u000ajob of presenting it. Note, however, that this is not an action/adventure\u000afilm. It is not fast-paced. It is grueling and harsh in part. But it\u000aevolves\u000ainto a moving story of the triumph of indomitable human spirit over\u000acrushing\u000aadversity."The Shawshank Redemption" packs an intense and unforgettable emotional\u000awallop. Thanks to a perfect blend of cinematography, acting, soundtrack,\u000aand\u000aplot development, the film takes the viewer on an unforgettable emotional\u000aroller coaster ride. It masterfully elicits powerful emotions running the\u000agamut from the lowest lows to the highest highs.I read a great number of other IMDb members' excellent comments on this\u000afilm. I think it is safe to say that those of us who rate "Shawshank"\u000aamong\u000aour favorite movies share one view in common --we truly FELT the impact of\u000athis film.Some who disliked the film have argued that certain aspects of the plot\u000aare\u000aunrealistic. I must note that I thoroughly enjoyed the plot itself.\u000aNonetheless, is every element of the story realistic?  It really doesn't\u000amatter.This is not a purely plot-driven vehicle. This is far more than a "life in\u000aprison" film. The prison serves as the framework in an ongoing struggle\u000abetween hope and hopelessness under the most adverse circumstances. The\u000abeauty of "Shawshank" is the way it excels in evoking a great range of\u000ahuman\u000aemotions while presenting a fulfilling and moving tale of resilient human\u000aspirit.Whether viewed as "true to life" or a parable, "Shawshank" succeeds in\u000amaking us really care about the main characters. It is unsurpassed in\u000amaking\u000athe viewer feel the full emotional impact of events as they unfold. It\u000aexcels in making us feel fine gradations of despair and hope, cruelty and\u000akindness, hatred and friendship, sadness and joy.Along with the excellence of the film as a whole, I consider a certain\u000ascene\u000aamong the most intense, fulfilling  and memorable moments I have\u000aexperienced\u000ain cinema. (I won't discuss it for the benefit of those who have not yet\u000aseen the film.)"The Shawshank Redemption" is a true masterpiece of film making. It is\u000aunsurpassed in evoking a full range of intense human emotions as it\u000aproceeds\u000ato an unforgettable conclusion. It fully deserves its place  as one of the\u000aall-time greats in film history.\u000a

V\u000a\u000aI think the hungarian title of this movie is more apposite: Prisoners of\u000ahope or Slaves of hope (A remény rabjai). It sounds beautiful in\u000ahungarian.This movie created a genre that can't be defined. The story is\u000aabout hope, "a good thing" as Andy Dufrense calls it. "Maybe the best of\u000athings".And that's the point. Hope dies last. Every decent man should\u000aappreciate this movie. \u000a

V\u000a\u000aShawshank Redemption, a true heart warming epic has sat in my heart among\u000amy\u000afavorites. Tim Robbins has given the performance of his life, even after\u000awatching the movie again and again, i cant stop thinking what he did, how\u000apatient and intelligent the guy was that even his closest friend morgan\u000afreeman cant think of what he can do or what he did. The strong dialogues\u000aand the delivery makes an unstoppable emotional attachement between the\u000acharacters and audience. If you havent seen it, dont blame me why you are\u000amissing it. \u000a

V\u000a\u000aI am what you might call a movie fanatic.  I have literally seen thousands\u000aof movies.  I have a movie collection of over 1000 different movies.  When\u000aasked, "what's my favorite movie?", I can think of a favorite movie in a\u000acategory, a favorite movie by a particular actor, a favorite movie in a\u000aparticular year, a favorite style of movie, and a favorite in practically\u000aanything else you can think of.  However, there is only one movie that I\u000afelt it necessary to sign up for IMDb, there is only one movie that still\u000asends chills up and down my spine when I watch it, there is only one movie\u000athat stands out among the rest, there is only one movie that leads the\u000apack\u000aover the thousands of movies I watched in the last 9 or ten years, and\u000athere\u000ais only one movie that I can truly say is my favorite, number one movie of\u000aall time, and that movie is Shawshank Redemption.  This is my first review\u000aand when you look up the top voted lists on IMDb and you see Shawshank\u000aRedemption in the top 3, you will know that I, too, was mesmerized by this\u000amovie.  The only movie, in my opinion, that was ever worthy of a\u000a10.\u000aPhillip\u000a

I\u000alove movies like this where you root for the underdog, in this case\u000awrongfully convicted Andy Dufresne, skillfully played by Tim Robbins. The\u000acunning of Dufresne is amazing, and the movie throws in a nice moral lesson\u000aon the importance of friendship. Also the directing and cinematography are\u000agreat.

V\u000a\u000aThe Shawshank Redemption is a brilliant, timeless story of a young man named\u000aAndy Dufresne (Tim Robbins) who is convicted and imprisoned for the murder\u000aof his wife. While in prison, he befriends an older black man named Red\u000a(Morgan Freeman). This film masterpiece just takes you through the years\u000aAndy spends in prison, and the hope that human spirit can keep alive even in\u000athe most hopeless circumstances. Tim Robbins exhibits a quality in this film\u000athat is inexplicable but charming. You really fall in love with his\u000acharacter and I genuinly believe (Robbins) acting in this film is perhaps\u000aone of the most moving performances ever caught on film. This really pushed\u000ame to respect the cast and really open my eyes to their acting abilities.\u000aThis truimphant tale will leave a bittersweet trail through your heart as it\u000adid mine. ****\u000a

V\u000aWARNING, SPOILER AHEAD!  DO NOT READ UNTIL YOU HAVE SEEN THE\u000aFILM.This film is one of the most hotly contested films ever made.  Some, like\u000amyself, love it and it takes pride of place in their video, DVD\u000acollections.\u000aOthers detest it and I think the reason for this is that they have\u000acompletely missed the one point Mr Darabont was trying to make.The prison in the film is a representation of life itself, Andy didn't\u000achoose to be there he was put there by circumstances beyond his control.\u000aThis is supposed to mean that in life sometimes thing happen to us,\u000apartners\u000aleave, jobs are lost etc.  that are beyond our control and we simply have\u000ato\u000adeal with them.  Andy makes the best life he can for himself in the\u000asituation he is in and makes a friend in Red.  He then, through his ability\u000ato maintain a level of hope that things will get better, inspires those\u000aaround him by teaching Red the value of hope and teaching the ill fated\u000aTommy to read etc.  In the end he escapes from prison and puts all that is\u000awrong within it right.You can tell Darabont, like many of us, has had times where life seemed\u000apointless and everything was against him.  What he tried, and succeeded, to\u000asay is no matter how bad things get if you believe that things will get\u000abetter they will.I recently read that Tim Robbins frequently gets members of the public\u000acoming up to him in the street and telling him how important the film was\u000ato\u000athem.  How it helped them get through a time in their life they where truly\u000amiserable and, as his character said in the film, gave them hope.\u000a\u000a

V\u000a\u000aThe Shawshank Redemption, I first viewed this film when i was maybe 8 or 9\u000aand i didn't really understand then.  When i saw it later in life my\u000aappreciation for the film grew and constantly does every time i view it.  It\u000ais the first large film from Frank Darabont and he directs with such feeling\u000ait doesn't strike as a beginning for his career but, more as it was done by\u000aa professional at the art of film making.  The Shawshank Redemption is a story of courage, friendship and confinement\u000ain the setting of a large prison in New England, Shawshank.  Andy Dufresne\u000ais a gifted banker who is convicted of murdering his wife because she was\u000acheating on him with a golfer.  He is sentenced to two life sentences to be\u000aserved at the Shawshank Prison.  Andy arrives, and is judged by his suit as\u000aa rich man who will crack on the first night, Andy does the contrary.  He\u000aends up showing his strength in silence, he doesn't make attempts to make\u000afriends until one day when he needs an item.  Ellis Redding, he's the man in\u000athis particular prison who knows how to get things and does so for people\u000awilling to pay the extra 10% on the item.  Andy introduces himself in the\u000ayard and asks for an item 'Red' isn't anxious to get it for him at first,\u000abut gives in at the end.  I wont reveal any more of the film for the reason that, you have to\u000aexperience it yourself.  All that i can convey across this review is be\u000aprepared to be affected in ways you never imagined.  I would go as far to\u000apraise it as one of the most powerfully affecting stories ever conveyed\u000athrough film.  Don't presuppose anything just because it was overlooked at\u000athe Academy Awards, Superb acting, directing, cinematography and story\u000atelling will magnetize you.9/10 "Hope is a good thing, maybe the best of things, and no good thing ever\u000adies"\u000a

The actors all do a fine job,\u000afrom Morgan Freeman to Tim Robbins. The plot is outstanding, probably\u000abecause it used one of Stephen King's best novels as a screenwrite. And the\u000asetting, well what can you say? Shows prison from a whole new standpoint. As\u000aof now, this film is tied with "Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the\u000aRing" for the best movie I have ever had the pleasure of viewing.\u000a\u000a

V\u000a\u000aThe prision movie is one of those rare genres where more or less every film\u000aturns out to be a winner (The Great Escape, Pappilon, Midnight Express),\u000abut The Shawshank Redemption of 1994 may well take its place as the best of\u000athem all.  Frank Darabont's hugely impressive picture cuts a remarkable\u000abalance in paying attention to the harsh realities brutalities of prison\u000alife whilst also successfully conveying the power and determination of the\u000ahuman spirit.  Tim Robbins is Andy DeFrans, a banker sent to the maximum security Shawshank\u000aprison for life for the alleged murder of his wife and lover, where he\u000astrikes up a friendship with the seasoned convict Red (Morgan Freeman).  The\u000afilm has enjoyed huge popularity and acclaim since its surprisingly passive\u000a1994 release (perhaps due to the attention surronding Forrest Gump) and\u000aalmost certainly deserves its label as a contemporary classic; few films\u000acarry such a magnetic, absorbing and attentive pull.  The result is\u000asomething that not only ranks as great entertainment but a chance for the\u000aviewer themselves to enjoy and appreciate a first-class piece of\u000ascreenwriting and film-making.\u000a

V\u000a\u000aDon't listen to ANY negative reviews on this film. Just go out, and buy it.\u000aYes, buy, not rent. Most people who didn't like this will tell you it's a\u000a"fairy tale" and "cliched", but you will not find a movie that moves you as\u000amuch as this. This is the reason people see movies. The story is about a man\u000asent to prison for the murder of his wife. He claims to be innocent, but we\u000aare never given any proof. Inside, he makes friends with many of the inmates\u000aand from that point on, what follows is one of the most brilliant and\u000aastounding films ever. Leonard Maltin said the movie was too long. Who\u000acares? I was not bored through a single second of this movie. It held my\u000ainterest for over 2 hours, and that's no small feat. I haven't read any\u000aother critic's reviews on this, and I don't have to. No matter what they\u000asay, nothing will ever make me change my mind that this is one of the best\u000afilms ever made. They can hate it with a passion for all I care, at least us\u000amoviegoers know what we like. If you want to see a movie that will change\u000ayour life, one of those movies that stay with you forever, then go get this.\u000aExtremely moving, gripping, sad, and cheerful, you HAVE to see this. From\u000aTim Robbins standing in the rain with his arms stretched to the sky, to\u000aMorgan Freeman walking down a sandy stretch of deserted beach in the film's\u000aunforgettable ending, this movie truly touched me in a way few movies ever\u000ado. SEE THIS. On a scale of 1-10, you can't even rate this\u000aone.\u000a

V\u000a\u000aThis very sophisticated and beautifully storytelling, the way a great movie\u000ais supposed to be.When I saw the trailers and clips from this movie when it was first\u000areleased, I thought to myself; "Yeah right, another self-conscious\u000aOscar-nominated prison dirge with it's heart fastened firmly to it's\u000asleeve".  I expected it to be another "worthy" movie like CHATTAHOOCHEE or\u000athe usual 80s telemovie types.  It wasn't until I sat down and watched the\u000atv release that i really got involved with the story.I particularly like the way the story has heart and feelings, but is not\u000asappy or pretentious.  There is humour, pathos, tragedy, and irony in equal\u000ameasure.  So if you're like me and usually don't like ponderous prison\u000adramas, I reckon you should see this movie anyway, and you should  find that\u000ait's surprizingly refreshing storytelling.\u000a

V\u000a\u000a(SPOILERS AHEAD)Anyone who thinks this is a great film was surely taken by Freeman's\u000aperformance (great, as always) to such a point he mistook this fantasy trip\u000afor a drama (or is a sure sucker for fairytales).Now, I don't have a problem with fairytales, when they present themselves\u000aas\u000asuch, but this film gives itself so much importance and melodrama (more\u000athan\u000aSchindler's list, which as many factual errors as it has, it tells a\u000aserious\u000aand REAL story) it kills the good feeling one could get from watching, say,\u000aLost in Space.Why it's pure fairytale? Simple:1.- No racial tension whatsoever (in real life, any white guy who behaved\u000alike Andy, like walking up to a black inmate he don't know and just start\u000atalking to him, would get his butt kicked, at least).2.- All relevant (except "the sisters") prisioners, saints.3.- Andy can get a REAL (not fake) driver's license and S.S. number for a\u000abogus identity. NO ONE, no matter what "cracks" in the sistem he's aware\u000aof,\u000acan get REAL documents like those BY MAIL. You have to actually show up for\u000athe process to begin. And Andy never says anything about someone doing this\u000afor him. He's no carrer criminal, so he can't know people willing to commit\u000aa felony (impersonating someone else to get license and S.S. number is a\u000afelony), no legit guy would ever risk end up in jail. And THEIR picture\u000awould end up on the license, so Andy not only would have to supply them\u000awith\u000abogus ID (he required all that to a specific name) to get license and S.S.\u000anumber, he would have to forge the license (place his own picture), and he\u000adon't look like a forge artist to me, nor has such connections.4.- He gets gang-raped many times and doesn't end up traumatized. NO ONE\u000agoes through that (and not only once, but many times), without suffering\u000aSERIOUS psychological damage, or if he's an incredible tough guy (and Andy\u000aisn't), at the very least without looking for SERIOUS revenge (Max Cady in\u000aCape Fear). He suffers neither. From a simple beating one could buy him not\u000aending up distressed, but from a gang-rape, and several of them?\u000aPLEASE...5.- He pulls of such a slick escape James Bond would be proud of. A white\u000ayuppie banker can pull of what none of the lifers can? And the "he never\u000alost hope" excuse don't cut it.6.- The prison guards NEVER once open up his books (where he kept the rock\u000ahammer). At any prison of medium security the raids include the books as\u000awell, never mind a maximum security facility.7.- Red remembers Andy's intructions EXACTLY, even when these were told to\u000ahim only once and at a relax, casual moment. And after DECADES, the place\u000aAndy described remained THE SAME. PLEASE...In fact, the ONLY believable thing in this film are the sisters (every\u000aprison has them), the sadistic prison guards and corrupt warden (back then\u000aprisons were the warden's own kingdom, they could do what they pleased).\u000aNOTHING ELSE.Like I said, if this fairytale presented itself as the fairytale it is, no\u000aproblem. But it presents itself as something serious (being in prison is\u000asomething VERY serious), and I just don't buy that. Check out HBO's "OZ"\u000aand\u000ayou'll see what a maximum security prison (and inmates) are really\u000alike.\u000a

V\u000a\u000aThis is without a doubt, the best film of the 90's.  Morgan Freeman is\u000abrilliant as Red, his story is just as compelling as Andy Dufrense's.  Only\u000arepeated viewings made me realise this.  Another oscar tragedy that Forrest\u000aGump won best picture over this, typical USA USA carry on.  This story also\u000aproves Stephen King as a wonderfull writer and not just a one-dimensional\u000ahorror novelist.  So heartwarming, great humour particularly from the head\u000aprison guard and the best, most bitter sweet revenge in any film I can think\u000aof.  A no questions asked 10/10.\u000a

V\u000a\u000aI never got the chance to see this when it was in the theaters.  I bought\u000athis DVD when I saw it on sale at a music store, keeping in mind its place\u000ain the imdb top 250.  Now that I have the DVD, I've seen it a number of\u000atimes, each time not being my last.As to whether this movie "should have" won the Oscar for best picture, my\u000aopinion is not firm on that.  In many ways I really do wish TSR had won, but\u000aI do love both movies (Forrest Gump, and this one) each in their own right. \u000aThey are two entirely different movies, each well done, and moving for their\u000aown reasons.In "The Shawshank Redemption", Tim Robbins gives a breathtaking performance\u000aas Andy Dufresne, a man who is in the wrong place at the wrong time, leading\u000ato his wrongful conviction of the death of his wife and her lover.  He gets\u000atwo life sentences, back to back, to be served at the Shawshank\u000aprison.It is there that he meets Red (Morgan Freeman), an inmate who has been at\u000aShawshank for much longer and has establish status as "a man who can get\u000athings".  Through his friendship with Red, and his experience as a banker,\u000ahe gains the respect of the corrupt prison guards, and the other inmates,\u000aand manages to be rid of the abuse he was enduring at the hands of two\u000a"sisters".  He also works very hard to build the best prison library in the\u000acountry, and help illiterate men get their high school\u000adiploma.My favorite scene is the one where everyone stopped what they were doing and\u000astood transfixed as they listened to the beautiful sounds of a Mozart opera.\u000a It never fails to bring tears to my eyes.  I also like the "Beer on the\u000aRoof" scene, but the Mozart segment is the one that will always be among my\u000afavorites.\u000a

V\u000a\u000a*Spoilers*I would have to come up with a new set of words to describe how incredible\u000aand amazing this movie is.  Tim Robbins gives the world his best\u000aperformance\u000aever.  Along with Morgan Freeman.  Instead of 7 oscar nominations and\u000alosses, it should have had 5 Oscar wins and 8 nominations.  It should have\u000awon Best Picture, Best Director, Best Screenplay, best original score, and\u000abest cinematography.  I would have given both Tom Hanks and Tim Robbins\u000abest\u000aactor for this one.  Forrest gump is a great movie, maybe tom hanks had a\u000abetter performance, but Shawshank is such a better movie with a better\u000ascript.  The movie contains quotes you can use to describe life.  "Get busy\u000alivin, get busy dieing."  "Fear can hold you prisoner, hope can set you\u000afree."  This movie goes by quickly.  Very little times where you glance at\u000ayour watch.  And the scene where Andy escapes and climbs through\u000aeverything,\u000aand stips and stands in the river of crap letting the rain wash away his\u000asins and giving him his freedom which he deserves is the greatest movie\u000amoments of all time.  By far deserves the second best movie of all time.11/10\u000a

V\u000a\u000aTo say that "The Shawshnak Redemption" is a truly great film doesn't do it\u000ajustice. Having read a lot of the comments already on here about this film,\u000athere really isn't much more I could add to it. *SPOILERS*\u000aHowever there are two things that might not have been said about his film.\u000aRegardless of how much I love this film and rank it very high. I have one\u000aproblem with it & that is that it is too long. Mainly I say this because\u000athere are parts where this film could have ended and I would have been just\u000aas satisfied. My personal point for this film to end would have probably\u000abeen when we see Andy Dufrense driving on the highway beside the Pacific.\u000aEither that or when Red narrates about how he hopes he can make it across\u000athe boarder and how he hopes to see his friend.\u000aThe other comment I have about this film is that they tell you what is going\u000ato happen...in a way. The scene in which we hear of Andy's desire to "get\u000abusy living or get busy dying" The scene in which he wants to go to Mexico &\u000aopen a hotel on the beach and fix up a boat & take his guests charter\u000afishing. In that scene Red listens to Andy & then tells him "You shouldn't\u000ado this to yourself. This is just Sh!*ty pipe dreams." Hearing that after\u000ahaving seen the movie as many times as I have I thought it was amusing for\u000athat to be said.\u000aStill I would rank Shawshank in my Top Ten easily. Far and away the best\u000amovie of 1994 and was snubbed for Best Picture. Not to mention Morgan\u000aFreeman. But almost as bad was the fact that neither Tim Robbins nor Frank\u000aDarabont were even nominated. \u000a9 1/2 out of 10\u000a

V\u000a\u000a`Fried Green Tomatoes' came to mind when I first saw The Shawshank\u000aRedemption. I know they're two entirely different movies, but they had the\u000asame set-up; the narration, the way happy things happened to the supporting\u000acharacters based on the effort of one/some of them. Both movies also touch\u000aon unfairness, but perhaps it's the point of view and nature of friendship\u000awhich make them so similar. The whole cast was absolutely fantastic. Morgan Freeman didn't even look\u000alike he was acting; `Red' was that real. Tim Robbins, often more renowned\u000afor droll characters is top-rate as the shady yet generous Andy; Clancy\u000aBrown was detestable as the foul-mouthed murderous guard, James Whitmore a\u000ahoot as the bird man guy, and Bob Gunton, disgusting and sordid as the\u000awarden  not your regular scheming bad guy  this guy was bad with a capital\u000a`b'.  An excellent movie, and somehow excellent enough for people to put it in\u000athe Top 5 spot here. It wasn't without its flaws, but when ordered with\u000aother movies that were nominated in 1994 for best picture (and on the top\u000a250), `Shawshank' would be the best of them.\u000a

V\u000a\u000ai dont know what to see about this movie that hasn't already been said. as\u000agood as movie as forrest gump was, the only major award it should have won\u000aover shawshank was tom hanks as best actor. an argument can be made for\u000azemeckis for director, but seeing as shawshank redemption is such a better\u000amovie, and most of the movie takes place in location, (shawshank prison) i\u000athink darabont is robbed not only for not winning the oscar, but not even\u000ascoring a nomination. and seeing as he would be the best director, i would\u000athink that if you're directed your film best it would logically be the best\u000apicture. tim robbins is also robbed of a nomination, and i think hanks just\u000aedges him for that trophy. the biggest travesty of all is that shawshank\u000adoesn't even win any of the oscars it was nominated for. if you havent seen\u000athis film recently, go pop it in the dvd or vcr and just sit back and revel\u000ain its magnificence.\u000a

V\u000a\u000aIs The Shawshank Redemption the second best movie of all time?  No, it\u000aisn't.  However, I contributed to its ranking by giving it a 10/10 vote. \u000aYes, IMDB's Top 250 list is flawed in the sense that some of the greatest\u000afilms ever made inspire some of the most violently negative reactions in a\u000asizable contingent of the collective movie-viewing public (thereby rendering\u000athem ineligible for the highest overall voting average).  The Shawshank\u000aRedemption, however, clearly did not evoke many negative reactions- should\u000athe film be faulted for that?Absolutely not, I say.  This is a grand movie that strikes one fundamentally\u000areal and basic existential chord, namely the abstraction of faith and hope\u000awithin the context of the tremendous pain and frustration humanity inflicts\u000aupon itself.  Faith does not have to be of a religious nature, and The\u000aShawshank Redemption doesn't go there (this is why I love it, but abhor The\u000aGreen Mile).  Rather, the faith of Shawshank is a stubborn, earthly, human\u000afaith, that despite the arbitrary injustice of existence, the individual can\u000apersevere and affirm within himself or herself that yes, life is worth\u000aliving.  For my money, that is solid return on two hours of my\u000atime.I am a cynic and a misanthrope, supremely so on both counts.  That said, I\u000aacknowledge that I have no choice but to accept the context of my existence\u000afor what it is, and I can either "get busy living or get busy dying." \u000aApparently, most people agree on some level.\u000a\u000a

V\u000a\u000aApparently no one realizes that this film is a roman a clef for the Beer\u000aHall Putsch of 1923.  Yet the lighting and camera angles on the Andy\u000aDufresne character resemble not so much a neo-German expressionism as\u000aminimalist/realist approach filtered through the homoeroticism of Oscar\u000aWilde.  The internecine conflict within Shawshank itself was analogous to\u000athe contradictions inherent in the Weimar Republic, and the cinema verite\u000aquality with which the shower scenes were depicted definitely allude to the\u000adramatic proportions of The Rape of Lucrece (although the filmmakers took\u000asome license in their liberal use of domestic ferrets in those\u000ascenes).\u000aThe ultimate cinematic meaning of redemption derives not so much from the\u000aallegorical representation of patriarchic subjugation and the meaningless\u000asex it inspires, but from Dufresne's triumphant final crawl through the\u000ametaphysical "tunnel of love" to consummate his desire for\u000afreedom.\u000aSix years later this film was remade as "Slackers" and although the setting\u000aand characters are somewhat different, the existentialist struggle for\u000ajustice and inner peace still resonate clearly.\u000a

V\u000a\u000aThere are some very special movies out there.\u000aThere are those which are highly thought-provoking and leave you\u000aquestioning\u000athings. There are those which are a mindless blast and great fun to boot.\u000aAnd then there are those which are simply sublime. They might keep it\u000asimple, but they execute in such a way that they drag you in deep and have\u000ayou caring about the characters. The Shawshank Redemption is one such\u000afilm.\u000aThis is a absolutely outstanding story which is as simple as it is\u000aeloquent.It's about a man wrongly imprisoned for the murder of his wife and\u000asentenced\u000ato life at Shawshank. There he slowly finds friends and the drama of their\u000alives is the focus of the story.\u000aHe promises many times that he *will* break out within 20 years, and no\u000aone,\u000aof course, believes him. It's this hope which drives the whole movie. Men\u000ain\u000aprison have nothing but hope. Take that away and they have nothing. And\u000athat's what Andy (The main character) wants to avoid.The ending to this is simply breathtaking in its simplicity, but incredibly\u000aheartwarming and will have you punching the air in delight.Nominated for 4 oscars, this won none of them.

V\u000a   ***SPOILERS***   ***SPOILERS***\u000aWhen I saw the movie for the first time I was a child of 8 years old I\u000aguess. I was completely obsessed by this movie. The movie took too much\u000atime\u000aso my parents didn't allow me to see the end of the movie. I was mad as\u000ayou\u000acan understand ;) Now Im a boy of 16 years old and I saw the movie 8\u000atimes.\u000aIm a bit of a movie freak, if I have the time for it I watch one every\u000aevening. I have seen a lot of movies. But not such good as The Shawshank\u000aRedemption. This movie is a perfection. It has a perfect story. The movie\u000ais\u000avery long, but I have never bored while I was watching. The sound and\u000amusic\u000aare also perfect. When Brooks leaves the prison and sees the daylife again\u000athe music is totally perfect. You are going to think about some things you\u000ahave done in your life. That's the same when Andy escapes and arranges the\u000abeers for his friends. Red says about Andy when you him sitting in the sun\u000a(when he has arranged the beers) with a little smile on his face: 'I think\u000ahe did it to feel normal again'. That are lines when you start thinking.\u000aAnd\u000awhen Red is allowed to leave prison you got a kind of a winner feeling.\u000aThen\u000ahe sees Andy again, that's the perfect end. This movie was not a simple\u000aprison breakout. But a movie with the best story I have ever seen. I can\u000asay\u000ato everyone that you have to see the movie. Im sure you will think the\u000asame\u000away as I do. When you see it multiple times you will understand the movie\u000abetter and better, and I hope you will love then as much as I\u000ado!\u000a

V\u000aI actually can't see how TSR wound up so high in the IMDB\u000atop-250.It was a fine movie in many ways, but I was disappointed that it didn't meet\u000athe expectations that had been planted in my mind by friends and family that\u000awanted me to see it.  I had been led to believe that it was going to be a\u000aprofoundly "impactful" insight into the nature of love, brotherhood, the\u000astruggle for freedom, and, of course, redemption.  The movie for me was a\u000alittle muddied by a couple of things.And it's hard to pin down.  I guess there was something "dirty" about the\u000aidea that the redemption took the form of everything turning out rosy and\u000aperfect for Our Heroes; that it was an outer redemption, rather than an\u000ainner redemption.  It just felt as though the level of insight I was\u000aexpecting would have to look a little more different from the "standard" (as\u000ait were) firehose of hollywoodesque plot twists, black/white hat-ism, and\u000arosy outcome.  To give you an idea of where I'm coming from, the redemption\u000ascene at the end of...Eraserhead(!)...is cleaner in my mind than Shawshank,\u000ajust because we are forced to fill in the blanks left by a totally alien\u000aprojection of spiritual struggle.  When we fill in the blanks, we have to\u000adraw upon the (in this case) redemption "within us"; Shawshank seems to be\u000aattempting to fill in all the blanks, leaving nothing for us to do.  And, as\u000aI already said, some of the fill is questionable in my\u000amind.Lastly, I was unable to pick up on a key plot element toward the end; how\u000aexactly did Andy "nail" the prison officialdom?  It appeared he was able to\u000a"hip" state oversight to the egregious abuses of power; but that a mere\u000aprisoner--even one vested with a certain amount of bureaucratic\u000aaccess--should be able to accomplish this seems impossible, and I was not\u000aeven able to make out the general contours of such a mechanism in the movie.\u000a I'll admit I might maybe have to see the movie again.  And the movie was\u000agood enough that I might well do just that.  But, again, when\u000afriends/family/IMDB-user-commenters said this was a billion thumbs-up movie,\u000aI expected something somehow more challenging.\u000a

V\u000aWhen I first watched "The Shawshank Redeption", I thought it was a O-K\u000amovie. Something in the characters and the motion picture score would draw\u000ame back to see the movie again. Now, it is one of my all-time favorite\u000amovies. It is a classic. The story, adapted from a Steven King novel,\u000astays\u000atrue to the book. To me, there is something intriguing about a person\u000achanging his destiny, especially against all hope. The casting of the key\u000aplayers in the movie are right on target, and Morgan Freeman and Tim\u000aRobbins\u000awork very well together. So, when you get a great script, talented actors\u000acast properly, and a movie score that captures the mood and drama of the\u000ascene, it makes for a memorable movie.\u000a

Watching this film leaves you with a\u000agood feeling - it makes you realise that true friendship is hard to find\u000abut\u000asomething to really cherish.  The story of Andy & Red (The 2 main\u000acharacters), and how they go about living in the prison is moving, gritty\u000aand very realistic. I recommend this film to everyone, young and old, it\u000awill appeal to everyone.  Its a brilliant film capped by a brilliant\u000aending.\u000a10/10\u000a

And then there's the acting, which I cannot praise enough\u000afor everyone's excellent portrayal.

V\u000a\u000aThere are many movies that will leave me wanting more. This movie was one of\u000athem. It is about a man, Andy Dufresne (Tim Robbins),who is sentenced to\u000aprison for life, for the murder of his wife and her lover. He then meets\u000aanother inmate who is sentenced for life as well, Ellis Redding (Morgan\u000aFreeman). Ellis, who has been there for about 30 years , befriends Andy and\u000atells him about the way of life in the Shawshank Prison. I believe the\u000achoice of actors was superb. I think the movie would have gotten out of hand\u000aif Tim Robbins wasn't cast for the part of the soft-spoken Andy. There were\u000aparts in the movie that would have been completely ridiculous and impossible\u000aif he didn't take them and create a surrealism around it. As for Morgan\u000aFreeman, what can I say. His narraration was informative . He was also\u000aperfect for the role if Ellis. During the whole duration of the movie I\u000acouldn't find one part that he hesitated or he looked as if his emotions\u000aweren't for real. The plot is simply outstanding and the movie has a very\u000aclever and witty end. It is amazing how Frank Darabont was able to piece\u000athis movie together and create such a perfect end to a perfect movie. RATING\u000a***** out of ****\u000a

Morgan\u000aFreeman and Tim Robbins play the most believable and likeable characters\u000aever.  The movie is like a good hit of ecstacy.  It builds up for so long\u000athat you really come to like Andy and hate the warden.  Then before the\u000aend\u000ahe escapes, the warden throws the rock through the wall, the warden kills\u000ahimself, and finally they are on a beach in Mexico.  All the special\u000aeffects\u000aon earth couldn't give me a rush like the end of this movie.  It just\u000acreates this moving emotional feeling inside and you feel as vindicated as\u000ayou know Andy and Red must feel.Of course there are many other great moments in the middle of the movie.\u000aFor example, when they get to drink the beer and when the guy passes the\u000atest.

V\u000a\u000aI never expected to have a movie about prison be among my ten favorite\u000amovies of all time, but The Shawshank Redemption stands in that category. \u000aThis, however, is no ordinary prison movie.  It is a movie that cuts to the\u000acore of the human psyche and exposes the ideas of hope, strength, and\u000asurvival all within the character of Andy Dufresne.I recently finished reading the short story "Rita Hayworth and Shawshank\u000aRemption" on which this movie is based.  While the story is a great one and\u000aStephen King is an exceptionally talented writer, I believe that this film\u000amanages to take a small morsel of a story and stretch its meaning and\u000acharacters out into a fully engrossing film that will reach the viewer on\u000aall levels.  Tim Robbins does an excellent job as the complex Andy Dufresne\u000aand shows the range of emotions that Andy comes to feel during his sentence\u000awithin his actions and expressions.  While the character of Red is a white\u000aIrishman in the story, the movie chooses to make him black and cast Morgan\u000aFreeman.  This was a wise choice and Freeman brings his immense talent to\u000athe character on screen, displaying Red's cunning nature and raw emotion. \u000aAll of the other major characters are given more life in the movie than the\u000abook, and work well together to create the prison atmosphere of Shawshank. \u000aWhile reading the book, I kept expecting to read about one of my favorite\u000ascenes in the movie, where Andy locks the warden's office door and plays the\u000auplifting opera music for all of the inmates.  This is an excellent addition\u000athat made the movie even more effective.  The twist ending where Andy gives\u000athe warden his "just desserts" in the movie is more satisfying than when it\u000ais omitted in the book.So there are people out there who call this movie overrated.  Maybe it is. \u000aIt does tend to pull at your emotions in various ways throughout its\u000aruntime.  And it manages to touch many different sensitive issues that\u000apeople hold dear.  But it has such a strong message and so many effective\u000ascenes that you can't help but enjoy it.  This movie made me, a naive high\u000aschool student upon my first viewing, take a deeper look at life, the impact\u000aof hope, and the effects of prison.  Forrest Gump is an excellent movie, but\u000aI don't understand why the Academy chose to reward it instead of The\u000aShawshank Redemption.Call it overrated if you like, but it's still one of my\u000afavorites.10/10\u000a

V\u000a\u000aShawshank is an absolutely amazing film.  Its concept is not especially\u000acompelling; you might even call it plain, but oh, the execution!  Certainly\u000athis is how to make a movie.I saw Shawshank in the cinema, which is always good, but not necessary for\u000aa\u000afilm where the plot and filmatic skill are what draw you in.  When I left,\u000aI\u000anoticed that everyone was sniffling.  The film is so beautiful that even\u000athe\u000atough people cried.  I don't mean that it's a tearjerker either, it doesn't\u000amake you cry out of sadness or pull cheap stunts to get the tears flowing.\u000aWell, perhaps sadness has something to do with it, but it's a deeper kind\u000aof\u000asadness, one that's got tears of joy in it too, not "how could they kill\u000athe\u000adog?" sadness.  And while it makes people cry, they're glad they saw it.\u000aIt's not even my kind of movie, but there's no way I can give it less than\u000aa\u000a10.Notice that this movie is loved by all kinds of viewers.  From the people\u000awho aren't so articulate to the movie snobs, this film hits home on a level\u000athat none other I know of does.\u000a

V\u000a\u000aPlease somebody tell me, what genre is this film? When i first saw this i\u000awas told it was the average prison drama; i came from watching it thinking,\u000ayeah right!This film is without a doubt, the greatest film of all time. The aspect that\u000athe film tries to get across to the prison genre is marvelous.Plot Summary: Andy Deufrasne (Tim Robbins) has been falsely convicted of\u000amurdering his beloved wife. Despite his efforts to outwit the courtroom, he\u000ais sentenced to two life-sentences in a large maximum security prison called\u000aShawshank.\u000aThe first few days for Andy are dark to say the least, awaking the drama\u000asense of the whole film. Andy becomes aware of a fellow prisoner known as\u000aRed (Morgan Freeman) - 'The man who can get things'. And when Andy asks Red\u000afor a small rock hammer (A tiny hammer used for shaping and cleaning small\u000arocks), Red gets the impression that Andy isn't your everyday\u000ainmate.\u000aTime goes on and Red becomes more and more aware of Andy's\u000aexcentricity.Favourite Quote: 'Andy gave us the two things we all loathed, time and\u000apatience; because that's all it takes really, time and patience' -\u000aFreeman.Rating: 10/10\u000a\u000a

From watching the Green Mile and\u000afrom what I heard about the Majestic, it seems that Frank Darabont will\u000anever make a movie as good as this again. It is emotional, ambitious, and\u000abreathtaking in equal measure. The last 30 minutes are the best on\u000acelluloid.\u000a

V\u000a\u000aI first saw this film when it appeared on terrestrial TV, and after watching\u000ait and recording it to video, i had the whole family hooked. This is how\u000acriminals should, and were, treated, portraying a very real atmosphere of\u000afear and hopelessness in the American penal system of the Mid-nineties. The\u000asheer determination of Andy (Tim Robbins), after being wrongly accused and\u000asentenced to life in Shawshank, is truly powerful viewing, through his\u000awillpower of never giving up against all odds, and coming out on top through\u000athe worst is a true tale of bravery. The sadistic warden, and his guards add\u000aa real element of terror in the film as they are given the power of God over\u000athe men whom are incarcerated. The film's narration given in retrospect by\u000aRed, paces along beautifully with the storyline, ever giving his thoughts\u000aand comments in a deep rich voice as if telling an old tale to a grandchild,\u000awhich explains and gives his character's point of view throughout the film.\u000aThe twists and turns in the plot opens new windows of interest, and the\u000aending which is nothing short of genius, will surprise even the most cunning\u000aof viewers.\u000a

V\u000a\u000aThe Shawshank Redemption is a good movie.  It's a very good movie.  But\u000aI'd\u000asay it would be a stretch to call it a "great movie" or "the best movie\u000aever\u000amade."  It's a prison drama that illustrates the value of hope.  With\u000ahope,\u000ayou can continue living, and be free.  Without hope, you will always be a\u000aprisoner.  Even former prisoners in this movie cannot truly be free if\u000atheir\u000ahope has been taken away.The movie illustrates its main idea very well, and it is visually\u000astunning,\u000awith a great score.  But there are a few flaws.  Aside from Red and Andy,\u000acharacter development is at a bare minimum.  The warden and several of the\u000aguards never amount to more than cardboard-cutout, pure-evil villains.\u000aThe\u000afilm is also weak in a literary sense.  It's short on symbolism.  Yes,\u000athere\u000ais some, such as Brooks' pet crow, but most ideas and themes are presented\u000ain a plain, literal way.It's a movie that will make you feel good.  And I think the "feel-good"\u000aaspect is why Shawshank is rated so high on IMDb.  I would recommend it as\u000aan uplifting movie, but not as one of the great films of all\u000atime.\u000a

V\u000a\u000aNo you're not hallucinating, this film is underrated! How is it underrated?\u000aAccording to dumb users on IMDB "Lord of the rings: fellowship of the ring"\u000ais better! It starts off with Andy Dufresne (Tim Robbins) a banker in his car with a\u000agun. His wife is sleeping with another man. Next scene is Andy defending\u000ahimself but he gets life in jail at the end of the scene. Andy makes friends\u000awith Red (Morgan Freeman, also narrator). Andy is someone who really hopes\u000ato get out but Red is afraid of getting to used to living behind\u000abars.It turns out to be one of the best films ever. People who haven't seen it\u000asay "Its just a jail film" Its not! When they end up watching it they find\u000aout its not just a jail film. Another thing its unpredictable which is what\u000ayou expect when you see a film.Nobody cannot like this film! I could go on forever about the reasons why\u000athis film is so good, just watch it. 10 out of 10\u000a

V\u000a\u000a'The Shawshank Redemption' is quite simply the best film ever to be\u000aproduced. in no way, shape or form could it be improved in any way. there\u000ais\u000aabsolutely nothing to fault about it. it is brilliantly written and the\u000aacting is second to none, Morgan Freeman is currently the second best\u000aactor\u000ain the world.\u000aThe whole story is masterfully told with a severe twist in the tale that\u000awill leave even the most heartless of people feeling\u000ahappy.\u000aAnyone who has not seen this film, must see it. for me, it deserves the\u000aaccolade, 'A Spanking Piece Of Cinematography'.I love the shawshank redemtion and anyone involved with\u000ait.\u000a

V\u000a\u000aOn reading the comments of others left on the page i was surprised. I\u000awould\u000arate this as worthy of being 3rd in the top 250. The film may not be an\u000aaction packed ride from start to finish as you may expect a jail break to\u000abe, but this is because it is not what the film is meant to be about. If\u000ayou\u000ahave read Kings original short story you will see that the adaptation of\u000athis film does it justice, as so many attempts of making films from his\u000abooks have not, with the exception of stanly kubrick's adaptation of the\u000ashining. The acting by tim robbins and morgan freeman only adds to the\u000aprominence of this film in expressing the adversity that was suffered by\u000aprisoners back in the 40's. \u000a

V\u000a\u000aThis film should not be(as many else films)in top 3 of the 250 best films\u000aever made.First I want to say something about the acting, that is one of the\u000athings that makes this one so good.Morgan Freeman is fantastic and so is Tim\u000aRobbins(both of them are very good actors even if Freeman is better).The\u000ascript is also fantastic and the whole complex of the film is\u000abrilliant.It´s a film that might will bring you to tears, even if it in the end goes\u000ato far and everything becomes silly.I mean it could they could have cut out\u000athe last fifteen minutes but it´s still a frightening film.The message in\u000athe film are that you will survive as long as you have\u000ahope.4,5/5\u000a

V\u000a\u000aThis is one of the best movies I have come across. The acting of Tim Robbins\u000ais excellent but it is Morgan Freeman as Red who steals the show with a\u000abreathtaking performance. The story continually kept me interested and Tim\u000aRobbins' struggle against nearly every inmate in shawshank. Its possibly\u000aonly his great friendship with Red that keeps him sane.It was also strange to see one of the sisters in the movie who continually\u000atry to rape Tim Robbins, played marine hard man Drake in "Aliens", which is\u000aalso one of my all time favourites.Great movie. Rating 9/10.\u000a

V\u000a\u000aHaving read the King novella, i was very anxious to see this movie, and when\u000ai did, i was pleasantly surprised. It was pretty faithful to the novel, and\u000athe casting, score and direction were superb.\u000aThen i saw 'Escape from Alcatraz'.\u000aNow, i am one of Mr. King's biggest fans; i have all of his novels and would\u000abe the first to defend him as a brilliant author. But....well, i can't\u000areally go much farther without thinking of the word 'plagiarism'.\u000aNow, i know that may be a trifle strong, but when i actually started to\u000athink about all the similarities between these two movies, i'm sure you will\u000aagree it is suspicious to say the least.\u000a1. In Shawshank, Andy hides his rock-hammer inside the Bible. In Alcatraz,\u000aMorris hides his nail file inside the Bible.\u000a2. In Shawshank, Brooks rescues and feeds a blackbird which he feeds at the\u000atable. In Alcatraz, Litmus rescues and feeds a mouse which he feeds at the\u000atable.\u000a3. In Shawshank, Andy escapes by tunneling through his wall with said tool.\u000aIn Alcatraz, Morris escapes by the same method.\u000a4. In Shawshank, Andy releases the dirt from his cell excavation by dropping\u000ait down his trouser legs. In Alcatraz, Morris does the same\u000athing.\u000a5. In Shawshank, the prison warden is a corrupt individual who takes a\u000adisliking to the central character. In Alcatraz, the warden also takes a\u000adisliking to Morris in much the same way.\u000a6. Both in Shawshank and in Alcatraz, Morris and Andy both take jobs in the\u000aprison library, distributing books to the inmates.\u000a7. The character of Red in Shawshank is almost an exact copy of the\u000acharacter of English in Alcatraz.\u000a8. The character of Brooks in Shawshank is very much the same role fulfilled\u000aby Litmus in Alcatraz, and both die in the movie.\u000a9. In both movies, the cenral character has to defend himself against the\u000agay inmates, and has several altercations with them (Wolf in Alcatraz, and\u000athe 'Sisters' in Shawshank). The prison shower scene is an almost exact copy\u000aof the scene in Alcatraz.\u000a10. Instead of painting (used as a metaphor for freedom and hope in\u000aAlcatraz), Shawshank uses music to symbolize Andy's undying hope. In fact,\u000athe speech given by Andy about "they can't take the music away from me"\u000aalmost echoes that of Doc in Alcatraz, who says something very similar about\u000ahis paintings.I now find it hard not to think of Shawshank as a re-make of "Escape from\u000aAlcatraz".\u000aHowever, both movies are well worth watching in their own right, but i have\u000anever felt the same about Shawshank after seeing Alcatraz, and knowing that\u000ait was made almost 20 years before Shawshank was even written.\u000aAnyway, a very good movie none the less.\u000a

V\u000a\u000aThis film is one that I consider under-appreciated. It captures the essence\u000aof human nature, in every one of its 142 minutes. Fear, humanity, love,\u000aanger and courage are just a few emotions and traits shown on film in this\u000amasterpiece. In the IMDB top250 films, it comes third behind Lord of The\u000aRings: The Fellowship of the Ring and The Godfather. While good films in\u000atheir own league, they don't compare to the magnificence of The Shawshank\u000aRedemption. 'Shawshank' is set in America in the 1950s-70s. It tells the story of Andy\u000aDufresne, who is sent to Shawshank Prison for a double murder, that of his\u000awife and her lover. The film shows us the relationships he develops with\u000afellow prisoners, especially of that with Red, real name Ellis Boyd\u000aRedding.\u000aTim Robbins' gentle, yet powerful portrayal of Andy touches the heart of the\u000aviewer and makes him likeable. Morgan Freeman should have won the Oscar for\u000awhich he was nominated for portraying Red, the man who 'can get things'. He\u000ais a charming character that makes you want to see this film at least once\u000amore, and many of his lines stick in the memory. For instance, when Andy\u000atells Red he wants him to get Rite Hayworth for him, Red tells him he'll try\u000ahis best. Andy is still unsure, until 'I don't have her down my pants right\u000anow, Andy, but I'll get her for you!'\u000aIf you have never seen 'The Shawshank Redemption', go down to the nearest\u000avideo shop and rent it. No, don't rent it, BUY it. It'll be the best few\u000aquid you ever spend on entertainment. \u000aStacy_G_   \u000a

V\u000a\u000ai have to admit i am very cynical when it comes to movies that are adapted\u000afrom an already written story/book. but this one was absolutely riveting. i\u000aam sure by now you already know the whole story line what it is about and\u000awhat is good and bad about it... but i have to say this-i live very faraway\u000afrom home and when i got to watch this movie i was horribly depressed and\u000aready to get into some serioius wallowing in self pity but the movie showed\u000ame two things\u000a1)that there are people who have it alot worse then i do and they certainly\u000adont deserve it and\u000a2) there is hope for everyone but you are the one who keeps it in you and\u000ano\u000aone can do that for you. The way Andre did it was sterling and it really\u000areally touched me.\u000aof course i knew the ending how it would be and i still felt gratified and\u000atouched when i saw it. i read someone saying that how could a murderer be\u000achanged to the extent that they behave like Morgan Freeman did as Red and i\u000asay that if that person would actually go and visit someone in prison they\u000awould find people filled with regret and that are surviving in a warped\u000ahell\u000aon earth that for most and i mean most consumes their mind and leave them\u000awithout human characteristics. i guess some deserve it but i think that\u000asome\u000asurely dont. what can i say? i think that the movie deserves to be called\u000aone of the greatest of all time and i have always loved Tim Robbins\u000aanyway... i think i am the only Kenyan who even acknowledges his existence.\u000a\u000a

V\u000aHaving just seen this wonderful movie, the question I ask myself is\u000athis: why in the world did I wait so long?? Based on a memorable short\u000astory by Stephen King, 'Shawshank' is a quietly brilliant parable about\u000ahope and perseverance and, yes--as stated in the title--'redemption.'\u000aTim Robbins gives a beautifully understated performance as Andy\u000aDufresne, a well-to-do banker sentenced to two double life terms in\u000aprison for a murder he did not commit. At first quiet and\u000aintrospective, Andy slowly emerges as silently headstrong, resourceful,\u000aand filled with a sense of humanity that transforms not only himself,\u000abut his fellow inmates as well. Most effected by Andy's presence is his\u000aprison friend and ally, 'Red' Redding (played with a superb weathered\u000adignity by Morgan Freeman), who acts not only as the narrator and Greek\u000achorus in the film, but also as the collective conscience of the\u000ainmates themselves. Although the 'Mean Warden' might seem a stock\u000acharacter in prison films, Bob Gunton gives the role a new benchmark,\u000aoozing evil with every tight-lipped glare and succinctly uttered\u000asyllable. Having read the story by King several years ago, I knew the\u000aoutcome, but, watching the movie, it was no less wonderful and\u000agratifying when it arrived. The 'double ending' of this film--that is\u000ato say, what becomes of Andy and Red in turn--leaves the audience\u000atrembling with satisfaction and pleasure: redemption only comes with\u000ahonesty; hope is eternal; and music (be it Mozart or Hank Williams) is\u000amagic. For those who have not yet seen it, 'The Shawshank Redemption'\u000ais a 'must see'--for those who saw it years ago, take another visit.\u000aAnd then, during the closing credits over Thomas Newman's lovely score,\u000ado what I did--applaud.\u000a

V\u000a   ***SPOILERS***   ***SPOILERS***\u000aI was twelve when I first saw this movie in 1998. I was flipping through\u000athe\u000achannels on my TV when I was first introduced to the character of Andy\u000aDufresne. I watched with amazement and was fully absorbed by the\u000ahappenings\u000aand events that took place. When a commercial break came on, I was\u000aimpatient\u000afor it to end so I could find out what would be next.\u000aThe beginning of the movie has Andy being imprisoned for the murder of his\u000awife and her lover. He says he didn't do it. And I believed he did, until\u000athe plot twister changed my whole perspective. Red is the man narrorating,\u000aand to me, is the main character about how is life is changed around over\u000athe twenty years he knows Andy. And if it's anything that made me cry, it\u000awas at the end where Red is finally free.\u000aThis film started my compassion for movies with meaning behind them, and\u000aif\u000ayou view this picture, be ready for a new look on life.In other words, DON'T pass this movie by.

V\u000a\u000a**** SPOILERS HEREIN**** proceed at own risk!!!!!it is simply no wonder that shawshank redemption is as insanely popular as\u000ait is. the movie is the greatest flag-bearer for hope and the\u000adetermination.\u000ai have been wanting to see this movie for a long time and recently caught\u000ait\u000aon television as part of a stephen king horror special\u000aseries!!!!the movie begins at quite a slow pace and after about half an hour i was\u000awondering why this movie was so highly rated. but slowly the movie\u000aunravels\u000aand soon i was totally caught up in its brilliance. sometimes harsh,\u000asometimes serene, sometimes wishful, sometimes dreadful. the intensity of\u000athe despondence at shawshank prison is almost tangible.tim robbins and morgan freeman are outstanding in their roles. each\u000acharacter is brilliantly etched and is a delight to watch. the screenplay\u000ais\u000athe highlight of the movie and there is always a feeling of something\u000alarger\u000alurking behind the damp grey walls of shawshank.for those who have seen the movie, an interesting point would be that the\u000aname of stephen king's novella is "rita hayworth & the shawshank\u000aredemption". well well!!the movie though has to be watched. it is an experience every human should\u000ago through. it takes the light at the end of the tunnel to the next\u000aplane.an elevating 10!!\u000a

V\u000a\u000aIf you didn't like The Shawshank Redemption, then you don't understand the\u000aconcept of the film.  Shawshank is the epitome of good film-making -- a\u000afresh, interesting, verisimilar, detailed story coupled with acting that\u000amakes Tim Robbins stand out in my mind as Andy Dufresne himself.  The\u000aimagery is beautiful, the story has few, if any, holes, and Morgan Freeman\u000aplays the character of Red, the film's narrator, exceedingly well.  To those\u000awho find it unnatural that a murderer has matured into a wise, thoughtful\u000aman during a long tenure in prison, I suggest that there is no more logical\u000aplace for such a transformation.  Red has had 20 years (upon Andy's arrival)\u000ato think about the crimes of his youth, and has grown as a  result.   In\u000ashort, Shawshank is a movie for people who like good stories.  It will make\u000ayou laugh, it might make you cry, and in the end, you'll simply feel good\u000aabout life itself.\u000a

V\u000a\u000aI had been meaning to watch this movie for a long time, but I got the\u000achance\u000aonly yesterday, when I watched it on HBO. I can only say that for eight\u000ayears I had missed a chance to witness a brilliant work. Tim Robbins is\u000areally good, so is Morgan Freeman. But the movie is not about any central\u000acharacter. The movie as a whole is devastatingly perfect. I saw Forrest\u000aGump\u000aand thought it was awesome, deserving of the Oscar.

V\u000a\u000aNot even the best within the prison genre itself. After all the positive\u000acomments I heard, I was waiting for some fantastic ending or deep\u000aphilosophic message to come through. Neither did. The ending turns out to\u000abe\u000aas clichéd and predictable as most other movies in the genre. For those\u000awho\u000alike prison movies, just go and watch some A&E's investigative reports on\u000aAmerican penal system. They are way more realistic and gut wrenching than\u000athis film and they are free.On the other hand, let us not be too cynical either. It's obvious that a\u000alot\u000aof good work have been put into this film. Morgan Freeman's work alone is\u000aworth the money of the movie. The other highlight is Mozart's music over\u000athe\u000aintercom, which completely captivate the inmates. The scene is deeply\u000aphilosophical and the music therapeutic.  But still, it is somewhat\u000aunbelievable, as how many prison inmates really dig Mozart? If they did,\u000athey probably wouldn't have ended up behind bars in the first place. But\u000ahey\u000athis is Hollywood.It's not a must see movie unless you have never seen a prison film before.\u000aBut it is an entertaining one to kill some time for a Friday night when\u000ayou\u000ahave run out of things to do. So for my money, it is worth\u000a7/10.\u000a\u000a

V\u000aThe Shawshank Redemption, is one of those films, that stays in your mind\u000along after the credits role off the screen. It is nothing short of a\u000aMasterpiece, adopted from a story written by Stephen King, Entitled "Rita\u000aHayworth and The Shawshank Redemption". The story takes place in the\u000a1940's,\u000ain New England, and opens with the murder Trial of Andy Dufresne (Tim\u000aRobins), who is being tried over the murder of his wife and her lover.\u000aAndy\u000ais sentenced to life imprisonment, over a crime which he maintains he did\u000anot commit.It is here, confined within the grey stone walls of the Prison, that he\u000ameets "Red", played superbly by Morgan Freeman. Red and Andy become the\u000amost\u000aunlikely of friends, and over the years their friendship\u000agrows.\u000aAndy shows Red that there is always hope, even in the bleakest of\u000acircumstances, and Hope is what will set you free.The Shawshank Redemption is remarkable in every aspect. The storyline is\u000afantastic, and the director pays a lot of attention to every part of it.\u000aThe\u000aprison cellar shots are extremely realistic, even though they are built on\u000aa\u000agiant set. The acting is supurb, from the lead characters to the\u000asupporting\u000acast. All in All, this film is nothing short of Brilliant, and will go\u000adown\u000aas the greatest film i have ever seen. 10/10\u000a\u000a

This movie truly belongs among the greats, such as\u000aThe Godfather, Citizen Kane, and Schindler's List, and this is the\u000aonly movie I would place above the others in this elite group. \u000aThere is no single element that makes it such a fantastic movie;\u000athe combination of every aspect of the movie being executed\u000aperfectly makes it great.

V\u000a\u000aShawshank is a movie which somehow trancends the whole of its parts. In\u000aall\u000arespects, this is a movie that has no right to work as well as it does.\u000aThere are so many opertunities where a director and a cast of lesser\u000ainstincts could have delved into schmatlz, yet the ensemble remains\u000asteadfast as the story unwinds. Make no mistake, this an uplifting tale\u000awhich uses the ubiquitous happy "Hollywood" ending. Not only does it take\u000aplace in the forties, it also seems that the movie itself was a product of\u000athe studio era of Hollywood cinema, with a plot and pathos that would have\u000aworked in the best of Capra's films.\u000aShawshank, as a result, requires us to check the most "nintees" of all\u000amindsets in the process, cynicsm. Shawshank is all about faith in the\u000ahuman\u000aspirit and freedom, and how both are impossible to lose as long as you\u000abeleive in yourself -- Not exactly a bromide for present day society. That\u000athis movie remains popular is evidence that we still thirst for\u000aCapra-esque\u000amovies that shy away from cynicsm.Shawshank , unlike most modern films, wears no self-aggrandizing snear. It\u000aproudly wears earnestness and faith, while other movies try to mock such\u000afeelings. Is Shawshank the most intelligent movie around? No, certainly\u000anot.\u000aIs it the most philosphically groundbreaking? Not at all. Will it change\u000athe\u000aface of movies? I don't see it as likely. Instead Shawshank is a timeless\u000apiece  whose story will leave it's mark on those who approach it with an\u000aopen mind. It won't change your life, but it will make you walk higher,\u000alook\u000afarther, and hope harder that such a story can exist is a world where so\u000afew\u000atales of redemption come without a snear. \u000a

V\u000a\u000aThe Shawshank Redemption is a great piece of storytelling,which moves at a\u000aslow pace but is a rewarding experience. Tim Robbins plays Andy Defresne,\u000aa\u000agifted accountant who is wrongfully imprisoned for the murder of his wife\u000aand her lover. The story focuses on all of Andy's struggles during his\u000atime\u000aat Shawshank, but is told by Red(Freeman)who forms a close friendship with\u000aAndy. Robbins gives what many consider to be the best performance of his\u000acareer, while Freeman shines in a role that earned him a well deserved\u000aOscar\u000anomination. I would consider Shawshank to be one of, if not the greatest\u000afilm i have ever seen. Why in the blue hell the academy gave the best\u000apicture award to Forest Gump baffles me to this day. Don't get me wrong,\u000aGump was a good film but when you look at all the polls concerning the\u000agreatest film of all time more often then not Shawshank will be in the top\u000atwo or three, while Gump will be nowhere in sight. Gump may have got the\u000aOscar, but Shawshank's the film everyone will be talking about for years\u000ato\u000acome.\u000a

V\u000a\u000aThis movie is the best drama I have ever seen. The acting was powerful. The\u000aplot was powerful. The mood was powerful. It must just be luck or if not,\u000aextreme skill to make a movie so good as this. Every actor in this movie\u000atakes life as serious as he really would in life, from the evil warden to\u000aRed to Andy--they all make it worth while. This is probably one of the few\u000agood prison movies out there (Green Mile was excellent too), but it is soooo\u000agreat! The ending makes it all worth while also, being the best part of the\u000amovie (I'm not going to say any spoilers, but just let me say that you'll\u000afind out a lot more than you expected). I can't imagine how much pain you\u000awould have to go through to be wrongfully imprisoned for so many years. If\u000ayou are sensitive about subjects like this, don't see the movie. But if you\u000alove drama at any level, I HIGHLY recommend this movie to you. It definitely\u000adeserves its high rank in the top 250. Go ahead and see it--you won't be\u000adisappointed. 10/10.\u000a

He came to the\u000aprison as a young man, as a young black in a time of racism.\u000aAnd in this prison, under conditions of violence and cruelty, he developed\u000ato an one of the most friendly, wise and honor figures ever seen in cinema\u000a?\u000aAt the end of the movie you can ask your self: is there a better place to\u000aform human characters as a prison ?\u000aOnly the reflection of the spirit and meaning of friendship, separated\u000afrom\u000athe story, is developed to less to say this film has a deeper meaning\u000awhose\u000aimportance cover his lacks.\u000aShawshank Redemption is a very good movie to spend an nice evening, but I\u000acan not agree with those who find that is the best movie ever\u000amade.\u000a(7/10)\u000a\u000a

I was also\u000avery bothered by the lack of racism portrayed in the film.  Racism is a\u000avery\u000abad thing, but it was also so very pervasive in the 1930's that portraying\u000ait as basically nonexistent is tantamount to historical revisionism.

How we deal with\u000athose injustices shape our lives or end our lives.  In Shawshank we see\u000ahow\u000aone man is dealt with one of the largest injustices known to man, and\u000aaccepts the injustice.  He never asks for sympathy, for he believes in a\u000away\u000ahe deserves his fate.  However, when the new world that he enters deals\u000ahim\u000aa new hand of unfairness, our man once again accepts the misdeeds that are\u000adealt him.

V\u000a\u000aProbably the best Stephen King film adaption ever, but you don't have to\u000abe\u000aa King fan to enjoy this awesome movie. The plot centers around the\u000a(wrongful?) incarceration of Maine banker Andy Dufresne(excellently\u000aportrayed by Tim Robbins) after being convicted for the murders of his\u000awife\u000aand her lover. However, the film (AND story....read it) go beyond that and\u000adetail the cruel, corrupt inner workings of the prison, the emotional and\u000amental state of the inmate, and the conflict of inner bars versus outer\u000aones. The supporting cast is also uncommonly good, led by heavyweight\u000acharacter-actor Morgan Freeman as the veteran con "get-it-guy" Red. With\u000amoments of brutality, beauty, humor, and an unexpected twist, The\u000aShawshank\u000aRedemption is easily one of the best films in recent cinematic history.\u000a\u000a

One of the reasons why it was so good is the voice-over in the film.\u000aMorgan Freeman has a superb reading voice and works well as a\u000anarrator.\u000aI think the best scene is when Andy plays the opera music and all the\u000aprisoners look up to the speakers as if it is a God or idol.

V\u000a\u000aFrank Darabont, writer and director of 'The Shawshank Redemption' has done\u000aa\u000areally good job with this movie. I have never read the Stephen King short\u000astory but I would imagine that it and the movie are pretty similar. First\u000aof\u000aall the screenplay is what contributes most to the movie. The relationship\u000abetween Andy Dufresne, an eccentric loner, and 'Red', a popular and lively\u000aperson, itself makes for an excellent story but with the prison\u000aenvironment\u000aand the other interesting charaters involved, the movie is even much\u000abetter.\u000aThis film is pretty much dominated by the characters. The movie takes\u000aplace\u000aover about 20 years and in that time the film not only focuses on Andy and\u000a'Red' but other characters that leave and arrive. 'The Shawshank\u000aRedemption'\u000ais a character film. I've never thought that Tim Robbins has been a good\u000aactor but this does not bring down the movie. Morgan Freeman acts\u000aexcellently as usual and William Sadler and Bob Gunton also give excellent\u000aperformances. The cinematography and music for this film are also actually\u000anoticable.The mood of 'The Shawshank Redemption' in my opinion has been created spot\u000aon. The movie balances well between lighter and darker incidents and after\u000athe movie was finished I had a feeling of satisfaction. The film is filled\u000awith many scenes that are a delight to watch and every different event\u000athat\u000ais emphasised in the movie are not only interesting elements of the film\u000abut\u000aalso contributes to the overall movie, in that they change and effect\u000aAndy's\u000afeelings of his place in the Shawshank prison. I can't believe that this\u000afilm was nominated for seven Academy Awards and didn't win any. If ever I\u000ahad to say that a film was completely perfect, 'The Shawshank Redemption'\u000awould be it.  \u000a

Sure, The Godfather\u000atriology and Seven Samurai were great movies too, but they were way too long\u000aand I felt they rather gave me pain in the buttocks than a touch in my mind.\u000aThis movie, on the other hand, has this distinguished feature; you don't\u000awant it to end. I haven't felt that way since I watched the Matrix at the\u000acinema back in its old glory days (that goes for both the movie The Matrix\u000aand cinemas, they're out of date nowadays :)). It also made very clear to me\u000athat I never want to go to an american prison, just as little as I would\u000alike to go to a turkish prison...\u000a

V\u000a\u000aThis is one of those rare films that actually exceeds the book by which it\u000awas based upon.  It's that good.  Not only is this a damn good  flick, it\u000aactually made me a fan of Tim Robbins and told me what I already knew about\u000aMorgan Freeman; He's one of the best actors alive.  I really can't say much more.  This is one of my favorite movies ever and\u000athere is no way that I can make that point any clearer.  If, for some\u000areason, you haven't already seen this, go get it now!!!  If you don't,\u000ayou're seriously depraved.  What a movie!!!!\u000a

V\u000a\u000aOne of the best films of its type, only bettered by Frank Darabont's other\u000aperiod prison drama based on a Stephen King story "The Green Mile". Mr\u000aDarabont and Mr King appear to have hit on the perfect partnership, in\u000amaking fantastic films based in prisons and set in days gone by. Morgan\u000aFreeman and Tim Robbins are both excellent in this movie, although Mr\u000aFreeman is always excellent (especially in his high school drama "Lean on\u000ame"). Well done to all concerned in this excellent production, and let's\u000ahope that Mr Darabont and Mr King continue in this successful vein for the\u000afuture\u000a

V\u000a\u000aThis movie is excellent. That is the best word to describe this movie. Tim\u000aRobbins was in top form as Andy who claims innocence to the criminal\u000acharge\u000aof murder and Morgan Freeman was very believable as Andy's friend, Red. I\u000afound this film to be very real yet at the same time it had a layer of\u000amagic\u000ato it. The characters were all very interesting to watch, some warm and\u000abrotherly, others frightening and souless. Even though I am female, I felt\u000aa\u000akinship to Andy and found myself in his corner routing for him the whole\u000atime. He did not fail those of us that were watching.

V\u000a\u000aI had resisted the temptation to see this movie for quite a while, even\u000athough it was recommended to me by many friends, and I was quite impressed\u000aby the high rating on IMDB. However, I have finally seen the movie now,\u000aand\u000aI can only say that I am very impressed.I can only say that this movie is as flawless as any movie can be. It is\u000aamazing to me how a movie with barely any action can grip you like this\u000aone\u000ajust through the story, the acting and the excellent character\u000adevelopment.\u000aThe characters are extremely real and believable, and it is easy to\u000aidentify\u000awith Tim Robbins' character.Tim Robbins was actually the biggest surprise for me in this movie, and\u000athis\u000ais by far the best performance I have seen of him. However, it seems that\u000ahis acting style matches the material very well. Andy Dufresne (Tim\u000aRobbins)\u000ashould not be someone who is overly emotional, and this seems to be the\u000aperfect character for Tim Robbins.However, the most moving performance in the movie came from James\u000aWhitmore.\u000aI will not spoil the movie by going into details, but even though his\u000acharacter's story is only a subplot, it is one of the strongest points of\u000athe whole movie, and his performance is absolutely memorable.Still, with all the great performances, the star of this movie is its\u000astory.\u000aIt is the story of someone who is objectively innocent when he goes to\u000ajail,\u000aand who loses a large part of his life in jail, but when he comes out of\u000athe\u000ajail, he is still a better person, because he has found his true self. The\u000astory proves that a person does not have to be guilty of a crime in the\u000afirst place to find redemption, but that redemption can happen on many\u000adifferent levels.\u000a\u000a

V\u000a\u000aCONTAINS SPOILERS\u000a"The Shawshank Redemption" is a film about banker Andy Dufrense(Tim\u000aRobbins) who is framed and sent to a maximum security prison for the murder\u000aof his wife and her lover.He befriends Red Redding(Morgan Freeman), who is\u000athe only guilty man in Shawshank, the prison.  Through a few brutal years,\u000aAndy finally manages to get through.  He helps prisoners graduate high\u000aschool, opens a prison library, and works on the taxes for the crooked\u000awarden(Bob Gunton). Little does anybody know what his secret is, an escape.Based on a short story by Stephen King from 'Different Seasons', this is\u000athe best film about the triumph of the human spirit.  Frank Daranbot\u000adelivers a top notch drama.  This film also features an excellent musical\u000ascore by Thomas Newman.  Morgan Freeman delivers,in my opinion, his best\u000arole.  Though a little cruel at some points, this film will make you want\u000ato\u000asee it again.  One of the three best films of the 1990s.  Second on my all\u000atime list.\u000a

V\u000a\u000aThis I have to say was one of my favorite movies of all time. I didn't see\u000ait until 1998 though. I had heard about it, but never actually had seen it.\u000aBut when I did, I went out and bought it on video. I've always liked Morgan\u000aFreeman and Tim Robbins has become a favorite of mine too.\u000aFor some reason I like prison movies. It's just the suspense that really\u000agets me. Movies like Escape From Alcatraz, The Green Mile, Instinct, and The\u000aLast Castle are among my favorites. To anyone who has not yet seen this\u000amovie, go rent it tonight, you will not be disappointed!\u000a

V\u000a\u000aLike "Pearl Harbor," (AAAHHH!) this film had comedy despite the fact that it\u000awas a drama. For example, when Andy is ordered to turn off music that is\u000aannoying to the Warden (but not to the rest of the prison... they just\u000alisten), Andy turns it up!But, unlike "Pearl Harbor" (AAAHHH!), this film actually needed a bit of\u000aGOOD laughter, whereas "PH" (AAAHHH!) was laughable in itself, with\u000aunneccesary BAD comedy.Anyway, I read the novella first and let me tell you, the film (edited-I\u000awatched on TNT) has many differences and add-ons. For example, that bit of\u000acomedy wasn't in the book (heck, NO comedy was in the book). Also, (spoiler)\u000awhen Andy has disappeared, the Warden didn't throw his hand-carved chess\u000apieces at the poster-he tore it down. Also, the novella wasn't 100 pages,\u000awhereas this movie (on TNT, with commercials and edits) was 3 hours\u000awhole!I am STILL deciding on where to put this better-than-most-films-these-days\u000amovie on Favorites list. I am tempted to put it near the top (not at the\u000atop-there are better films), but somewhere online someone said that it was a\u000amiddle-movie (an okay one). Another person declined, but after watching\u000aagain, they agreed. So, I'll put it somewhere in the middle.I liked it very much, but it's not my favorite movie ever, nor the second.\u000aRather... ah, heck, I can't decide right now!Rating: 4.5/6\u000a

V\u000a\u000aI realize that my screen name might belie my opinion of the film, but I\u000ahave\u000aseen it several times and still find it difficult to forget.  The\u000aShawshank\u000aRedemption is the finest film I have ever seen, and I would recommend it\u000ato\u000aanyone over the age of 13.While there are some scenes that warrant an R rating, they are done\u000aprofessionally and are used to tell a story--not to simply shock the\u000aviewer.\u000aThe plot is deep and twisting, but is not difficult to understand on a\u000abasic level.What makes Shawshank better than most films, however, is the use of\u000aseveral\u000asub plots (often metaphors) to enhance the tale of Banker Andy Dufresne\u000aand\u000aEllis "Red" Redding (Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman, respectively).  Both\u000ado\u000athe finest work of their careers, in my opinion, in this\u000afilm.Even more amazing is the cinematogrophy.  Director Frank Darabont made his\u000adebut with Shawshank, and captures old Mansfield Penitentiary wonderfully.\u000aI can't say that I enjoy watching any movie more than this one.\u000a\u000a

V\u000a\u000aI first heard about The Shawshank Redemption in a conversation with a new\u000afriend. She said that it was one of her all time favourite films. The way\u000ashe mentioned it....I don't know. I just had to borrow\u000ait!I'm glad I borrowed that video. The way to do it is to get nice and comfy\u000ain\u000aa private place with some ice cream or something. Eliminate all\u000adistractions\u000aand you will be guaranteed to be drawn into the movie. Or to be simple\u000aenough.....watch it on your own. Other people can ruin\u000ait!You are introduced to Andy Deufresne, a banker who is sent to prison for\u000alife after being wrongly accused of murdering his wife and her lover.\u000aBefore\u000ayou know it, you witness the brutal things that happen in a 1940s prison.\u000aBeatings, murders, rape etc. But among all this brutality, he strikes up\u000aan\u000aextroardinary friendship with a fellow inmate called Red, a man who knows\u000ahow to get things from the outside.With his banking skills and his natural spirit, Andy gradually makes\u000achanges\u000ain that dark and miserable prison that touches all of his inmates in\u000astrange\u000aways. To teach them all that nomatter how bad things get in life, there is\u000aalways something inside you that others can't get to. Something that's\u000apersonal and yours only. Hope.Without question, I give this movie 11 out of 10 for great acting, clever\u000aand touching quotes, and for just being a beautiful story. Something that\u000abeats Titanic and Forrest Gump. One of the best dramas I have seen If Andy\u000awas to comment on this film, he would say, "Get busy watching, or get busy\u000adying."\u000a

V\u000a\u000aThis film says everything about the world we live in today, but most\u000aimportantly give us a sense of hope in our future existence. As a film\u000awhich\u000abasic plot, if considered could of so easily been a flop at the box\u000aoffice.\u000aShawshank turns out to be a movie of the ages, through it stunning\u000acinematography, editing and directing, in no way forgetting its remarkable\u000aensemble crowned in my opinion by the astronomically well realised\u000anarration\u000aof Morgan Freeman. Tim Robbin execution of Andy not only boasts an inate\u000asense of naturalism that Stanislavski himself would be proud of but\u000acharacterisation that conveys all emotion that encycles the movie.

What a mistake.The story, the acting, the music, the message, etc. : everything was even\u000amore stunning than I'd hoped it to be. Huge waves of emotions. Simply\u000aincredible. Nothing less.This is a film that touches everyone that is lucky enough to take the time\u000ato watch it.

O, and don't forget to take notice the double moral\u000athat\u000awe all know so well from those very 'religious' people.Sorry for sounding a little hyper, but this film deserves\u000ait.Check it out!\u000a

V\u000a\u000aWith L.A. Confidential running a close second, this is the best film in a\u000asurprisingly good decade for movies.  Finally, somebody gets Stephen King\u000aright.  The film is based on one of his short novellas, and director Frank\u000aDarabont absolutely nails it.  Of course, he has a lot of help from Morgan\u000aFreeman, Tim Robbins, Bob Gunton, Clancy Brown, and Gil Bellows.  All give\u000aamazing performances.  Throw in Darabont's screenplay, Roger Deakins'\u000acinematography, and Thomas Newman's score, and you have a bonafide\u000amasterpiece.  If you don't dig this movie, please check your pulse.It's a real shame Hollywood did not know how to market this back in 1994,\u000abecause word-of-mouth came too late for the film to make money or win the\u000aOscars it deserves.  So when you see Shawshank for the first time, you'll\u000awonder how in the hell Forrest Gump won best picture.  To this day, I've\u000anever left a movie theater feeling better than when I saw The Shawshank\u000aRedemption.   \u000a

V\u000a\u000aThe Shawshank Redemption is one of the best movies ever, and the best\u000aperformance Morgan Freeman has delievered. I must say that Morgan Freeman\u000ahas to be one of the best actors of all-time. He is an intelligent actor who\u000adoes intelligent movies like Glory, Se7en, Unforgiven and Driving Miss\u000aDaisy. Tim Robbins also delievered an excellent performance. He played Andy\u000aDufresne, a city banker who is wrongfully accused of killing his wife and\u000aher lover. He is recieved a double life sentence for the crime, and is sent\u000ato Shawshank prison in 1947. Andy forms a friendship with the man who knows\u000ahow to get things around there, Red, played by Morgan Freeman. I won't tell\u000aanymore about the movie, but i will say at how amazed i was at this film. It\u000awas so well done. This is a must see. It is worth every penny of your money\u000awhen you rent this film, if you do.

The\u000aplot is brilliant, and once again it shows Morgan Freeman to be one of the\u000agreatest actors of all time; it amazes me that he has been given so few\u000aawards.When Tim Robbins was interviewed, he called this a "love story", and that is\u000aexactly what it is - a story of a wonderful (and completely non-sexual) love\u000abetween two men, a love that is born in an incredible hell-hole and helps to\u000araise them out of it.\u000aIt's the sort of movie you can watch over and over again and never get tired\u000aof it.\u000a

V\u000aWhat I can say about Shawshank Redemption is that this movie really\u000atouches\u000ame. This is the movie of movies. And Frank Darabont did it again by\u000adirecting The Green Mile. Also Thomas Newman walked the path into my heart\u000aby the music he composed for this movie. Tim Robin as good as he can be,\u000athere is nobody who could perform and interpret that caracter as he did.\u000aMorgan Freeman is great as usual, but that's not new. Clancy Brown is\u000aabsolutely great as the sadistic Capt. Bob Gunton, William Sadler, Gil\u000aBellows everybody is so perfect for this movie. The best thing about\u000aShawshank Redemption is the music composed by Newman. The movie and the\u000amusic is so beautiful and perfect it can't be expressed in\u000awords.\u000a

Shawshank Redemption isn't just a movie about a bunch of guys in a\u000aprison, it's a movie about hope, friendship, and "coming through clean in\u000athe end."\u000a   The film is slightly over two hours long, and involving an amazing cast\u000aof well acted characters, amazing aerial shots, a wonderful score of music,\u000aand inspiration, and the ability to find strength in yourself, that maybe\u000ayou didnt' know was there.\u000a  It was a shame this film came out the same year as Forrest Gump, this\u000adeserved every award it was nominated for, I highly recommend to anyone to\u000asee this film, because it is among one of the best i've ever\u000aseen.\u000a

V\u000a\u000aThis movie is one of the best dramas that I have ever seen.  The movie\u000afollows the life of a hot shot banker who is convicted for the murder of\u000ahis\u000awife and her lover.  He proclaims throughout the movie that he is innocent\u000ahowever.  As the movie progresses we see things inside this prison that we\u000ahope never really happens.  There are incidents of brutality, graft, and\u000aeven murder.  The guards of the prison use the main character, Andy\u000aDufresne, talent as a banker to do their tax returns and the warden uses\u000ahim\u000ato make a fortune.  Andy said it best when he said, "The funny thing is -\u000aon\u000athe outside, I was an honest man, straight as an arrow. I had to come to\u000aprison to be a crook."  Everything was different inside the prison.  This\u000amovie shows that no matter what the conditions are they can never\u000acompletely\u000abreak someone's spirit which is shown by this movie's happy ending.\u000a

V\u000a\u000aWhen I first saw this film I was completely blown away, it was on T.V. late\u000aat night and I was recording it after hearing about it, but after it began I\u000acouldn't stop watching it, then again the next day. This film can not be\u000aviewed by anyone just once, everybodies performance in this film is\u000aexcellent, most notably the lead characters. direction, writing, just\u000aeverything is amazing, and the way it makes you feel when the film ends is\u000aquite unlike any film I have ever seen, and doubt ever will again. This is a\u000afilm that EVERYBODY just HAS to see, something that I have been telling all\u000amy friends since.To illustrate how good this film is I was once asked what my favourite films\u000awere, I was in a big group of people, in which many walks of life were\u000arepresented, I mentioned the Shawshank Redemption and every single person\u000athere gave out a sigh of appreciation and a slow nod.\u000a

V\u000aI am very disapointed to see that this very average american hollywood\u000afilm\u000ais rated as high as #2 on the top 250.Seeing as the many dozens of reviewers has written before me I will only\u000astate why this film qualifies as one of the most overrated films of\u000ahistory.The ONLY thing this movie has is the story and the cutting filmnarratology\u000aand even this does not stand out from the rest very much. Based on a\u000amediocre book, this film is a good display of craftsmanship, not art. The\u000away the film tells its story is not creative or new in any way, instead it\u000afollows existing hollywood tradition by the book.\u000a

V\u000a\u000aShawshank needs to be watched more than once to fully appreciate it. This\u000ais\u000aa story that is so disparaging at times you want to cry for the character,\u000aits so totally immersing that by the end, you feel everything that they\u000afeel\u000aand along with the happy ending, is laced the whole tragic waste of life\u000athat leaves you feeling sad as well. The film itself is simply the finest\u000apiece of film making in history. There are no self-indulgent filming\u000atechniques used, no abstract elements to the story and the acting is\u000asincere.Based on a story by Stephen King, your getting a character driven story\u000athat\u000ais acted superbly, the part of Red, played by Morgan Freeman could not\u000ahave\u000abeen cast any better, he is utterly superb, as is Andy, played by Tim\u000aRobbins and the rest of the supporting cast.If you haven't seen this film, shame on you!

V\u000a\u000aBased upon a novella written by Stephen King, The Shawshank Redemption is\u000aunique in that its delivery is more effective as a motion picture than as\u000aa\u000awork of literature. Enter Andy Defresne- a man convicted of crimes that he\u000adid not commit. Such is his reality, and our deepest fear. Tim Robbins\u000aoffers a stellar performance, depicting a realistic character weighed down\u000aby his situation, yet while in the presence of this adversity he does not\u000aabdicate hope. His tenacity is unparalleled, and is undoubtedly a\u000acharacteristic to be admired, if not imitated. Accompanying this man?s\u000aquest\u000ais a case study of the corruption inherent in American corrective\u000afacilities. While many atrocities are brought to light, the resulting\u000aproduct is one of the most life affirming movies I have ever viewed as\u000aAndy\u000aeventually reaches his 'destination.'\u000a

V\u000a\u000aTHE SHAWSHANK REDEMPTION (1994)\u000aRating: 10/10If there was ever any prison drama that deserved 11/10 The Shawshank\u000aRedemption would be it. This is an insightful, brilliant, amazing,\u000athundering, moving, adventurousit would take 3 review forms to list all the\u000aadjectives. From the first moment on the movie is quite simply a masterpiece\u000awith elegance, style, suspense, intelligence, violence, wit and maturity.\u000aEach scene in this masterful prison drama is a showstopper, we're never\u000abored and always intrigued. Even at a running time of 2½ hours the film\u000anever slows down its story and always keeps us glued to the seat with some\u000areally gripping scenes and conversations. Excellent performances from Tim\u000aRobbins and Morgan Freeman and a highly commendable directing and writing\u000adebut from the mastermind that is Frank Darabont make the film more worth\u000awhile. It is so rarely that a film like things comes along, it really makes\u000ayou wonder why Forrest Gump won the 1994 Best Picture Oscar when this is not\u000aonly the best film of 1994 but one of the top 5 best films ever\u000amade.\u000a

V\u000a\u000aThere's 2 kinds of people who watch this film - this who get it and those\u000awho don't.Of the latter category, yeah OK, it is just a film about a couple of guys\u000ain\u000aprison.  It's excellently acted, scripted, directed and filmed.  And yeah\u000ait\u000adoes have a great ending.But there's something more than that.  And this is where former category of\u000apeople come in.The film is about hope, and living with hope.  "Andy Dufrenes" (Tim\u000aRobbins)\u000ais imprisoned wrongly.  Where many people would have given up, he refuses\u000ato\u000ado so and throughout his time in prison, clings to that hope.  A journey of\u000a1000 miles is taken one step at a time.Contrast this to "Red" (Morgan Freeman).  He's become used to being in\u000aprison, he's institutionalised, his repeated parole refusals have meant\u000ahe's\u000agive up hope.  And like Brooks before him he knows that he wouldn't survive\u000aon the outside."Get busy living, or get busy dying", says Andy.  It's the hope that Andy\u000ahas carried throughout that provides the salvation, the redemption, for\u000aboth\u000ahimself and Red.I can't recommend this movie highly enough.\u000a

The acting can't be\u000afaulted, and the music really gives it a monumental feel. Brooks is a great\u000acharacter, as are all of the characters really, but if I had to pick one\u000aout, Brooks is the man.Not only is it entertaining, the subplots are great and there are some\u000aclassic lines. Like the warden at the start: "There are two things I\u000abelieve\u000ain; discipline and the Bible. Here you'll receive both. Put your trust in\u000athe Lord; your ass belongs to me.

V\u000a\u000a(Note: Some plot-spoilers included)Yes! That's right!  The Shawshank Redemption would like to report that it\u000awas robbed of seven thoroughly deserved Oscars.Why? From it's ascentive messages of hope to the powerful redemptive\u000aaffects\u000afelt - not only by the characters but also the audience, Frank Darabont\u000ahas\u000acreated a true masterpiece.We all know that Freeman and Robbins provide superlative performances,\u000awhile\u000aless credit is often given to James Whitmore as Brooks - the backdrop to\u000aRed's ultimate redemption - showing what could have happened to Red\u000awithout\u000aAndy.  An amazing assortment of minor characters litter this film, and\u000awhile\u000aadmittedly there are a lot of prison cliches, they manage to work -\u000acliches\u000aaren't always bad remember - they have to be said by a lot of people\u000afirst!Cinematography: Hello? Did you see the scene when Andy first arrives at\u000aShawshank with the overhead view of the prison - which shows emphatically\u000athe extent of the "closed wall" syndrome that leads to the\u000a"institutionalized" sections?  Ohh, and don't forget THAT scene - you know\u000awhat I mean - Andy using the recurring metaphor of water once he's\u000aescaped!\u000aThe metaphor of Christ's journey ending in the washing away of Andy's\u000amemories of Shawshank in his crucifiction pose takes the breath away.\u000aThis\u000afilm is truly special.After reading the original novella by Stephen King, I looked forward to\u000awatching the Shawshank Redemption when it was bought for me on video - and\u000aDarabont not only does a great job at directing, but his adaptation of the\u000anovella is superb as well.The ending, while not containing the big budget special effects that most\u000amodern films seem to require as a neccesity nowadays, is a wonderful\u000aconclusion to a film that reaffirms faith in humanity.\u000aThank you to all concerned in making the film. \u000a

V\u000a\u000aThe Shawshank Redemption is one of those films of which people used to say\u000a"they don't make 'em like that anymore". Well, Frank Darabont had the\u000acourage to do it and the world owes him a debt of gratitude. With the\u000aadvent\u000aof the 90s there was the feeling that Hollywood, and Hollywood audiences,\u000acould never again accept such a thoughtful, emotional and "feelgood" movie\u000aas Shawshank. It shouldn't have been made in this era but thank God it was.\u000aStick it in black and white and it could quite easily have come right out\u000aof\u000athe 50s along with It's A Wondeful Life. Most 90s films to which the\u000acritics\u000aautomatically responded with the word "classic", Pulp Fiction, American\u000aBeauty, Fight Club, may or may not endure "the test of time" but there's no\u000asuch doubts about The Shawshank Redemption.

V\u000a\u000aThis is the best story driven movie ever, and yet until the end it doesn't\u000ahave any forceful direction in plot, it doesn't need it. All the lead up is\u000aa natural story, which is allowed to evolve and expand in a way that is so\u000ahumanly aware and so subtle that it's remarkable. I remember showing this\u000amovie to some friends after I'd seen it and a parent walked in about\u000ahalfway\u000athrough and asked "was it good?" they all said it was enthralling and\u000aamazing, then the parent added "what's it about?". There was a pause,\u000abecause everyone realised that to summarise this movie would undermine what\u000ait is about in every way possible: every nuance and intricacy is important,\u000aand they deserve every minute of screen time that they are generously\u000aawarded. We grow into the characters so well that we aren't surprised by\u000ahow\u000athey behave, because we can understand it. Even the apparently crazy antics\u000aof Brooks is wholly comprehensible.\u000aThen there's the music, amazingly visual and emotionally abundant in\u000acontent. The movies so good that it doesn't need music to drive it, but\u000awhen\u000athe music is of such astounding quality you begin to get a real resonance\u000aof\u000amood, and an extra dimension of depth in the already amazing aesthetics of\u000athe cinematography.\u000aWhether everyone else is blown away by this movie doesn't bother me,\u000abecause\u000aI will know how lucky I am. Lucky that I came across this movie, and lucky\u000athat I get it... that I really get it, in a way obviously not everyone in\u000athe world can. Anyone reading this should just hope they will fall into\u000athis\u000acategory, and anyone who hasn't yet should just watch it again, and again,\u000aand again... (Please note, the ending is just as perfect as the rest of the\u000apackage, but in-case someone hasn't seen it yet, I don't want to give it\u000aaway).\u000a

V\u000a\u000aSpoiler Alert\u000aA few films can presume of the importance that a film like The Shawshank\u000aRedemption does. Shawshank Redemption is considered by some critics as one\u000aof the best movies in the story of American film (listed as #2 by the\u000aInternet Movie Data Base,http://www.imdb.com). For many other people the\u000afilm is considered as one of those films which theme is universal and that\u000atranscends throughout the ages and decades. And this is because topics like\u000afreedom, justice and injustice, greed and honesty, and perseverance are\u000amixed in a manner that specifies what the human condition is and will\u000abe.The performances given by Tim Robbins and the always acclaimed Morgan\u000aFreeman give the film the emotional touch that is easy to get as a viewer.\u000aThe story is centered in a person called Andy Dufrense who was convicted\u000afor\u000athe murder of his wife, him, being a young and intelligent banker was one\u000aof\u000athe most promising persons in his category, but all his potential was\u000abrought down with his conviction, undoubtely unfair since it is obvious a\u000aperson like Dufrense wouldn´t be capable of such a thing like murdering the\u000aperson he loved with all his heart. Also the story of the\u000a"institutionalized" Ellis Boyd "Red" Redding played wonderfully by Morgan\u000aFreeman, a man who lost all hope of ever going out even if he had already\u000apayed more than he had ever expected for his crime, until he met Dufrense,\u000awho as anyone could see teaches Red the meaning of what to have a dream is,\u000aeven if it takes you 20 years to accomplish it.Greed comes in form of Captain Byron Hadley played by lancy Brown, an\u000aunscrupulous man, who ironicly although he directed the place were the\u000a"bad" element of society is reformed he was no better than the ones he\u000asubdued. Hadley since he first met Dufrense sought in him his golden egg\u000agouse and used him to fulfill a fraud becoming Dufrense now into a real\u000acriminal, which he wasn´t until he got to jail. When the opportunity to\u000aprove Dufrense´s innocence comes, Hadley makes everything as possible to\u000aavoid that even though the assesination of a young person was in the\u000amiddle.\u000aAt the end, Dufrense escapes from jail through a hole he had dug for 20\u000ayears covering the evidence with several posters from the hollywood divas\u000afrom those times from Rita Hayworth to Jane Fonda.But, let´s talk about Andy Dufresne for a while, let´s take the scene at\u000athe\u000aroof of the building in which Andy gets beers for his coworkers in exchange\u000afor work. At the end of the scene we can see the smile of Andy, a happy\u000aman,\u000awho was happy with small little accomplishments. Andy was someone who was\u000atalented and yet, all he wanted was a yat in Puerto Vallarta near by the\u000abeach and that would be the heaven for him. In a world full of intelligent\u000apeople who use their talents to get to the top, andy was one who needed\u000alittle to be happy.Of course the success of this film is based on what most of the famous\u000afilms\u000ado, an utopic idea of society or how the human being should have been. Andy\u000ais the prototype of how all of us should be, never loose the sense of hope,\u000aalways fight for what you want, greed and money is not good, and of course,\u000abeing like this you will always succeed. After all, a movie that should be\u000aseen by everyone. \u000a

V\u000a\u000aThere are exceedingly few films that leave such strong impressions upon you,\u000aand even fewer that leave such impressions that have a meaning and a\u000apurpose.  "The Shawshank Redemption" is a message about hope.  What better\u000away to show its value than through a film about a man spending 19 abusive\u000aand miserable years in prison for a horrendous crime he didn't commit, and\u000afinally getting his freedom along with supreme revenge against those who\u000amistreated him.Films where virtually everything that takes place contributes to the story\u000aare also rare.  Everything in "Shawshank Redemption" had meaning; Andy\u000aearning beer for his fellow inmates, his two weeks "in the hole" for playing\u000amusic over the loudspeaker, and Brooks' realization that he couldn't survive\u000aon the outside are just few examples.  Throughout the movie, Andy's best\u000afriend Red maintained his sense of defeat, succumbing to the fact that he\u000atoo was becoming "institutionalized" as Brooks had been, while Andy, in his\u000asubtle ways, viewed everything in his life as an opportunity.....including a\u000atiny rock hammer that could bring him freedom "in 400 years".....or less! \u000aThe movie builds up the two opponents, hope vs. despair, for their final\u000abattle in the end.  After more than two hours of watching an innocent man\u000asuffer, I never expected to smile so much for the outcome of such a\u000afilm.On a more technical note, "The Shawshank Redemption" is a filming\u000amasterpiece.  The actor selection was perfect, the acting was impeccable,\u000aand the directing of it all supported the story with absolute\u000aprecision.Anyone who dislikes this film ought to be shunned from\u000asociety.\u000a

V\u000a\u000abut the #2 movie of all-time ??!!? It's all opinion, of course.  However, I doubt even Stephen King or Tim\u000aRobbins would vote for this enjoyable saga as the #2 all-time movie.  It is\u000aa marvelous adaptation of King's short story.  Robbins, Freedman, and Gunton\u000aare all terrific, as is James Whitmore in his short role. My biggest criticism is the slow detailing of Red's every move after being\u000areleased from prison, and before going after the fortune.  That part was a\u000abit labored and overlong.  Nonetheless, the movie was witty, exciting, and\u000awell-acted, but was purposefully limited in scope.  Very good, yes! \u000aExcellent? Perhaps.  Great?  I must demur on great.\u000a

V\u000a\u000aWhat a remarkable film this is. I remember the first time I saw it. It was\u000aon video, since I was only 11 when it came out, and I sat down, and I had\u000aheard that it was a terrific movie, but I had no idea just how truly GREAT\u000athis movie is. After the first viewing I knew it was one of my favorites.\u000aI've only seen it three times, so as not to wear it out, and each time, I\u000aam\u000ablown away.Morgan Freeman is already one of my favorite actors, (Along with Kevin\u000aSpacey, James Cromwell, and Edward Norton) and his performance here is\u000asimply the best of his career. His "Red" is a weathered man who has lost\u000ahope. He's not a "bad" man, even though he did kill a man in his youth.\u000aMorgan Freeman is calm and collected, yet his on-screen presence is so\u000apowerful. We are drawn to him, almost more-so than to Andy because Andy\u000akeeps to himself, while Red narrates. This is partly the point, to turn the\u000aaudience into an inmate. We only know as much as they do about him. He\u000aisn't\u000arevealed to us directly very much. And we eventually find out\u000awhy.I love the way the men of this prison use almost a hierarchy and establish\u000atheir own little kingdom, with the jail, obviously as their castle. I like\u000awatching Andy as he strives to be normal, doing whatever he can to get his\u000amind off of the fact that he's in prison. One of the film's best moments\u000acomes when Andy makes a deal that allows all of the roof workers to have a\u000abeer, and to just sit around, and be carefree for a few minutes. But for\u000aothers the prison is normal, all they know, their only life. They call it\u000a"institutionalized" but what it really means is hopeless. And it's a\u000aconstant battle to keep that from happening. And eventually it seems, that\u000aeveryone caves in to the fact that they will die at that\u000aplace.This is unquestionably one of the most powerful and moving films of all\u000atime. (WARNING: SPOILERS!!!) There are four ending sequences that come one\u000aafter another that move so fluidly and with such grace that I am in awe\u000ajust\u000athinking about it. 1. Andy's escape and all of the explanation that goes\u000aalong with it. The long tunnel of crap, Andy's joy in the pond while the\u000arain pours upon him. 2. The day after and everything that happens to the\u000awarden and the guard are done brilliantly. 3. Red's parole hearing. At this\u000apoint he just doesn't give a crap about anything anymore. He talks about\u000ahis\u000aregret, not because he thinks it will get him out, but so that they will\u000aknow that his punishment is not so much prison as it is wishing he could've\u000amade a better decision. Wishing that the young Red would've had guidance.\u000a4.\u000aThe reunion at the end while Red narrates. The most wonderful lines come\u000awhen he's on the bus, and we hear his voice over about how he has shrugged\u000aoff his "Institutionalization" and is ready to not know what happens next.\u000aThis is the absolute perfect tone to end the movie on. What sheer\u000abrilliance. It is sad that this film didn't win ANY Oscars. It certainly\u000adeserved to.   \u000a

V\u000a\u000aI must say that I was I little surprised to see the euphoric comments that\u000aother users have bestowed on The Shawshank Redemption. Although I\u000athoroughly\u000aenjoyed the film, I would not place it with the cinematic greats. It has an\u000aexcellent storyline that both surprises and ultimately satisfies, and is\u000awell acted. However, there is little flair in its direction and some of its\u000acharacters are a little cliched. To sum up, the Shawshank Redemption is an\u000aenjoyable film with some well thought out twists to the tale, but the 2nd\u000abest film of all time? I don't think so.\u000a

V\u000a	This outstanding work is coterminous with films like `The Longest Yard' and\u000a`Cool Hand Luke' in that it touches upon our ambivalence about prison\u000ainmates.  It is indicative of the dichotomous view that our society has in\u000aregard to the penal system when we can clarion lex talions among our fellow\u000acitizens yet identify with and cheer on movie criminals in theatres.  Quite\u000apossibly it is the underlying threat of being immured ourselves, as we\u000arealize that it is really a fine line that keeps us free.	Of course it takes more than a play on our hidden fears to produce a film\u000athis good.  It takes a good script, solid acting and characters that we can\u000agive a damn about, all of which are gathered here brilliantly.  Above all it\u000atakes a good story, and obviously Frank Darabont knew one when he adapted\u000athis Stephen King novella into a movie script (you never really can tell\u000awhat you will end up with when you endeavor to bring one of King's books to\u000athe big screen).  He also knows how to use a camera to draw us into the\u000aprison world and how to exploit the power of narration (assisted nicely by\u000athe warm voice and splendid diction of Freeman).	SPOLIER ALERT!!!  A truly great movie must have a truly great ending and\u000athis film actually has two.  They could have ended it right after revealing\u000athe circumstances surrounding the escape as Freeman explains that he just\u000amisses his friend and it would have been fitting, but they continued and\u000afinish with a fabulous moment on the beach as Freeman succinctly explains in\u000aa voice over, `I hope'.  For those of you who try to say that you could see\u000athe end coming a mile away---forget it; sell it to someone who's buying.   \u000a

Shawshank was much deeper, and i was a great\u000ainjustice.\u000aShawshank chronicled the relationship between two jailed\u000ainmate through the 40's, 50's and 60's.

'The\u000aShawshank Redeption' is not just an acute prison drama, it remains a\u000adetailed an emotional study of humanities endeavour against hardship and\u000arepression.

V\u000a\u000aThis one is a winner.  It was a sad movie... and unacceptable for young kids\u000ato watch but a real good movie.... \u000aI am a big fan of the two main actors.. Tim Robbins,, and Morgan Freeman. \u000aDoes anyone know if this movie was based on a true story?What a wonderful ending also... and as I said before in other comments, I\u000alove happy endings.\u000a

V\u000a\u000aComing into this film you really don't think that you will see a movie of\u000athis high caliber.  I think I have seen this movie over 30 times in my time\u000aon this planet and i look forward to viewing it many more times.  This is a\u000adrama which follows Andy Dufresne (Tim Robbins) as he has to serve a lengthy\u000ajail sentence for the murder of his wife.  Although he claims he is innocent\u000athe overwhelming evidence lands him in the Shawshank Prison.  At first sight\u000ahe is seen as "The tall drink of water with the silver spoon up his ass" and\u000ais doubted from the start.  He keeps to himself for the most part until he\u000ameets Ellis "Red" Redding (Morgan Freeman) and creates and special\u000afriendship with him.  \u000a        \u000aThis story line creates one of the most moving films of not even the 90's\u000abut dare I say of all time.  This is my favorite movie and will always be my\u000afavorite movie and I think that the performances by the whole cast (mostly\u000aRobbins and Freeman) deserve critical acclaim for their portrayal of two\u000apeople just trying to make it in life.  \u000a        \u000aThe musical score of this film is also astounding and excellent by Thomas\u000aNewman one of the most working film composers out there.  The Director\u000a(Frank Darabont) directors one of his prison dramas and most likely his\u000abest.  This film is emotional, intense, uplifting and should be seen by\u000aeveryone.  I give this film a 10/10, 4 stars, thumbs up and everything along\u000athose lines, please for the good of humanity see this movie laugh, cry and\u000aget busy living.\u000a

V\u000a\u000aSpoilers ahead...\u000aThis movie, which was entertaining from start to finish, had the greatest\u000aending that I have ever seen.  Too many movie makers have unhappy endings\u000ajust because it seems more realistic. (see Sean Penn's "The Pledge")  The\u000aending to this movie couldn't have been more perfect.  I'm usually pretty\u000agood at predicting how a movie is going to end, but this one had me fooled\u000aall the way.  Tim Robins and Morgan Freeman had great chemistry throughout\u000athis picture.  I encourage everyone to see it.\u000a

V\u000a\u000aA faithful telling of Stephen King's novelette "Rita Hayworth and\u000aShawshank\u000aRedemption", this movie explores a wide range of emotions without ever\u000afeeling sensational or melodramatic. It's a really good story told really\u000awell on film (unlike a lot of King adaptations).Tim Robbins is absolutely fantastic as the "fresh" inmate, radiating\u000aintelligence, courage, innocence, and mystery with equal ability. Morgan\u000aFreeman plays the wily veteran convict who forges a respectful friendship\u000awith Robbins, and since it's Freeman, you know he does a good\u000ajob.There's no special effects wizardry, no furious action, no steamy romance,\u000ano clever "Pulp Fiction" banter. It takes place virtually entirely in a\u000aprison, so there isn't much distraction with location, scenery, or\u000amovement.\u000aThis movie is pure story and character, which really makes you appreciate\u000ajust how amazing the performances are.The movie is basically the gradual discovery of what Robbins' character is\u000aall about--what he's done, what's he's thinking, how he's going to end up.\u000aThe strength of the acting, and the adherence to King's work does a superb\u000ajob in making you sincerely care about the past and fate of this\u000aman.There is also a good deal of subtle philosophical elements to the movie,\u000awhich doesn't hurt. Certainly the penal system as we know it is\u000aquestioned,\u000abut there is also a broader view of life itself, almost in the Victor\u000aFrankl\u000a"Man's Search for Meaning" kind of way, where the strength of the human\u000aspirit is tested to the extreme. What does it take to destroy hope and\u000ahappiness?There exists only a handful of movies that I'll ever rate a solid 10. This\u000ais easily one of them. \u000a

V\u000a\u000aAfter I saw Darabont's "Green Mile" I heard that he had another movie, and I\u000ahad to see it.  I taped Shawshank on TV and watched it, not expecting a\u000alot.\u000aWell, it wasn't as good as "Green Mile," but it was pretty darned close, and\u000ait was quite similar in terms of themes and character types.  I thought the\u000awarden was terrific.  I was so engrossed in the movie, I wanted to strangle\u000athe man myself.  Although many say the movie was predictable, I was quite\u000asurprised by the ending.  As in the case of the "Green Mile," the awards\u000aShawshank richly deserved were passed on to other, not so good,\u000afilms.\u000aThe only downside was the portrayal of the characters.  The movie basically\u000asaid that criminals are good guys, and the prison guards are villains. \u000aIsn't it the other way around?I give Shawshank a 9/10\u000a

When Brooks dies has got to be the saddest moment in movie\u000ahistory. I cried for a good 10 minutes. He let his bird go, and he took his\u000alife. Very sad stuff. It's great how they start up a library helping the\u000ailliterate inmates. It shows some of the atrocites that inmates go through\u000aeven if they are innocent. A VERY GREAT movie and probably the best of all\u000atime. I give it an A++++++.\u000a

V\u000a\u000aIt is a movie that focuses on principals and fundamental values of humans\u000abeings, such as freedom. It is a movie about dreams, and how to achieve\u000athem. About how someone can be a free man while prisoned. About how someone\u000acan be a prisoner, while living in open space. Indicating that you must\u000afirst change yourself internally to what you want to become and then\u000agradually achieve it. Difficulties are to come but nothing hurts unless you\u000aget your eyes off your dream.Institutionalization, is something that many people have been infected with,\u000abut they seem not to be able to understand it. You don't have to be in a\u000aprison to get institutionalised. Look around you and you will see a race of\u000aslaves fighting every day to defend their slavery. Watch the "MATRIX" and don't focus on the fighting scenes, but on the\u000ameanings spoken out by Morpheas during the first part of the movie. You will\u000athen notice the similarities between the two movies, both concentrating on\u000afreedom from a slightly different view angle.All the above are wooven around a firm and perfect cinematographic structure\u000aof excellent performances, brilliant shooting and atmosphere.If art is to cultivate people, meaning the focusing of people on principles\u000aand fundamental values, then "The Shawshank Redemption" is sure one of the\u000abest tools to fulfill this task. To me it is one of the few movies that justify the existance of film making.\u000aWithout such movies cinema would have been a mean of erosion of human\u000apersonalities.I have seen this movie 7 times and i keep watching it to remind me of things\u000athat everyday routine makes you forget. Things that give happiness to your\u000asoul, not your mind. Things that set worthwhile goals for someone. I believe\u000athat everyone needs such tools to help him go after his godgiven rights\u000awhich are neglected everyday due to the soul devastating slavery, our minds\u000aput us through. I can honestly say that this movie is the tool for\u000ame.Sure nobody is perfect and someone may point out weaknesses of this film.\u000aBut he is just missing the forest focusing on the first bush he comes\u000aacross. What a waste of an opportunity.I hope that other people like this film and may get something good out of\u000ait. I am sure this film won't fit with everyone because everyone is\u000adifferent. But it will always be one of the best film i have ever\u000aseen.\u000a\u000a

V\u000a\u000aThis is one of the best drama movies I've ever seen. It seems that Stephen\u000aKing's jail novels are always a success movies, as The Green mile was even\u000abetter than this. Homewer, these two movies are so different they really\u000acan't be compared.Tim Robbins plays one of his best (if not the best of all) roles and I\u000acould\u000anot imagine anyone else to this role. The story is stunning and this time,\u000athe movie is actually better than the book.When you start to watch this film, you can't stop, until the film ends.\u000aThat\u000adescribes how interesting and addictive this movie is.

V\u000a\u000aInterpretation, spoilers: Brooks represents complete complacency with life, so much so that any\u000adisturbance causes anxiety and suicidal ideation. Red also, for a time,\u000arepresents this complacency. This movie is not simply a prison story, its\u000amessage is generalized to mankind in general and it can be assumed that this\u000acomplacency also represents modern man's need for routine - to the detriment\u000aof authentic living. It takes an unjustly imprisoned man, Andy, to demonstrate to Red the\u000alife-or-death importance of hope and the freedom allowed by hope. As shown,\u000ahope entails slight fear because it necessarily interferes with order in\u000alife. Andy illustrates that this fear is a part of living, and renunciation\u000afrom it results in an ingenuine sort of living. Red soon realizes - given the rock hammer, the poster, and the mexico plans\u000a- that Andy had never given up his hope despite 19 years in prison. Hope and\u000aa sense of freedom and allowed even in prison, but not to all (music scene).\u000aFor Red, it takes an actual physical freedom to live with a sense of hope.\u000aAndy, by exuding auras of hope from the beginning - though he would be\u000aexpected to despair the most given his innocence - helps Red reach an\u000aepiphany of sorts; certainty and hope are mutually exclusive, and hope is\u000aalways to be preferred. The Brook's path is shirked, and Red chooses life in\u000aall of its confusion, because true hope is omnipotent.   \u000a

V\u000a\u000aShawshank is a favourite of the Imdb. Always in the top 5, lots and lots of\u000apositive comments. I personally know many people who call this their\u000aall-time favourite.I wont go that far, but it gets highest marks from me. Just see it. It is\u000athe simple tale of Andy, the wrongly-convicted straight-laced accountant and\u000aRed, the aging murderer he befriends in prison. They both enter and leave\u000adifferent people, and to truly appreciate this film, pay careful attention\u000ato that plot point. Who they are when they enter and who the are when they\u000aleave.This is not a perfect movie. It could have lost 20 minutes without taking\u000aaway anything, and some of the dialogue is trite. But it is nonetheless\u000apowerful and moving.It was not a box office or a video hit. But slowly and surely, largely\u000athrough this website, it has developed a large, loyal and ardent following.\u000aEven Roger Ebert has added it to this "Great Movies" list, even though it\u000adid not garner four stars on its release and did not make his top 10 of the\u000ayear.You will likely find that this movie will grow on you. It is very watchable\u000aand like a good wine, improves with age. **** out of ****.\u000a

Unless you're completely repulsed by\u000athe idea of a prison film, or if you're too immature to appreciate good\u000adrama, you're going to absolutely love, love, love this film.  This film was\u000alargely overlooked at the time because of the mega-popular "Forrest Gump"\u000a(an extremely excellent film in its own right), but it holds up because of a\u000atimeless quality that very few films possess (I know the film's only 7 years\u000aold, but I think that's long enough).  If you're uncomfortable with some of\u000athe more graphic themes of the movie, it's still worth a look (certain cable\u000anetworks regularly show an edited for TV version of the movie).

V\u000a\u000aThis is a story about the despair of life in prison, as well as the\u000afriendship and hope that can be found and maintained within its walls,\u000aagainst all odds.As mentioned above, and as far as I am concerned, this movie is the best of\u000aall time.  I have lost count of the number of times I have seen this movie,\u000aand it touches me every time I watch it.  As a matter of fact, I just\u000afinished watching this movie on television, on a cable channel that cannot\u000aseem to get enough of showing this film.  I'm sure you know the one I mean,\u000abecause they have shown this movie dozens of times, usually back to back. \u000aIf you are a fan of this film, I'm sure you watch it every time it is on,\u000amuch like I do, and are always amazed, yet again, at the end of\u000ait.This film is written so eloquently that I doubt much could top it.  Having\u000anot read the original short story by Stephen King (which is titled "Rita\u000aHayworth and the Shawshank Redemption"), I cannot comment on the accuracy of\u000athe movie in relation to his telling of story.  However, I'm sure that it\u000adoes justice to King's writing.  Frank Darabont, who wrote the screenplay\u000aand directed Shawshank, also wrote the screenplay for and directed King's\u000aother prison film, The Green Mile, which also should not be\u000amissed.The acting here is excellent, but I doubt anybody would be surprised at\u000athat, given the cast present here.  Morgan Freeman (Se7en, Deep Impact, Kiss\u000aThe Girls) has shown time and time again that he is one of Hollywood's best\u000aand most underrated actors, and he certainly shines here as Red, the man who\u000a"knows how to get things."  Freeman's narration is superb, I doubt a better\u000ajob could have been done by anyone else.  In the history of film, people\u000asuch as James Earl Jones and Martin Sheen never fail to provide narration\u000athat is highly eloquent, but this film shows that Freeman deserves to be in\u000athe same category as those two actors.  Tim Robbins does a great job as Andy\u000aDufresne, an innocent man who knows he will remain in prison for a long time\u000ato come, but refuses to give up hope.Despite excellent writing and acting, however, I believe the most poignant\u000athing about this film is the score.  Present at the best times, and lacking\u000awhen it should be, the use of the score for this film helps set the tone and\u000athe mood for almost every scene.  Obviously, in a film set in a prison,\u000athere isn't much happiness to go around.  However, certain scenes in this\u000afilm are defined by the score that goes with them, making the viewer look\u000atwice at a scene which would otherwise be quite drab and seemingly\u000aunimportant, and making them appear different than they are, thus impressing\u000athe theme of hope on the viewer in an almost subconscious\u000afashion.Historically, of course, this film will never be viewed with the respect and\u000ahonor it deserves, especially with newer, more appealing prison-based films\u000aavailable, such as the aforementioned The Green Mile.  It is unfortunate\u000athat Shawshank didn't win the Academy Awards it was nominated for, because\u000ait certainly deserved them.  However, during its Oscar year, it was up\u000aagainst a little Tom Hanks vehicle called Forrest Gump, a movie which held\u000aback most others that year, and deservedly so.  As often happens, seemingly\u000ato avoid one particular film taking home all the gold, Oscars were awarded\u000ato other films over Forrest Gump that year in various categories, and it's\u000atoo bad that Shawshank wasn't one of them.I guarantee that you will love the characters of Andy & Red, along with the\u000ainteraction between them; hate Warden Norton and his sniveling sidekick\u000aCaptain Hadley; and be moved by the eloquent ending of this fantastic and\u000aunforgettable film.  It truly is an experience not to be missed. 10/10, and I'd give it an 11 if I could.\u000a

V\u000a\u000aThis film is up there with the classics!  Is a deeply moving story, which\u000aportrays friendship, trust, hope and corruption.  The ending is superb, and\u000abrings a smile to my face every single time i watch it.  It shows a very\u000arealistic view of prisons in the 1930's where the officers were almost, or\u000aeven more corrupt and evil than the inmates.  This is film which will never become outdated or even considered to be\u000a'coming of age'.  With superb acting from Morgan Freeman and Tim Robbins, it\u000ahas to be the best film I have seen in a long long time.\u000a

V\u000a\u000aSome of the comments on this forum have described this film in parts as\u000abeing unrealistic and simplified but to me this film represents a purity\u000aand\u000aa brilliance in film making that is very uncommon. What were those people\u000aat\u000athe Oscars thinking when they passed up Morgan Freeman for best actor? He\u000awas quite simply superb....his character is so believable, so warm and\u000acompassionate, if ever a convicted murderer displayed his traits of reason\u000aand forgiveness it'd be a crime to keep him behind the sterile, evil walls\u000aof somewhere like Shawshank. Robbins also plays his role in quiet\u000aperfection\u000aas the thoughtful city banker wrongly imprisoned for murder. I think the\u000aman\u000adeserves his comparisons with Orson Welles.....what an actor. We see both\u000abrutality and humanity in the prison guards and some lighter moments when\u000athey all begin to realise they can profit from Dufrane's financial wizardry\u000athough of course the forced and immoral contract with Dufrane in enriching\u000athe sadistic Capt. Hadley and Warden Norton always lurks in the\u000amind......the potential for violence and betrayal never far from our minds.\u000aIf US prisons were like this, I feel genuine pity for the inmates, no\u000amatter\u000awhat their crimes.I thought the imagery and cinematography, as well as the stirring\u000asoundtrack\u000ato be other remarkable features. From the Maine flag fluttering in the\u000abreeze as the camera sweeps over the prison....to the inmates listening to\u000athe Marriage of Figaro and finally to Red's walk through those sun drenched\u000afields in search of Andy Dufrane's promise under that great Oak tree. In\u000aone\u000aword, inspiring.The ability of this picture to move has been vividly described in many past\u000acomments and the script in itself is like some beautiful songbird that flew\u000ainto Hollywood and brought the the notion of quality to new levels. It's\u000anot\u000athat it is complicated, it is a simple story but that's where its genius\u000alies I believe, that's why most rank it amongst the greatest movies ever\u000amade. Robbins' descriptions of the Pacific beach he one day hopes to be on,\u000ahis heroic attempts to bring these wretched and brutalised prisoners a\u000ataste\u000aof freedom and normality actually carries them beyond those ideals and on\u000ato\u000aa higher plain almost. He gives them (if only for a short time) an inner\u000apeace which transports them beyond those prison walls. Though we never\u000aforget that the great majority of them are there because they committed\u000aviolent crime, the irony of it, as Robbins says himself, is that he had to\u000acome to prison to become a crook. This seems to be the case when men and\u000awomen are incarcerated for long periods. Robbins' hope is of course one of\u000athe major themes of the film and I found that you can, in a strange way,\u000atransport this to your own life, to your current problems and fears and\u000athat\u000ais the genius of films like this, it liberates the viewer as well, makes\u000ayou\u000athink.    \u000a

V\u000a\u000aI have to confess that I cried at the end of "Shawshank redemption" - I\u000acried for the first time since my grandmother died. Why was this?The movie is a flamboyant plea for hope in our lives. It shows us that it's\u000anever really over, and that you can redeem for you mistakes and find\u000ahappiness in your days.Of course the final passage might be a bit unrealistic. I just say: Poster.\u000aBut I really can't blame anybody for doing the story as they did it - it\u000aworks perfectly and this final passage somehow liberates the viewer after\u000anearly two hours of living in prison. The cinematography is simply splendid,\u000athe feeling of being incarcerated is very subtly generated and you only\u000arealize it when you finally "get out" of it. The pictures vary from\u000afrightening to simply beautiful, and the dialogue and the comments of Morgan\u000aFreeman from the Off are really a joy to listen to.But this is just a very rational analysis of a film that stirs very strong\u000aemotions. It is futile to try  to explain this phenomenon in these few\u000alines, and therefore I won't try to do so. I only can highly recommend this\u000amovie to everybody who is willing to get into a 2 1/2 hour prison movie\u000awhich in the end proves to be much more. 10 of 10 even it is a bit long in the middle. 10 of 10 because I somehow\u000afelt a bit liberated after it. \u000a

V\u000a\u000aThis is what movies are truly made for.  This is movie making as an art\u000aform.  This movie deeply conveys more human insight than I thought possible\u000ain something so short and simple as a film.  It deals with sin, love,\u000afriendship, fear, greed, persistence, frailty, hope, courage, cruelty and a\u000awhole array of other human traits, and it deals with all of them in an\u000aamazingly complex and full manner.  This is a prime example of a creation\u000athat allows us to understand another's soul.  It does this through words,\u000asounds, facial expressions, in short, everything that a movie can offer us\u000ain condensed form that we often don't pay attention to in life.  We have to\u000apay attention here.  We can't look away.  If you can come out of this movie\u000awithout finding something out about yourself you haven't really experienced\u000ait, perhaps you've just watched it.  I give very few movies a 10, because\u000anothing man made can ever really be perfect, but some things come close. \u000aThis is one.\u000a

V\u000a\u000aIt's as simple as that and 2 things stopped it from achieving that honour.\u000aThe enormous nostalgia eventual winner Forest Gump had most wrapped up in\u000aand more importantly the unappealing first impression this movie gave when\u000ait was released.The worst assumption one could make of The Shawshank Redemption is to\u000athink\u000ait's a depressing prison movie. Admittedly that's exactly what I thought\u000awhen I first saw the preview scene of Morgan Freeman telling Tim Robbins\u000athat "hope is a dangerous thing.." I remember thinking OK my life really\u000aisn't like being in prison, but do I wanna watch something that's gonna\u000abring the mood down a notch. Big mistake at the time, but just like the\u000atitle, I had my own redemption of sorts when I caught it on\u000avideo.The performances of Robbins & Freeman should have won the best &\u000asupporting\u000aactor oscars and the work of the rest of the cast makes you wish they had\u000aan\u000aensemble category. To late for "shoulds" I know, but in years to come if\u000athis title doesn't cement itself into the all time top 5 I'll be\u000asurprised.Knowing millions have now seen it would make it easy to reveal more of the\u000amovie to give it a better description for those who haven't, but that's\u000aexactly what would ruin it for them. As cliched as it sounds, the whole\u000aphrase of "just give it a chance and watch it" has probably never been\u000amore\u000aappropriate for a movie like this one.\u000a

The film, and the Stephen King novella it\u000aderives\u000afrom, are a treasure. Even if you're not a big reader, seek out Rita\u000aHayworth and the Shawshank Redemption. It's contained in a collection of 4\u000anovellas - one for each season. After you've seen the film, it should be\u000aapparent which season Shawshank is allocated. The book also has enough\u000adeviations, including a different ending, to keep you enthralled even if\u000ayou've seen the film several times.\u000a

V\u000a\u000aI've seen this movie about a half-dozen times now, and it's slowly occurred\u000ato me that this is one of my two or three very favorite films. Each time\u000aI've seen it, I can appreciate different things about it, and the depth of\u000athe dialogue, and the meaning behind the events and characters takes on\u000adifferent symbolism and significance.Having just read the story this was based on, I find it a rare example of\u000awhere the film is better than the book. Not that the book isn't good, but\u000athere are some significant changes in the film that helped to make it such\u000aan endearing piece of work, and a more powerful experience than the\u000aoriginal\u000ashort story was. The development of the characters of the warden, and\u000aBrooks, for example, really fleshes out the story well.The acting and direction is perfectly subtle and restrained, and though the\u000afeel may be a bit slow at times for some people, it gives a good sense of\u000athe feeling of time slowly dripping by in these people's lives.What a shame that this was nominated for so many Academy Awards, including\u000aBest Picture, Actor (Morgan Freeman), and adapted screenplay,\u000acinematography, music, etc., but didn't win anything. Granted, "Forrest\u000aGump" is a great film, too, but it would have been nice if "Shawshank" had\u000aat least won something. Oh, well, that's not really important in the big\u000apicture, I suppose. The fact that this film is ranked #2 of all time here\u000ais\u000avery telling, and I'm sure it will be appreciated for a very long time to\u000acome... I know that every time it comes on TNT, I have to watch it\u000aagain!\u000a

The main characters are quite\u000ahuman and engaging. I found myself almost projecting, mentally, into the\u000agroup as they share their day-to-day experiences in the joint.

V\u000a\u000aI have to give this film a 10. It is easily right up there with Dolores\u000aClaiborne, Rudy, and Contact. Like Dolores Claiborne, this film is a\u000adeparture for the usual story inspired by a Stephen King composition. The\u000amovie is quite faithful to the King novella which I also highly\u000arecommend.The acting alone is worth the price of admission. Tim Robbins terrificly\u000aunderplays his part. The whole cast contribute to make this more than\u000ajust a\u000amovie; if it hits you like I think it will, you will be forever marked by\u000ait.Sadly neither this film nor Pulp Fiction won the Best Picture Oscar in\u000a1994.\u000aIncredulously, Forrest Gump won this honor. There is no reasonable\u000aexplanation for this fiasco.Finally, should you decide to see it, rent it or see it on pay cable.\u000aLike\u000amost of the movies above, Ted Turner seems to have cornered the market on\u000ashowing them. If you do see it on TNT, there will be a lot of missing,\u000acrucial scenes and the commercials kind of ruin it; at least for me it\u000adoes.\u000a

V\u000a\u000aI've read a number of the other user comments on this movie, and I was\u000aglad\u000ato see that every one of them regarded the movie as one of the best\u000athey've\u000aever seen.  The fact that 100% of the reviews I saw all rated this movie\u000aas\u000asomewhere beyond excellent says it all.  I like all sorts of films, from\u000aserious to goofy comedies, but my list of the best films of the last 15 or\u000aso years includes the heavy hitters like Rain Man, Unforgiven, Jerry\u000aMaguire, Good Will Hunting, Murder In The First (because of Kevin Bacon's\u000aawe-inspiring performance) and Saving Private Ryan, which are all fabulous\u000amovies.  But Shawshank tops them all by a good margin.  It is, without a\u000adoubt, that good.I'm also an avid reader, one of those who thinks that the book almost\u000aalways\u000afar outshines the movie, no matter how good the movie.  And Shawshank is\u000aone\u000aof my favorite stories by my favorite author, but this movie takes the\u000astory\u000ato a completely new level.  I've never encountered another written or\u000afilmed\u000awork that better shows the 'triumph of the spirit' theme.There are a number of deeply moving scenes in the movie, but for me, the\u000aclimax of the movie, the point where everything comes together, is when\u000aMorgan Freeman's character is released from prison and contemplating\u000akilling\u000ahimself.  He finally comes to understand (or maybe just to accept)\u000asomething\u000athat Tim Robbins' character told him earlier, and he says, "Get busy\u000aliving... or get busy dying. That's goddamn right."  This line starts a\u000asequence that leads up to what, in my opinion, is the most perfect ending\u000aever filmed.Every aspect of this movie is of the highest caliber.  The script is\u000aexcellent, the acting of Morgan Freeman and Tim Robbins is incredible, the\u000amusical score is flawless, and the direction is obviously superb.  What's\u000aeven more incredible is that this was Frank Darabont's first feature\u000afilm -\u000aand he surely rose above to make this one.  Forrest Gump won the Oscars it\u000adid because of its sentimentality and the nostalgic look at American\u000ahistory.  It did NOT win because it was the best picture of that year.  I\u000ahad no problem with Tom Hanks winning the best actor award, but Shawshank\u000ashould have won every other award it was nominated for.  I though Forrest\u000aGump was excellent, but Shawshank was so much better that its getting beat\u000aout for best picture is on a par with Shakespeare In Love beating Saving\u000aPrivate Ryan.Well, I'll get off my soap box now.  I would have no problem going on with\u000ahow moving and beautifully-done this movie is, but I think you probably\u000aget\u000athe point by now.\u000a

V\u000a\u000aNot exactly a movie you would think to have Stephen King in the credits,\u000awhich gives the film a sense of irony. When watching the film, one\u000aexperiences many emotions, and though not enough to make most people cry,\u000aenough to leave you reeling. Our hero Andy (Tim Robbins)quite frankly goes\u000athrough a lot, but is steered toward the right direction because of his\u000aundying hope of getting out. Andy also leads fellow inmate Red (Morgan\u000aFreeman) "to the light", and teaches us all how important hope is to have\u000awithin us. I guess another good point is just how many films can you name\u000athat have happy endings, and aren't in any way at least slightly corny?\u000a\u000a

V\u000a\u000aShawshank Redemption is one of those few movies which can only be made\u000awhen\u000aall things come together. Narrative, Scenario pacing, cinematography,\u000aperformance and directing are only some of the main elements that make for\u000aa\u000agreat movie when all are in balance to serve the main purpose which is the\u000astorytelling. But sometimes GOD says let there be that moment when every\u000aother aspect, of the greatest art form in cinema history, swells the other\u000aup to make magic happen on and behind the white screen!There is no need to elaborate on Shawshank Redemption because those whom\u000ahave witnessed it knows it's power and grandeur in appearance.For those whom haven't crossed paths with Shawshank Redemption yet should\u000aby\u000aall means necesary make it a lifes effort to rent and buy this Movie.\u000aBefore\u000ayou leave this place you once knew as Mother Earth you need to have\u000aexperienced one of the greater feelings in cinema history!I hope I myself as a Filmmaker will come across a breathtaking story like\u000athis to film, there is simply no greater reward to a filmmaker than to\u000ahave\u000adirected a Movie like this.In closing I will add, for those running off to the store looking for\u000aShawshank Redemption, look up these next films for they will change your\u000alife for they have changed mine and made me become a filmmaker.It's a wonderful life (Frank Capra), Ben Hur (William Wyler), Ran (Akira\u000aKurosawa) and M (Fritz Lang).There are many other great movies but for starters just start with these\u000acause you'll be watching these a many a times.\u000a\u000a

V\u000a\u000aIt's tough to say anything about this movie that hasn't already been said.\u000aWe all know that it's an amazing film, full of great horror, humor, and\u000ahope, that Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman are fantastic, and that the\u000aending's one of the finest endings ever. There are just some notes I'd like\u000ato jot down. Have you ever noticed how easy it is to be ironic about difficult\u000asubjects? Have you ever noticed how being ironic about difficult subjects is\u000afrequently mistaken for edginess? Have you ever noticed how great and\u000aexceptional this movie is for *not* approaching its subject with irony? The plot to Shawshank isn't that amazing, but it's certainly nothing bad.\u000aNobody enjoys Shawshank for the plot. The feeling one gets at the end and\u000athe characters are what makes this movie so powerful. I've heard some people grumble about how having the main villain being a\u000aBible-thumper shines a bad light on people who frequently quote the Bible. I\u000awould argue that that's the case no more than Hannibal Lecter shines a bad\u000alight on intellectuals, and that if you quote the Bible in a fashion that\u000areminds them of the Warden then you are doing something gravely\u000awrong.\u000a

Despite\u000athe fact that I saw the movie is 1996 or 1997, I can still remember some of\u000athe poignant momments in the film and how the entire film made me feel\u000a(heartfelt and happy!).Overall, I think Shawshank was an absoloutely amazing film. It showcases\u000agreat performances from both Morgan Freeman and Tim Robbins, and also\u000ademonstrates the quality of writing that people should expect from somebody\u000alike Steven King.\u000a

V\u000a\u000aI came expecting a masterpiece and left with the impression I'd seen a\u000arelatively unremarkable film with pretensions of profundity. Put plainly,\u000athe primary message is "Hope sustains the human spirit in a world of\u000ahardship and despair," which is a truism that would fit nicely in a\u000afortune\u000acookie. Nonetheless, the power of hope can serve as an affecting theme.\u000aPerhaps this common theme is taken by so many as great depth because so\u000amuch\u000aof Hollywood's product these days is appallingly shallow or callously\u000abrutal. Apparently, the public is desperate for something to care\u000aabout.The direction is somewhat mannered and reminiscent of older films, which\u000ain\u000aitself is neither good nor bad. But in this case it blends with a\u000astoryline\u000athat seems virtually comprised of movie cliches of prison life. The\u000acharacters are also stereotypes: the evil warden (bible-toting,\u000anaturally!),\u000athe brutal and inhuman prison guard, the gang of prison buddies, the gang\u000aof\u000acell block victimizers, the experienced convict who has mastered the\u000asystem\u000a(played by Morgan Freeman), the enigmatic newcomer who works subtly to\u000asubvert the system (played by Tim Robbins) -- all the classics on parade,\u000awith few of the unnecessary peculiarities that define real human beings!\u000aWe've seen them all before, and in more realistic guise. These\u000aone-dimensional characters function with the monomania of gears in a\u000amachine, churning out a largely predictable plot. This is typical of\u000aallegorical stories, and I suspect this story can be read as allegory\u000a(which\u000ais not surprising, since it is based on a Stephen King tale). Regardless,\u000aI\u000acan honestly say not one element of the plot caught me by surprise.In all, the film seems to hover in tone and content somewhere between\u000areality and the idealized world of the fable (say, a fable like The Green\u000aMile, a movie by the same director). Many of the story elements seemed in\u000aone way or another contrived, which left me feeling vaguely dissatisfied\u000aand\u000amanipulated. Even good devices -- such as the well-known tendency of\u000aprisoners to become programmed by prison life, resulting in problems when\u000athey return to society (a syndrome referred to in the film as becoming\u000a"institutionalized") -- lose some of their power through a rather\u000aheavy-handed treatment. However, the climax of the story (although\u000apredictable) was very well-constructed and quite effective.Regarding the acting, Tim Robbins is fair, but hardly awe-inspiring. On\u000athe\u000aother hand, Morgan Freeman, one of my favorite actors, is a rare talent\u000awho\u000ais almost certain to turn in a superb performance. This movie is no\u000aexception, and I believe if viewers think about it, they will realize that\u000athe strongest, most eloquent and moving portion of the movie is the last\u000ahalf hour in which his character, Red, is the focus of attention. The\u000aextended denouement almost saved the film for me, but for this viewer the\u000amovie reached its end with only a hint of the title's promised\u000aredemption.For those of you who want to see a prison movie that is deeper, more\u000aprofound, has better dialogue, plotting, and symbolism; and presents\u000acharacters in now familiar roles (your assignment, compare and contrast!)\u000abut with considerably more substance and reality, check out Cool Hand\u000aLuke.\u000aIt may not spell out what it's all supposed to mean in Shawshank's\u000auser-friendly, large-print narration, but it is nonetheless in all\u000arespects\u000athe superior movie.\u000a\u000a

V\u000a\u000a"The Shawshank Redemption" is the best film from a Stephen King story.\u000aThe\u000abest by far.  This film fits together so intricately and the end seems\u000aalmost impossible.

"The Shawshank Redemption"\u000asits on another level.  It is a film that will not grow old.  It will stay\u000afresh and fulfilling as the years go by.  This is a must-see film.

But the interesting thing is\u000athat\u000aShawshank Redemption never won any thing at the 1994 Academy Awards, least\u000aof all Best Picture.\u000aLook at the competition... Forrest Gump, Quiz Show, Pulp Fiction, and (for\u000aHeaven's Sake) 4 Weddings and a Funeral!  If I do recall correctly, the\u000abuzz\u000aat that time was that the only *real* contenders were Pulp and Forrest.\u000aShawshank never figured in the race. FYI, Forrest won it, and he's at #169\u000ain the IMDb 250.Anyway, my opinion is that every once in a long while, you get ordinary\u000apeople who have had minimal success on their own, come together and make an\u000aalmost perfect movie. This is it. I doubt that anyone of the people who\u000amade\u000athis film will ever be able to reach the heights they did with Shawshank.\u000aSome have tried, but failed (like the director -> Green\u000aMile).Embrace this film, and let it enrich your being.\u000a\u000a

V\u000a\u000aThis is my favourite movie of all time. I saw it when it was first shown in\u000aGerman free-TV. I was gripped from the beginning because the story was told\u000ain the Stephen King-type epic slowness with always something happening.\u000aThen, about 100 minutes into the film, there was THE scene. Those who have\u000aseen the movie will know which one I mean. It was like a slap in the face\u000abut it didn't hurt. It was just inspiration. The feeling decreased very\u000aslowly because there were other, smaller slaps following. Since then, this\u000ahas been my favourite film and I haven't seen any better. I wasn't surprised\u000athat it was nominated for seven Oscars!But when I looked it up in the IMDb I was surprised that it's among the top\u000aten and so popular because I hadn't heard anything about it before. It was\u000anot successful at all in Europe. All the happier I was because I felt\u000aconfirmed in my enthusiasm. I mean, I have to admit that the main reason for\u000achoosing this as my favourite was the finesse of the most satisfying\u000apunchline` in movie history. I like characters who are unbreakable because\u000aof their mental power. Yes, it's definitely a movie about hope. But it would\u000abe unfair to forget about all the other elements:Morgan Freeman is one of the most mature actors in the world. He always\u000achooses roles with quality. And Tim Robbins is a very changeable actor: Just\u000athink about Cadillac Man` or Bull Durham` and the characters he played\u000athere. But also all the minor characters are described very precisely and\u000aintegrated in the plot. It's not just a couple of episodes: it's one huge,\u000amagnificent story.Roger Deakins, the favourite cinematographer of (my favourite directors)\u000aJoel & Ethan Coen helps to make it not just an epic, also a cinematic\u000amasterpiece. And Frank Darabont is a fascinating director because he\u000aconcentrates on the story and doesn't try to push himself to the fore by any\u000afacilities in directing, except THE scene I already mentioned. All of the\u000aseven Oscars should have been won by The Shawshank Redemption`. With all\u000adue respect for Forrest Gump`.\u000a\u000a

V\u000a\u000aI consider myself an avid movie-watcher with mostly mainstream choices for\u000amy favorite movies.  One of my favorite genres is inspirational movies\u000alike\u000aRudy, Contact, and October Sky.  Tops on my list of any genre is The\u000aShawshank Redemption.  One of the driving factors that it tops my list is\u000abecause, like everyone else, I watched the movie on video with absolutely\u000ano\u000aexpectations.  At the time I had not seen a review, trailer, commercial,\u000aor\u000aeven the cover of the video box for the movie.  My wife went to the video\u000astore for me to rent it only because I heard it got nominated for an\u000aAcademy\u000aAward for Best Picture.  We popped the movie in around 11:00 p.m.,\u000athinking\u000awe will fall asleep during the movie.  Well, two hours later, the only way\u000awe could describe the movie would be inspirational.  After the movie, I\u000astarted to notice the commercials, the posters, and the box cover all gave\u000areferences to the crucial twist at the end.  I think if I saw any of these\u000athings before I watched the movie then I would have put 2 and 2 together\u000aand\u000ait would have made the movie less enjoyable. Word of mouth is the reason\u000awhy\u000ait has been such a hit on video, and in the future will be the reason it\u000awill be considered on of the greatest movies of all time.\u000a

Every single shot in this\u000amovie was a good one, the camera worked wonders that the average eye\u000adisregards as they focus on the beauty of the film.  This is the story of a falsely convicted man, and his struggle for\u000afreedom.  Beyond the already great fact that it was a prison movie set in\u000athe 40's through late 60's, it was written by Stephen King, one of the\u000agreatest fictional writers of the late 20th centruy.  The best part about\u000aprison movies is the fact that it's always moving, always developing, never\u000aboring.  There's just something about prison movies that make you feel at\u000ahome, as odd as that sounds.  And plus, the movie was full of great\u000anarration and dialouge, full prison similes that were so eloquent, you know\u000aonly Stephen King could have written them.  Shawshank is the kind of movie\u000ayou could watch over and over again and never get sick of, like American\u000aBeauty or One Flew Over The Cuckoo's Nest.     The movie just simply is perfect by every standard that we set.  Do\u000ayourself a favor and see this movie.\u000a

V\u000a\u000aThis movie is spectacular.  It keeps you dangling on your seat, gets you\u000aleaping onto your feet, attracting, repelling, and always surprising. I was SO AMAZED.  I still am, you know.  At first, he was just one of the new guys, that "tall glass of water with a\u000asilver spoon up his @$$", a quiet, hotshot banker/wife killer.  Next, he was\u000aAndy, the sculptor, the friend, the goody-goody...or was he?  Red wasn't\u000asure, the audience wasn't sure.  Red thought he knew Andy, and so did we,\u000adespite (or because) of the suspenseful movie trailers and reviews. Thought.If you haven't seen it, then may God rest your soul.  Meanwhile, do yourself\u000aa favour and go see it.  Rent it, borrow it, watch it with friends, by\u000ayourself, whatever...and believe me: you'll feel a WHOLE LOT\u000aBETTER.\u000a

V\u000a\u000aIt's unbelievable -- I'm dumbfounded.  As of this writing, Shawshank\u000aRedemption is #2 in the top 250 films in the IMDB (I'm sure "The Godfather"\u000astill holds the #1 spot).  That is simply incredible for a film released\u000aseven years ago, absolutely mindblowing.  This movie captured more than just\u000aa generation, it captured the hearts and minds of the global moviegoing\u000apublic, and apparently will not let go.Think of the hundreds of films released since 1994... and realize that\u000a"Shawshank Redemption" holds the #2 spot... on the world's most popular film\u000asite -- truly the worldwide *people's* democratic vote!If you still haven't seen it, you owe it to yourself.  With perhaps the most\u000acathartic, satisfying ending in film history, superb, sharply-defined\u000acharacters and plot, plot, plot... this is the film to see if you love\u000amovies, and even if you hate movies.  If you see only one movie in your\u000alifetime, this may be the one to see (you can read 'The Godfather', which in\u000amy opinion is much better in book format).A work of art that is not going to go away, "Shawshank Redemption" is the\u000abest prison movie ever released and one of the greatest films of all\u000atime.\u000a

V\u000a\u000aI am neither a Stephen King nor a prison movie fan, so had not bothered to\u000awatch this film until recently... That was my loss. Shawshank Redemption, like all great movies, falls into no category. It\u000adefines its own space. It is an incredible story woven across time and\u000abetween two characters. It is about Spirit and Justice. And\u000afriendship.Morgan Freeman and Tim Robbins should have shared Best Actor Oscars for this\u000afilm. I hate to admit it, but Stephen King has talent.\u000a

V\u000a\u000aIn people's descriptions of films, the terms "best", "favorite", "great",\u000a"a\u000aclassic" and the like often get bandied about with no real meaning. I've\u000aheard someone describing ten different movies, and refer to all ten as the\u000abest movies he'd ever seen, all within the span of five\u000aminutes.But with The Shawshank Redemption, those words most definately have\u000ameaning.\u000aThis movie is, quite simply, the single most masterful film I have ever\u000aseen. It is completely and utterly amazing, and I have never seen a movie\u000athat has surpassed it. Others have come close, but none can match the\u000asheer\u000apower of The Shawshank Redemption. Words simply don't do justice to the\u000aemotions I feel each time I watch this film, and I am left in awe of how\u000aprofound it is.To anyone who has not seen this flawless gem, you are missing out on the\u000asingle greatest film ever made. Film is Art, and The Shawshank Redemption\u000ais\u000athe film equivalent of a DaVinci, a Michaelangelo, or a Rembrant. It is\u000asimply amazing.\u000a

V\u000a\u000aLast night i saw this movie for the second time and i enjoyed it as much as\u000athe first, it is definetely one of my favorites.Andy Dufresne (Tim Robbins) is wrongly accused for the murder of his wife\u000aand her lover, and sentenced to 2 life-time penalties in jail. After some\u000adifficult years, he gets used with his inmate life, but doesn't give up the\u000ahope of being free again. All this with the help of his best friend, Red\u000a(Morgan Freeman).The movie is brilliantly directed, brilliantly written and brilliantly\u000aplayed. Darabont makes a great debut as director with a movie of a quality\u000athat he probably will not be able to equal in the rest of his career. And\u000awhen you think that the writing credits belong to the master of horror\u000ahimself, Stephen King, you definetely can be only surprised. Stephen managed\u000ato write something else than his fabulous horrors. A touching sensitive\u000adrama about friendship, honesty, injustice, and more than everything else,\u000aabout hope.Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman are both great in their roles. They manage to\u000abring a certain depth to their characters, and these aren't easy roles at\u000aall. But they come to the end with success and they deserve all the praises\u000ain the world for their performances.All in all this movie is a must for all the movie fans out there. If you\u000aconsider yourself a movie lover than missing this one would be a crime. A\u000acrime you'd be fairly accused of. Vote: almost 10, out of 10.\u000a

V\u000a\u000aThe Shawshank Redemption is the type of film which has divided its audience\u000ainto two categories: those who loved it, and those who don't care for it. \u000aThere is rarely anything between.  Flawless acting, passionate direction,\u000aand a memorable score have made the film a powerful cinematic experience,\u000aand at times, it can be thought provoking.  It never lacks in pace, there is\u000aalways a steady rhythm to the film.  The Shawshank Redemption is a modern\u000amasterpiece.Rating: 10\u000a

V\u000a\u000aI have seen this movie like a thousand times, and I enjoyed it every\u000asingle\u000atime, because every single time watching it, I remarked new anecdotes that\u000aI\u000ahadn't in the previous watching. Morgan Freeman is definitely on his best\u000aperformance ever,(I just love the part where he sits in front of the\u000arehabilitation committee for the last time and tells them how it feels to\u000abe\u000ain prison for more than 20 years), and Frank Darabont can surely be proud\u000aof\u000adirecting an intelligent movie, but Tim Robbins deserves to be mentioned\u000adue\u000ato an excellent performance as well as all the other actors. I appreciate\u000athe way in which this movie combines two crucial topics of every life:\u000aHope\u000aand disillusion ! And I guess I also liked it because there aren't any\u000awomen\u000ain the movie! No offence! \u000a

Actually, I have noticed the film\u000afor a long time in video&audio shops in my city. But maybe the cover and\u000athe\u000atranslation of the movie's name are not attractive, it didn't catch my\u000aattention.\u000aI saw it in a cold winter afternoon. And when the film ended, I thanked\u000aGOD\u000afor taking me such a good film to me.

V\u000a\u000aI think most of what I think about this movie has already been said in a\u000anumber of positive and negative reviews already available for reference.  It\u000acertainly is what I would classify as a great movie, but since I haven't\u000aseen as many films as I would like, I'm not sure whether it would be\u000aappropriate for me to call it a "best of all time".You know when you see the end of a movie and it leaves you so shocked it\u000atakes your breath away(think "Sixth Sense")?  Let me put it this way:  have\u000athe Resolve carpet cleaner handy, for you will be dropping drinks throughout\u000athe movie.  It surprises you at every turn.I'm not a movie reviewer, and all I know is how I reacted to seeing it the\u000afirst few times.  My family couldn't watch it with me, as my constant "Oh my\u000aGod!"'s annoyed them.Just take my work for it and see it.  It can't hurt you.\u000a

V\u000a\u000aThis movie is so far the best American film I have ever seen. I am\u000asurprised\u000ait didn't receive the Academy Award for Best Picture and Best Director.\u000aThe\u000astory is touching and the actors delivered excellent performance. It\u000acaptured the subtle human emotions one expressed when he faced a sudden\u000atraumatic misfortune in life and demonstrated how he kept hope and faith\u000awhen he spent years of difficult life in prison. It also has a good\u000aportrait\u000aof true friendship between the two main characters in the movie (Tim\u000aRobins\u000aand Morgan Freeman). I am sure I will own a DVD for this film and will\u000awatch\u000ait again and again over the years as every time I watched it, it reminded\u000ame\u000aof the courage, hope and faith one should have when faced with obstacles\u000ain\u000alife.\u000aI can't say enough good thing about this film.

V\u000a\u000a  "The Shawshank Redemption" is without a doubt one of the best films of the\u000a90's and one of the best prison dramas of all time.   "The Shawshank Redemption" can go head to head with any great movie of the\u000a90's and probably win. The plot is airtight with only one or two mistakes\u000athrough the whole film, not a lot of films could say the with even the likes\u000aof Forrest Gump, Titanic and Unforgiven have mistakes in them. One thing\u000athat Darabont does better than any director i've seen in a long time is pace\u000aevery scene perfectly.  Another great thing about this film is the pitch perfect cast. Tim Robbins\u000aputs in the best performance of his career, even topping his role in "The\u000aPlayer" and Morgan Freeman is outstanding as "Red" Redding and old tymer who\u000aknows everything and has seen everything about jail. Bob Gunton is also\u000abrilliant as the evil sheriff putting in his best performance. But the most\u000aunderrated performance in my opinion is the one put in by James Whitmore as\u000a"Brooks".  Eventhough "The Shawshank Redemption" may seem like a tear jerker or like\u000aa tragic drama by the end you will have a smile on your face . I won't ruin\u000ait for you but the ending is one of the best I have ever seen, only rivaled\u000aby the unexpected twist in "The Usual Suspects". So if you want to feel some\u000aemotion, be surprised and enlightened or just plainly watch a great movie\u000arent "The Shawshank Redemption".\u000a10/10 Near Perfect Movie \u000a\u000a

V\u000a\u000aThe Shawshank Redemption is one of the wisest and most touching films I\u000ahave\u000aever seen.  It tells the tale of the friendship between two convicted\u000amurderers: Andy Dufresne (Tim Robbins) and "Red" Redding (Morgan Freeman).\u000aMany things make this a good film: its genuine depiction of prison life,\u000athe\u000awonderful performances from Robbins and Freeman, the great music from\u000aThomas\u000aNewman.  For all of these qualities, The Shawshank Redemption is worth\u000aseeing.What makes the film great for me, though, is the way that in its depiction\u000aof prison life, the film becomes an existential display of how most of us\u000alive our own lives.  ***SPOILER AHEAD***  Throughout the film, we are\u000aconfronted by how people choose to accept their freedom.  Brooks, the old\u000alibrarian, who has been in prison for almost his entire life, becomes\u000ascared\u000aof the freedom he enjoys, and can not take it.  The same fate almost\u000abefalls\u000aRed, but his redemption comes as he is able to accept the unpredictability\u000aof his life, and draw inspiration from Andy.  The film rings absolutely\u000atrue, I know many people who are too afraid to chase after their own\u000adreams,\u000aand would rather stay in a mundane yet predictable and secure job.  "Prison\u000alife consists of routine, and then more routine," Red says in the course of\u000athe film.  So, I imagine, do many people's lives.  The Shawshank Redemption\u000ais about breaking away from the routine, taking risks, and going after your\u000adreams without compromise.  \u000a

V\u000a\u000aThe Shawshank Redemption affords us the opportunity to experience the\u000aunique\u000amagic of hope, ironically, found in a setting not conducive of such hope:\u000aa\u000aprison.Simply put, this transcendent film explores the human condition ranging\u000afrom\u000ablinding rage and sinister avarice to hopeful realism and utter\u000adisenchantment.Played by a selection of actors supplying a wealth of talent to the film,\u000athe supporting characters, though differing on the surface, share the one\u000atrait of disillusionment, either through glib, passive resignation or\u000afiery,\u000aactive disgust.But the principal character, Andy Dufresne (Tim Robbins), does not share\u000athis disenchantment, at least not totally. He clings to hope and basic\u000atranscendental principles while facing adversity after adversity. Though\u000aeven Andy becomes shaken from time to time as he is pummeled by the events\u000aof life, either induced by the nefarious calculation or hopeless despair\u000aof\u000aothers, he continues with the battle.Andy is the consummate individual, disallowing what others say to him,\u000ainvalidating what others do to him, and ultimately defying what would\u000aappear\u000ato be reality itself in what seems to be a simple effort, primarily, to\u000abetter his life and, secondarily, to shine the light of hope into the\u000alives\u000aof those around him. Indeed, though it would seem that the fates\u000aoccasionally step in and lend Andy a hand, the awe-inspiring potential for\u000ahope must have been intrinsic and innate. And the fact remains that those\u000asame fates damned him in the first place. But perhaps, it was all part of\u000athe journey...Well, enough of my thoughts! See for yourself--I easily rate this film as\u000aa\u000aten. :-)\u000a\u000a

V\u000a\u000aShawshank is a story about a man who is wrongly convicted for the murder\u000aof\u000ahis wife and her lover.  He finds himself in the pits of hell or what is\u000acommonly known as Shawshank Prison.  There he learns about the power of\u000atruth and friendship as he changes the hearts of those he knows and lives\u000awith.  This story is not about the problems of our justice or prison\u000asystems\u000aand the horrors that prisoners face, not only from their fellow inmates\u000abut\u000aalso from those there to "manage" them; rather this story relays the close\u000abond that people form in tough situations and how our will to survive is\u000anot\u000ajust about whether or not we live but how we live.  To quote William\u000aWallace\u000afrom Braveheart, "every man dies not every man lives."  This is the story\u000aabout choosing to live and live with dignity and friendship in the face of\u000aall hardships.  Highly Recommended\u000a

V\u000a\u000aMany, many people jock this movie, calling it an intelligent, philosophical\u000aand moving epic, but It's really not all that. It is a good movie, but it is\u000anot great or thought provoking at all. That year, 1994, was a great year for\u000amovies considering Pulp Fiction, Ed Wood and Quiz Show among others, yet\u000apeople think Forrest Gump and Shawshank Redemption are great' movies? Gag\u000ame.Here's some of the problems (Don't read this if you haven't seen the\u000amovie)Morgan Freeman's character - Don't get me wrong Freeman is a great actor\u000a(even if he always plays the same part) but seriously, did you ever watch\u000aMTV's Scared Straight' or listened to Chris Rock's stand-up? Now tell me\u000awhat kind of 18-year-old murderer goes to prison and kicks around using\u000awords that would make Edgar Allen Poe go get his copy of Webster's?\u000aFreeman's character's narration also served as a purpose to constantly\u000abludgeon the viewer with 2nd rate philosophy people who've never been to\u000aprison come up with. By the end I was literally exhausted from the constant\u000astream of corny insight I've already heard. Tell the truth now... If you saw\u000aa murderer on the evening news you'd probably want him dead or at least in\u000aprison for life, yet here you're supposed to rejoice in his parole as a\u000aresult of a tired, bitch-em-out-I-don't-care speech that only seems to come\u000aup in movies. Another detraction to the narration is Morgan Freeman dropping\u000athe F, it never sounds right.The Warden - How many absolutely despicable characters has that guy played?\u000aHas anyone that evil ever run a prison? That is classic jail movie material.\u000aObviously the filmmakers realize people will be upset about glorifying\u000acriminals so the answer is to make the authority pure evil. How irritating\u000aIf you want to convey criminals, just show them having fun and being real\u000apeople; don't try to cover it up with evil police, try Bonnie and Clyde or\u000aPulp Fiction, much more interesting.Brooks  Some serious button pushing here. Brooks is a typical, lame attempt\u000ato draw out some sentiment. The bird thing is a rip off of Escape from\u000aAlcatraz and like Freeman's character he's a great guy who happened to\u000acommit an offense so despicable he's in one of the most secure prisons in\u000athe country, but we can forget about that, right? The `Brooks was here'\u000ahanging himself because he can't keep up is another Hollywood favorite. Who\u000ahangs themselves? My gosh, at Nuremberg guys took poison to avoid being\u000ahanged because of the shame and disrespect. Yet, Brooks hung himself when at\u000ahis age he could have waited a week and let nature take its course. Or\u000abetter yet if Brooks got an old-fashioned whore and binged himself to death\u000aon alcohol and mind-altering drugs. Almost sounds like fun, who would prefer\u000ahanging? You know who, a character in a movie. That pretty much sums up the\u000aShawshank Redemption, for what its aiming for it misfires because there is\u000anothing genuine or authentic about it.\u000a

Don't get me wrong, 'Gump' is a good film, but in my humble opinion\u000athe\u000aonly film that can come close to this is 'the Godfather'. The ending to\u000athe\u000afilm is just incredible, one of the few times that I have ever almost\u000acried\u000aduring a film.\u000aI won't give anymore away about the film.

V\u000a\u000aEvery so often, I feel cinematic achievement reaches a new zenith...a\u000apoint\u000awhere I feel (albeit erroneously) that the bar of accomplishment can rise\u000ano\u000amore. Yet, as said, I am eventually mistaken, mainly due to remarkable\u000astories of profound creative intensity. These are the creations that\u000ahighlight vital essences of life and society.The Shawshank Redemption is truly an element of such a category.The Stephen King novella, Rita Hayworth and the Shawshank Redemption, is a\u000arelatively brief tale, a section of a larger book called 4 Seasons. Still,\u000ait is brilliantly adapted as a feature-length motion picture, with no\u000aflaws\u000aor injustices therein.If you are wondering why it is such a good movie, then you only need to\u000athink about one word: freedom. Think about what it means, and how easy may\u000abe to take for granted in today's liberated world. Set in the hardened\u000aAmerican past, The Shawshank Redemption teaches us a valuable lesson about\u000athe fickle nature of sovereignty, and the inevitable boundaries that\u000arestrict us along the path of life. Still, despite the misery of\u000aindeterminate and forceful detainment, a love of life is found.As such, this film presents a quest like no other. The characters seek to\u000atranscend their enslavement in a vile microcosm of dubious honesty and ill\u000awill, cherishing the subtle scents of freedom that waft through the senses\u000aon a very limited basis. After seeing this film, you'll never look at a\u000abottle of beer or an opera record the same way: when you have nothing\u000aelse,\u000asuch frivolities are your only ties to freedom. Still, the intelligent\u000asocial analysis does not end at this basic level. Rather, it continues by\u000ashowing the affects of being reintroduced to reality, and the ensuing\u000aoverdose of true liberty...Nevertheless, as clear-cut as the overall theme may seem, a mark of\u000acunning\u000asnakes through it...fervent...unexpected...The result will knock you out of your seat. See for yourself.\u000a10/10\u000a\u000a

V\u000a\u000aSPOILER ALERT\u000aThis movie--as I just watched it for, say, the 100th time this morning--is\u000ajust incredible.  It gives me shudders everytime I watch it.  My favorite\u000apart is when the jerk realizes how tim robbins gets out.  What mastery!  I\u000athen felt true shudders when he scrambles out of the sewage pipe and rips\u000aoff his shirt.  I can only imagine being thrown in jail, innocently,\u000aspending years there, and not only to be set free but get back at the\u000ajerk,\u000aand have money at the end.  The movie is thought-provoking and intense\u000afrom\u000abeginning to end.  I love Morgan Freeman too.  The movie taught me many\u000alessons, and reminded me that the simple flight of a bird and the blue of\u000aan\u000aocean is something not to take for granted.  Freedom is definitely my\u000abiggest priority.\u000a

V\u000a\u000aThe Shawshank Redemption is one of those films which will stick with you for\u000athe rest of your life. You'll always remember it, think of it fondly, and\u000asmile when you think of the best parts of the film. Many films come and go\u000ain your memory (will you honestly look back at a film like Armageddon and\u000athink of it in the same light? I hope not), but this is one which has become\u000agreat, and will become greater with time.Everyone knows the story, so I will save time relating that to you, but I\u000awill say that the story has many levels to it, which are not as obvious to\u000asome viewers. The multitude of characters which the story gives us all have\u000ameaning and consequences to the two central characters, Andy and Red. (Think\u000aabout the references to/theme of birds). All the characters are a pleasure\u000ato watch, and come to life by the actors. However, the actors inhabit their\u000aroles so well, its hard to see them in different roles now.Tim Robbins was unfortunate not to be nominated for any other award than the\u000ascreen actors guild award, because he brought such weight and balance to the\u000afilm, where Morgan Freeman had the slightly more showy role, bringing\u000adignity and honesty to it. I think any nomination or award for either of the\u000aactors should have been shared.Frank Darabont is a talented director who has a good eye for what looks good\u000aon screen, has a way with his actors to produce the best out of them,\u000aunderstands how to tell a good story, and is likely to produce fine pieces\u000aof work in the future.I have always loved this film, and the story is just one which warms the\u000aheart and blood just thinking about it.\u000a

V\u000a\u000aI actually watched last year's 'The Green Mile' before I got round to\u000aseeing\u000athis.  And in many respects I'm glad.  This film is better constructed,\u000ahas\u000aa far more powerful script, and, most tellingly, a far more belivable\u000astory\u000a(the Green Mile dabbles in the supernatural and improbable).  What makes\u000athis movie so good is that it really deals with the psyche and emotions of\u000ahumanity, and isn't scared to go into detail with these emotions, even if\u000ait\u000ameans that the plot is sidetracked for a few minutes.  The male bonding\u000athroughout the film is touching, and (although sentimental) completely\u000abelievable.  The twist, although not quite as surprising as the 'Usual\u000aSuspects', adds a little bit extra to a plot that before was pretty much\u000aat\u000athe mercy of Morgan Freeman's narrative, which, while well delivered, all\u000agets a bit similar after a while.\u000aI think the biggest achievement here is, apart from the bread and\u000abutter\u000astuff like 'solid acting', 'sensitive direction', and 'breathtaking\u000aphotography', is just how well the movie shows its time scale.  The story\u000ais\u000abased over 20 years, charting the 'prison career' of an innocent\u000aman,\u000aand apart from the greying of Freeman's hair, it also features a lot of\u000anostalgic conversations.  Two tragedies among the group of friends that we\u000awatch also give a sense of perspective.  At the centre though, are\u000aFreeman's\u000abrief meetings with the prison board, asking for a release every ten\u000ayears.\u000aAs he delivers the most moving part of the film- his third speech to this\u000aboard, I guarantee you will be weeping buckets.  The first movie I ever\u000awatched that meant so well as to be 'beyond criticism' was 'Schindler's\u000aList'. This is the second. \u000a

V\u000a\u000aAfter seeing this movie again there isn't any words that I can think of to\u000aadequately describe what a truly great movie the Shawshank Redemption\u000arepresents.  Every human emotion was perfectly portrayed right down to the\u000acoldness of the Shawshank's concrete and steel.  This is Morgan Freeman's\u000abest movie to date and likely Tim Robbins best movie ever.  The cast's\u000aacting job is top notch.  The period and setting, perfect. Thomas Newman's\u000amusic score, perfect.  Supporting cast, perfect.  I think that this is the\u000aonly movie that I can not think of one single thing that would improve it.\u000aNothing.

V\u000a\u000aTo partially repeat myself, "The Shawshank Redemption" is not the greatest\u000afilm of all time.  On the other hand, it isn't standard-brand Hollywood\u000aproduct either.  Instead, like "Casablanca", "Shawshank" is Hollywood\u000aproduct raised to extraordinary levels through the mutual effort of\u000acraftspeople operating at peak levels.  The acting, direction, camera work,\u000aediting, set design, and music all contribute, but none of these carry the\u000afilm alone.  The script, however, is the one indispensable element that the\u000aothers rest upon, and it is the script upon which I want to concentrate. \u000aNot the plot, mind you--if you don't know already, it's a prison drama in\u000awhich many terrible and wonderful things happen.  Such stories can be told\u000ain many ways, but I especially admired the ways director/scripter Frank\u000aDarabont chose to convey Stephen King's original story.Examples include patterns set up early in the film, such as the pro forma\u000aspeech "Red" (Morgan Freeman) gives each time he faces the parole board, or\u000aapparent throwaway details that come to unexpected life as the plot\u000athickens.  The pacing is excellent, keeping viewers interested over the\u000afilm's length (well over 23 hours) by punctuating the story's progress not\u000aonly with the incidents of brutal violence one expects from a prison film,\u000abut also moments of unexpected grace.Finally, it's interesting to note that in the year "Pulp Fiction" received\u000aso much hoo-rah over the ways writer/director Quentin Tarantino played with\u000athe movie's internal time, Darabont got little credit for doing some of the\u000asame things in "Shawshank", such as depicting the same sequence of events\u000afrom different viewpoints when approaching the film's climax.  (Not that\u000a"Pulp Fiction" is less than brilliant, but "Shawshank"'s approach to its own\u000ainternal time was equally artful, if less flashy.)The only things I could fault this film for are being manipulative, as well\u000aas more than a little predictable in the last 15 minutes or so.  However,\u000athe previous 2 hours are so compelling, and set up so much emotional\u000amomentum, that it would take a titanic (if not "Titanic") sized object to\u000adrag the film down.There's a great deal more to be said about the ways everyone\u000ainvolved--actors, set designers, musicians, etc.--does their part to bring\u000a"Shawshank" to life, but someone else will have to say it.  Discover this\u000atreasure for yourself.\u000a

V\u000a\u000aThis is without a doubt one of  my 5 favorite movies. Even now, a month\u000aafter I\u000afirst saw it I still think about it and repeat its maxim "Hope is a good\u000athing."\u000aWhat can I say but that this is the beautiful made movie I have ever seen.\u000aThis movie is the most uplifting movie I have ever seen and also one of\u000athe\u000asmartest in its ending.\u000aI had before seen the posters for the movie and thought that this was\u000agoing\u000ato be another dumb movie but then TNT did me a favor and aired it on its\u000a"New Classics" program. Plus, IMBD and several articles exposed me to the\u000anewly found popularity of the movie and I was hooked. As I watched the\u000amovie, I knew that this would be one my new personal classics. Its moral,\u000athat hope is a good thing and its saying "get busy living or get busy\u000adying,\u000astil intrigue me.\u000aThe movie is amazing in its beauty. No one could have played Andy better\u000athan Robbins and Morgan Freeman was superb in his portrayel of a great\u000acharacter.\u000aWhat can I say but that by the end of the movie you feel good inside. You\u000afeel hope, just what the character feels. The movie makes you feel what\u000athe\u000acharacter feels and that is one of its best qualities.See the movie and be changed. It is definitely one of the best.\u000a\u000a

For a long time I thought Pulp Fiction was the best of\u000athe two, but as time goes by I've learned Shawshank is the better.This is a film that will be remembered and loved for all-time. It doesn't\u000amatter if you see this movie today, next week or in 10 years time from now.\u000aIt will always have this effect on people it has right now. It took a while\u000afor audiences to really appreciate this film, because they didn't understand\u000athat "hope is a good thing", but knew that "life was like a box of\u000achocolates and didn't know what we're going to get" later that year."Hype is a bad thing, maybe the worst of things"The only bad thing I can think about is the dutch translation for the novel\u000aby Stephen King which is "De Ontsnapping" and I'm NOT going to translate it\u000afor all those who haven't seen it yet, cause it gives away the final twist.I hope more and more people will love this film.

V\u000a\u000aThe Shawshank Redemption is the greatest film ever made.  It is one of\u000athose\u000afew films where I wouldn't touch a frame, given the chance.  It is\u000aabsolutely flawless, as well as the most inspiring film ever\u000amade.Steven King's novel is great, but what really gave life to this film is\u000aFrank Darabont's incredible direction.  It becomes more hypnotic every time\u000aI see it.  There is a point to every shot and angle, as well as everything\u000athat is said and done in the story.  Everything is necessary to entertain\u000aor\u000ato inspire.Citizen Kane may also be perfection, but it can't inspire the viewer and\u000ahelp them to connect with the characters.  Citizen Kane is a great film, a\u000atop ten film, but it's nowhere close to this.I recommend several viewings to anyone who has never seen The Shawshank\u000aRedemption.

V\u000a\u000aI consider this film superior to Forrest Gump (the big oscar winner that\u000ayear) in almost every way possible. Granted, Forrest Gump is a good film,\u000abut\u000aThe Shawshank Redemption is an absolutely brilliant piece of art (yes I\u000asaid\u000aart) that, in my opinion, is one of the greatest films ever made. Judging\u000afrom the scores it got here on the IMDB, many people agreed with\u000ame.This just prooves how ego-centric the Oscars actually are. They really\u000aaren't about which film is the best, they're about what the simple-minded\u000aaudience wants to win. Forrest Gump made an absolute killing at the box\u000aoffice, Shawshank did quite poorly. It's likely that the results at the\u000aOscars satisfied more people than it would have had Shawshank won, but\u000athat's only because not many people saw it. I'd like to see you find\u000asomeone\u000awho hasn't seen Forrest Gump.If you think this is a one time thing for the Oscars, look at the results\u000afor Titanic, a film that I thought was absolute trash, James Cameron's\u000aworst. It won a bunch of oscars because everyone on the planet saw it. LA\u000aConfidential was the FAR more deserving film of that year, Good Will\u000aHunting\u000awas also very good. But since the academy wouldn't want to upset all the\u000aidiotic fans of Titanic, it takes the oscars over the deserving film. The\u000aonly "NOMINATION" that lousy movie deserved was for visual effects and I\u000athought Starship Troopers deserved the win (which it didn't get, of\u000acourse).I think it's really sad that our society has become so corrupted by mass\u000ahysteria that it can't even figure out which films are great, and which\u000aaren't. Forrest Gump is good, The Shawshank Redemption is great. Titanic\u000ais\u000acrap, LA Confidential is very good (not as good as Shawshank\u000athough).\u000a

That\u000ais, I thought it would be heavy-handed, pretentious, self-consciously\u000ahigh-minded, and boring. It is anything but these. It's an engrossing story\u000aand very entertaining story of two men and how they overcome their past\u000alives. Freeman and Robbins give wonderful performances, and the supporting\u000acast measures up. There are plenty of funny moments in the film, and the\u000aending is intensely satisfying.

V\u000a\u000aIt's fun to watch this movie a second time and pick up some things you never\u000anoticed the first time. So many things simply went unnoticed (Andy writing\u000ainto the wall, his little geology tool, the "sex symbols throughout the\u000adecades" posters) and suddenly wind together to grab our attention and make\u000athis a wonderful movie. The film was fascinating in the fact that it showed\u000aus how "lifers" could only witness the change of culture in the outside\u000aworld by observing the prisoners that come and go over the years, and this\u000abeing the only glimpse on how the world is changing, they become\u000ainstitutionalized, and actually fear their freedom. I actually found myself\u000afeeling sorry for murderers, and I debated with myself on whether or not\u000athey should be released if they truly become rehabilitated. The\u000adetermination and hope transpired by Andy brought our hopes up: Most movies\u000abring our hopes up only to bring them down, but when we see him running\u000athrough the pond and standing in the rain with his arms raised and the great\u000amusic accompanying the scene, our hopes our fulfilled. This is one of only\u000aabout three or four films that had great smarts and left me completely\u000asatisfied. 10/10. \u000a

V\u000a\u000aThe most inspire movie about human determination. The almost similar plot to\u000a"The Green Mile" which i've seen before this one. What i can say the story\u000ais showing on how human should go on with their life no matter what happen\u000aand the needs of taking necessary action if possible.The character, Andy (which the same name with me, of course) has determine\u000ato take his wife life after knowing her of committing adultery. He has no\u000achoice but to take her life after afraid that she might gain most of his\u000amoney (since he was a successful banker). As the result of his action, he\u000awas sent to the maximun security prison where he befriend a famous\u000a"Smuggler" man nickname "Red" played by Morgan Freeman.Life goes on. Actually some of the characters from the movie i've seen them\u000ain "The Green Mile" and the story, as mentioned before, close to the one in\u000a"The Green Mile" scene such as the classic movie that they watch,\u000aetc.I've seen lots of Stephen King's movie adaptation but these two "The Green\u000aMile" and "The Shawshank Redemption" can be considered as one of the best\u000adrama movie i've ever seen.\u000a

V\u000a\u000aOn the surface level, the subject is run-of-the-mill, i.e. the torture meted\u000aout to some prison inmates. But it is the way this subject is handled,\u000athat's what makes this movie so unique and memorable. Andy Dufresne is the\u000avery heart and soul of the movie. It is the greatness, the uniqueness of his\u000acharacter that sets him apart from the other inmates, not to mention the\u000afact that he is wrongly convicted. Tim Robbins is absolutely brilliant in\u000ahis role. I believe this is what is supposed to mean an Academy Award\u000awinning performance. I have only seen him in another movie , 'Jacob's\u000aLadder', which is one of the most bleak movies I have ever seen. 'Shawshank'\u000ahas its bleak moments, scenes of violence and torture, but what saves them\u000afrom being a little too much for viewing is the narration by Morgan\u000aFreeman's character. Two scenes, one in which Andy gets beat by some other\u000aprison inmates and the one which Tommy(Gil Bellows) is shot are, I think the\u000amost violent in the movie. But the violence is kept under control by Red's\u000aensuing narration. It is that which also gives the movie an aura that this\u000ais the story of one man who, with his friendship with Andy, realizes that he\u000astill has life beyond the four walls of the prison and being a convict\u000adoesn't mean that he is bereft of human dignity. Morgan Freeman, as always,\u000ais perfect in his role. This is perhaps the best movie of Freeman's (except\u000amaybe 'Driving Miss Daisy'). The supporting cast is equally good, especially\u000aGil Bellows, who gives a short but poignant performance. Good\u000acinematography(sweeping images) and a good music score(especially the\u000aconcerto Andy broadcasts across the entire prison) are some of the magical\u000amoments of the movie and what adds to its greatness. Worth every moment!  \u000a

V\u000a\u000aI can honestly say that Frank Darabont's "The Shawshank Redemption" is my\u000afavourite film of all time.  It is simply perfect and it is criminal in my\u000aopinion that it missed out on so many Academy Awards in 1994. Inspired direction from Mr. Darabont is complimented by superb performances\u000afrom every member of the cast, which includes Tim Robbins, Morgan Freeman,\u000aBob Gunton, William Sadler and the menacing Clancy Brown.Based upon a Stephen King novel, "The Shawshank Redemption" is the story of\u000abanker Andy DuFresne, imprisoned for the alleged murder of his wife and her\u000alover.  As life in prison begins to take it's toll, DuFresne (Robbins)\u000abefriends prison "fixer" Red (Freeman) who is understood to be 'a man who\u000aknows how to get things'.  In truth, there isn't really a definitive\u000astoryline, the film merely chronicles the trials and tribulations\u000aexperienced by DuFresne over his life imprisonment, during which time he\u000abecomes a financial advisor to the prison guards and makes friends in high\u000aplaces, although the Warden Norton (Gunton) has other plans for his\u000atalents.A dynamic twist in the tale is the perfect finale to this exceptional film\u000aof which there is not a bad word to be said.  The 2 hrs 17 mins simply flies\u000aby and by the end this magnificent story of courage, friendship, loyalty and\u000aultimately hope will leave you feeling warm, extremely satisfied and ready\u000afor another viewing.  A beautiful movie.\u000a

V\u000a\u000aLow budget, weak at the box office, winless at the Academy Awards, and\u000aoften\u000aconsidered a weak and clitched film.  It's too bad that the greatest film\u000aever made is also the most underrated.The Shawshank Redemption is the story of Ellis Redding (Red), and his\u000aviews\u000aon life, society, and an inmate named Andy Dufresne.The story is flawless, the score is memorable, the cinematography is\u000asplendid, and the movie flows at a smooth pace all the way through its\u000athree\u000ahour length.  While it often appears to be a weak film at first glance, it\u000areally just requires multiple viewings.  After several viewings, anyone\u000acan\u000abegin to realize its greatness.While movie critics can keep calling Citizen Kane the greatest, I realize\u000ait\u000adoesn't come close to so much as comparing to Shawshank.  Citizen Kane\u000adoesn't let its viewers relate to its character, think his every thought,\u000awalk his every step, or breathe his every breath.  Citizen Kane is a\u000apuzzling and riveting masterpiece, but like most "greats", it doesn't\u000acompare to The Shawshank Redemption.The Shawshank Redemption is leagues away from any film I've ever seen in\u000aterms of greatness.  It is timeless, memorable, original, and ultimately\u000athe\u000abest film I probably will ever see. \u000a

V\u000a\u000aI saw this movie for the first time a year and a half ago.  I liked it, but\u000aI didn't remember how much until it was on TV today.  Everything comes\u000atogether so well at the end, and on repeated viewing, there is a whole new\u000alevel to it.Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman are both exceptional in their roles.  Robbins\u000aplays Andy Dufresne, a convicted murderer who goes to Shawshank Prison where\u000ahe is befriended by Red (Morgan Freeman), who has already served 20 years\u000athere.  Despite the hardships of prison, Andy refuses to lose hope, and he\u000atries to inspire Red to feel as he does.I can't think of one scene that was wasted.  Everything helped build to the\u000amovie's conclusion.  Every character was important, as was every line of\u000adialogue.I actually cried at the end.  This movie really makes you think and touches\u000ayour heart.  Next to Pulp Fiction, the best movie of the\u000a90's.\u000a

V\u000a\u000aThe Shawshank redemption is one of a very few movies that\u000alives\u000aup to the book it is based upon. Many Stephen King books\u000abecome\u000aalmost unrecognizable on the screen, but this one, like\u000a'The\u000aGreen Mile', stays true to the feel and rhythm of the book.\u000aEvery time I watch it, I appreciate it more.

V\u000a\u000aI had heard a lot about this movie, but I didn't expect it would be so good!\u000a This is an extraordinary tale of hope and perseverance.  The acting was\u000aterrific, especially by Morgan Freeman as "Red."  This film definitely\u000ashould have won Best Picture.  It should not be compared to "The Green Mile"\u000awhich was also directed by Frank Darabont.  In my opinion, the only\u000asimilarity between the two is the prison setting.  "Shawshank" is an\u000ainspiring and uplifting tale, while "The Green Mile" is depressing. \u000a"Shawshank" is Darabont's best, and it deserves a 10 out of 10.  \u000a\u000a

V\u000a\u000aTogether with "Papillon", The Shawshank Redemption is the best prison\u000amovie\u000aever. It is of the kind that makes a print in memory. There are many\u000astories\u000awithin one story without disturbing the unity: a perfect stream. The story\u000aunfolds in many ways. The stories of the lost souls of modern\u000asystem..Dufrane's innocence and neverfading hope, Red's friendship and wisdom, and\u000aother characters: all of them are equally important. Watch it several\u000atimes,\u000ayou'll find something interesting each time.You'll think where is the prison: inside or outside? The modern system is\u000asuch overwhelming, Dufrane cannot escape it even in jail. He has to pay\u000athe\u000aprice of his innocence in such a world. But he decodes the system and\u000aprepares his individual salvation to go to the ocean which has no memory.\u000aRed is another story: he seems to sink into a total submission and a\u000asilent\u000aresignation till he sees the neverfading hope of Dufrane. The part where\u000aDufrane plays an Italian song to all locking the door is perfect. And that\u000abig tree where Red goes to pick up the money and note Dufrane left: it is\u000aunforgettable.\u000a

V\u000a\u000aThis film is based on Stephen King's story Rita Hayworth and Shawshank\u000aRedemption. It was part of a collection of four short novels, among them Apt\u000aPupil (adapted by Bryan Singer) and The Body (made into Stand By Me by Rob\u000aReiner). Shawshank was a great story and the film adaption by Frank Darabont\u000ais brilliant. The film is highlighted by the strong performances of Morgan\u000aFreeman and Tim Robbins.This movie has everything you could want in a film: inspiring story of\u000apeople persevering through bad times, strong directing and acting (two of\u000athe very best actors of today) and one of the classic endings I've seen in a\u000amovie.Shawshank is well-made and inspiring. It has joined my personal movie\u000ahall-of-fame, which includes The Grapes of Wrath, High Noon, Goodfellas,\u000aL.A. Confidential and Bugsy. I also reccomend The Green Mile, Darabont's\u000amost recent King adaption. \u000a\u000a

V\u000a\u000aThis is, without a doubt, one of the most gripping movies that I've ever\u000aseen.  The script is well written and proves once again that Stephen King\u000ais\u000aa masterful story teller.  I've definitely seen a few King movies that have\u000aleft a bit to be desired, but this is not it.  King is at his best on this\u000aone.Let's not forget the stunning performances of Tim Robbins and Morgan\u000aFreeman.  There couldn't be a better pairing then these to gentlemen.  This\u000awas a defining role for Robbins as he broke out of his typical `funny\u000amovie'\u000arole and proved without a doubt that he is an actor in every sense of the\u000aword.  I gained new respect for this man after seeing this movie and gladly\u000asee anything he does.Morgan Freeman succeeded in further cementing himself in my mind as one of\u000athe great actors of today.  He makes you believe that the saying is true;\u000a`They sentence you to life and that's exactly what they\u000aget.'Don't take my word for it, see it for yourself.  Don't just rent it,\u000athough,\u000abuy it because you'll have to own it once you've seen it and there's no\u000asense in throwing away your money on the rental.\u000a\u000a

V\u000a\u000aMany, many people jock this movie, calling it an intelligent, philosophical\u000aand moving epic, but It's really not all that.  It is a good movie, but it\u000ais not great or thought provoking at all.  That year, 1994, was a great year\u000afor movies considering Pulp Fiction, Ed Wood and Quiz Show among others, yet\u000apeople think Forrest Gump and Shawshank Redemption are great' movies?  Gag\u000ame.Here's some of the problems (Don't read this if you haven't seen the\u000amovie)Morgan Freeman's character - Don't get me wrong Freeman is a great actor\u000a(even if he always plays the same part) but seriously, did you ever watch\u000aMTV's Scared Straight' or listened to Chris Rock's stand-up?  Now tell me\u000awhat kind of 18-year-old murderer goes to prison and kicks around using\u000awords that would make Edgar Allen Poe go get his copy of Webster's? \u000aFreeman's character's narration also served as a purpose to constantly\u000abludgeon the viewer with 2nd rate philosophy people who've never been to\u000aprison come up with.  By the end I was literally exhausted from the constant\u000astream of corny insight I've already heard.  Tell the truth now... If you\u000asaw a murderer on the evening news you'd probably want him dead or at least\u000ain prison for life, yet here you're supposed to rejoice in his parole as a\u000aresult of a tired, bitch-em-out-I-don't-care speech that only seems to come\u000aup in movies.  Another detraction to the narration is Morgan Freeman\u000adropping the F, it never sounds right.The Warden - How many absolutely despicable characters has that guy played? \u000aHas anyone that evil ever run a prison?  That is classic jail movie\u000amaterial.  Obviously the filmmakers realize people will be upset about\u000aglorifying criminals so the answer is to make the authority pure evil.  How\u000airritating If you want to convey criminals, just show them having fun and\u000abeing real people; don't try to cover it up with evil police, try Bonnie and\u000aClyde or Pulp Fiction, much more interesting.Brooks  Some serious button pushing here.  Brooks is a typical, lame\u000aattempt to draw out some sentiment.  The bird thing is a rip off of Escape\u000afrom Alcatraz and like Freeman's character he's a great guy who happened to\u000acommit an offense so despicable he's in one of the most secure prisons in\u000athe country, but we can forget about that, right?  The `Brooks was here'\u000ahanging himself because he can't keep up is another Hollywood favorite.  Who\u000ahangs themselves?  My gosh, at Nuremberg guys took poison to avoid being\u000ahanged because of the shame and disrespect.  Yet, Brooks hung himself when\u000aat his age he could have waited a week and let nature take its course.   Or\u000abetter yet if Brooks got an old-fashioned whore and binged himself to death\u000aon alcohol and mind-altering drugs.   Almost sounds like fun, who would\u000aprefer hanging?  You know who, a character in a movie.  That pretty much\u000asums up the Shawshank Redemption, for what its aiming for it misfires\u000abecause there is nothing genuine or authentic about it.\u000a

This\u000ais NOT standard Hollywood material.\u000aIt has been pointed out that, in general, optimism is equated with\u000aignorance.  I was of that opinion as well, but this was truly a\u000aLIFE-CHANGING movie for me.  This wasn't a movie so much as it was a\u000awake-up\u000acall.  I've seen all the classics.  But nothing I've encountered has\u000aconveyed such a message of positivity and hope as this movie, without\u000abeing\u000acontrived or obvious.\u000aTo all those who pour negative reviews on "Shawshank", stop being a\u000acritic, and start being human.  To everyone else, I think we're all better\u000apeople for having seen it.\u000a

V\u000a\u000aPerhaps the only thing more remarkable than this masterpiece of a movie is\u000athe fact that neither Tim Robbins nor Morgan Freeman won Oscars for their\u000aperformances.  I would put Freeman's portrayal of Ellis Redding amongst the\u000abest performances ever in a movie...so moving, so powerful.  And the fact\u000athat this film did not win Best Picture is all the more unsettling.This movie isn't just about a couple of guys in prison.  Anyone who sees\u000athat, well, that must be where the "1" ratings came from.  The message of\u000ahope is so positively inspiring.  This is a movie that immensely impacted my\u000alife, something I can't say about any other film.  Forrest Gump?  Sure it\u000awas a good movie, but it really was just about a slow-witted man on a bench\u000adiscussing his life.  It never should have won Best Picture.  I'm not sure\u000aif the MPAA ever saw this movie, maybe that explains it.  Not only was the\u000aacting magnificent, but the ending is one of the best in movie history.  I'm\u000aa 19 year old male, and I can't remember the last time I cried for anything.\u000aBut the final scene in The Shawshank Redemption reduced me to tears.  If\u000athere is anyone reading this who has not seen this movie, you would be doing\u000ayourself a huge injustice if you didn't run to the video store immediately.\u000aI've seen all the "Great" movies -- Citizen Kane, Casablanca, Godfather (not\u000ato mention American Beauty, the most overrated movie ever), but none of them\u000aeven comes so close as to compare to this movie.  Plain and simple, the\u000aShawshank Redemption is the best movie I have ever seen, and it will be a\u000avery long time before something better comes along.  20/10 if I\u000acould.\u000a

V\u000a\u000aA beautiful film.  I must have seen it twenty times.  No joke.  Thomas\u000aNewman's haunting musical score still touches me with every viewing.  This\u000ais one of those films that plays on TV almost constantly and yet you still\u000afind yourself watching it every time.  I guess its because of its epic scale\u000aand like a great painting you can find some new in it each time you view\u000ait.Frank Darabont does a great adaptation of Stephen King's novella from his\u000a'Different Seasons' collection.  I guess the theme of each novella in the\u000abook relates to the different seasons.  The quote 'hope springs eternal' is\u000aat the preface of the Shawshank section of the book and if you've seen the\u000afilm you know hope is the movie's central theme.Morgan Freeman and Tim Robbins make a great pair in this, probably the best\u000aon screen pair since Redford and Newman.  See this film and you may become a\u000aShawshank fanatic like so many other people.  \u000a

Several reviews have\u000atried to boil this movie down into a few phrases, usually not doing it\u000ajustice. This movie is about the growing and intimate friendship of the\u000atwo\u000amain characters, and is possibly the best male friendship movie ever\u000amade.If only Steven King would stick to movies like this and Stand By Me,\u000ainstead\u000aof the supernatural horror films.

He has an uncanny\u000aknack\u000afor helping you know a character better than it's screentime should allow.\u000aYou just know who Red is in this film, in your heart.HBO's showing several years ago included a couple of cut-out scenes that\u000awere fantastic, and are worth looking for if you like this movie.\u000a\u000a

V\u000a\u000aI suppose I can't call it the single best film ever, but I really like it.\u000aI\u000amust admit I don't understand the people who call it too sappy. I'm usually\u000apretty observant about sap, but I find this film truly touching.\u000aWell-written, well-filmed, well-acted, it is very moving from beginning to\u000aend. Some necessary changes were made from the original novella, such as\u000amaking it one warden instead of several, changing over\u000atime.The warden, in my opinion, is one of the rare well-made bad guys. You don't\u000alike him at all, but he still has human motivations, not super-evil,\u000aover-the-top unbelievable qualities. Of course, Red and Andy are both\u000awell-crafted characters.It's a fine, understated film. I think it's one of the best films of the\u000apast several years. Good music, too.One more thing: I saw somewhere the complaint that no one seems to age,\u000athough the movie spans several years. While the aging process isn't given\u000athe full focus of the film, it's clearly there. I don't think that's a\u000avalid\u000acomplaint. My two cents are now used up.\u000a

V\u000a\u000aAfter being slightly dissappointed by "The Green Mile", I decided to check\u000aout Frank Darabont's first adaptation of a Steven King prison story once\u000aagain. "The Shawshank Redemption" remained as much of an enjoyably original\u000amodern classic after this second viewing. In this second viewing, I\u000aappreciated even more the sparklingly sharp dialogue between Morgan Freeman\u000aand Tim Robbins. Like in "Green Mile", Darabont set the scene of a\u000adepression-era prison extremely well. The director was also well-served to\u000ause King's vivid character descriptions to make the supporting characters as\u000amemorable as the leads. The result was an instant, uplifting classic about\u000ahope brought to the most\u000ahopeless locations.\u000a

It does not make any insultingly wrongful turns in logic nor\u000adoes it infringe on your conception of what is believable and what is\u000aexcruciatingly unbelievable.This is a no-frills story of a man who is wrongfully accused of murdering\u000ahis wife. The film's glorious irony, that his 19-years-long jail sentence is\u000athe best thing to happen to him in his life, slowly manifests itself.\u000a

V\u000a\u000aI do not normally consider myself to be much of a drama fan, having always\u000apreferred the action-adventure genre. "The Shawshank Redemption" is the film\u000athat changed that feeling for me, and reading the other comments and\u000areviews, for a lot of other people as well.  Frank Darabont made a giant\u000aleap forward from his previous efforts in the "B" horror film world when he\u000acame up with this gem.  Tim Robbins turned in his best performance as Andy\u000aDufresne, and Morgan Freeman was brilliantly cast as Red.  This is a\u000a"Feel-Good" movie of the first order, and well worth it's number 2 ranking\u000aon the IMDb top 250.  Everything works in this film, the score, the acting,\u000athe realism of the prison scenes, absolutely  everything!  "Shawshank" is as\u000aclose to a perfect film as you will ever see.  If you do not already own a\u000acopy of this masterpiece, run, do not walk, to the video store and purchase\u000aa copy.  It should be in the library of every movie fan.  A 5 star, 10 out\u000aof 10, classic movie!!\u000a

V\u000a\u000aOkay, I will not reiterate what praises others have said about this movie. I\u000athink it's brilliant and touching, and others have expressed this more\u000aeloquently than I can. See for yourself.  I just wish IMDB had a 1 to 100 scale for rating movies, instead of 1 to 10.\u000a Then I could give this movie a perfect 100, while giving something like\u000a"Cinema Paradiso" a 94 or 95. As it stands, I gave both movies a ten, but I\u000athink Shawshank is a shade better, and I wish a new ratings could reflect\u000athat opinion.\u000a

V\u000a\u000aFor me, the best movies inspire emotion.  This movies does just that for\u000ame,\u000abetter than any other movie to date.The message here is one of mostly one of hope with a dash of justice\u000athrown\u000ain.  There is hope for the unjustly incarcerated, and justice for those\u000awho\u000ado wrong.  Andy DeFresne, despite all the odds against him, never lets the\u000asituation get to him. Red finds his hope through Andy.The onscreen performances are superb. Every character has dimension and\u000aadds\u000ato the message.  The screenplay, the most important component of any\u000amovie,\u000ais simply flawless.\u000a

It has beenbrilliantly directed, the actors have done a wonderful job andthe story is perfect. I recommend it to everybody.But... yes there is a but, I thought it just missed a littlesomething. That's the reason I gave it a 9 instead of a 10. This film is a product of craftmanship, but it isn't art. And this iswhat makes a film truly great. Everything has been put in theright place, but it misses some originality, some magic touch.It's a brilliant movie, but it doesn't compare to other movieslike American Beauty or American History X, which truly changeyour way of thinking.\u000a

V\u000a\u000aFor those who have not seen The Shawshank Redemption, you have, so far,\u000amissed a genuine treat. I have seen hundreds of films. I don't think I have\u000aever seen more than two or three that combined what I consider to be the\u000afive basic aspects requisite for consideration as a masterpiece. This is\u000aone\u000aof those films. The five basic elements are great acting--in which we the\u000aviewer see the character, feel the character, not the actor; a great\u000ascore/sound-track; a cinematic quality that enables the viewer to\u000aexperience\u000athe surroundings, not just view them; great dialogue and non-dialogue--the\u000abest scripts usually utilize not only the verbal abilities of actors, but\u000anon-verbal expression as well (see a film with Cary Grant or Robert De Niro\u000ato know what I mean); and most important a compelling story.The Shawshank Redemption not only offers ALL of these, but does so at a\u000alevel few films have ever reached.The basic plot is simple enough: a man is wrongly convicted of murdering\u000ahis\u000awife and the man with whom she is having an affair. Why then is it so\u000agreat?\u000aThe performances, all around, but especially of Robbins and Freeman are so\u000arich, so human, the viewer feels they are living their experiences. The\u000afilm\u000ademonstrates, magnificently, how a man can create a meaningful life against\u000ahorrid (mentally and physically) circumstances. The film wrenches the guts\u000aof its viewers, yet provides great satisfaction in the end. It is a great\u000afilm celebrating determination, friendship, revenge (as sweet as you will\u000aever see), education, and the basic goodness intrinsic to all\u000apeople.\u000a\u000a

V\u000a\u000aWhen one thinks of how many dross films have somehow managed to win Oscars\u000ayou begin to lose faith when the classic SR doesn't even win\u000aone.For the life of me I don't know why this film was overlooked - sure the\u000acritics didn't like it, and it didn't do too well at the Box Office because\u000athe title was just too difficult or ambiguous to remember. Nevertheless by\u000athe time it went to Video the film has had a second life to the point where\u000ait is in the top three films of all time according to the members of IMDb,\u000aand rightly so.Prison films are nothing new of course, and neither is SR. But SR shines\u000afrom so many areas that it has to be the best prison film\u000aever.I was particularly impressed with the cinematography from Roger Deakins,\u000aespecially those wonderful sweeping pan shots from of the prison taken from\u000aabove.The acting is a revelation from all concerned especially Morgan Freeman who\u000areally should have won an Oscar. But then there's Robbins himself who I've\u000anever really warmed to, except perhaps for Jacobs Ladder. But he really is a\u000atour-de-force here and should be proud of this film.But the acting plaudits go deeper than just the two main stars; the support\u000afrom Bob Gunton, William Sadler & especially Clancy Brown also deserve huge\u000acredit.Its a very hard, uncompromising film but it doesn't play to stereotype. The\u000aviolence is very real and yet warranted I think. It does fall to the cliche trap on one or two occasions - the ending,\u000aalthough generally well done, was perhaps just a little pretencious for my\u000aliking, especially the preachy monologue from Freeman jarred just a\u000atad.Another annoying thing is the ageing process. Robbins hardly ages at all\u000aduring his 20 year stay...but I'm quibbling.SR is a superb, moving & rewarding film full of hope & belief. The sudden\u000asurge of emotional energy that went through me as Robbins stands in the\u000apool, his arms outstretched as the rain lashes down on\u000ahim!In my virtual world The Shawshank Redemption won 10 Oscars and became a Box\u000aOffice champ and was loved by the critics. The real world, just like the\u000areal world outside Shawshank Prison, is simply too cruel to want to think\u000aabout!\u000a

Morgan Freeman\u000adelivers a truly brilliant performance that received a well-deserved Academy\u000aAward nomination. Bob Gunton gives a wonderfully villainous, intense\u000aperformance as Warden Norton. Darabont's direction is solid. The climax is\u000awonderfully uplifting. On a personal note, I thought this film slowed down\u000aat times but these sequences were essential to the plot, they just seemed to\u000adistract me. This film is definetly worth a look.\u000a

V\u000a\u000aThis film is, with no shadow of a doubt what so ever, the best movie that I\u000ahave ever had the wonderous pleasure to view. Films like Shawshank are what\u000aallow me to love movies and to cherish wonderful stories. I can say that\u000aI'm\u000aa critical gremlin- I'm constantly attempting to find faults, flaws and\u000aplot\u000aholes in every movie i see- yes, I'm that guy who always says it was only\u000aan\u000aok movie when you loved it- But... this one is so powerful, so beautiful,\u000aso\u000aabsolutely inspiring that I couldn't care if there was a plot hole or a\u000aflaw, its just too good of a film to attack. To Hell with Forest Gump for\u000awinning over Shawshank, to Hell with Titanic, Shakespeare in garbage, The\u000aEnglish Idiot, and Forest Dump- these movies all sucked, sucked, sucked to\u000abegin with but compared to the diamond jewel of Shawshank, they look as\u000agood\u000aas sitcoms made by Fox. So anyway, my favorite movie of all time and only\u000aone of three movies worthy of a ten rating.   \u000a

V\u000a\u000aBased on Stephen Kings novel, this film tells the tale of a man (Tim Robbins\u000ain excellent form), sentanced to 2 life sentances for the double murder of\u000ahis wife and her lover.Inside he meets Red (Morgan Freeman) and over the next 20 years tells the\u000astory of his life and the lives around him.This is not a very happy movie although (turn away if you dont want any idea\u000aof the ending) has a happy ending. Thats a double negative, but the film\u000ashows the graphic violence of prisons in the 1940's, where men are\u000aforcefully raped.Two lines (both spoken by Freeman) really stand out in this film.

V\u000a\u000aIt's a great thing when you can finally find a movie you can definitively\u000acall "your favorite".  This is mine.  "The Shawshank Redemption", based on\u000aStephen King's short novella entitled "Rita Hayworth and Shawshank\u000aRedemption", is an excellent adaptation of said literature...I will go out\u000aand say it; I've read the story and seen the movie, and although the movie\u000atook some parts out (in the story, there were three different wardens over\u000athe course of the story, and Red was Irish, not black), it expanded the\u000adetail greatly, covering parts the novella never bothered to touch on (such\u000aas Andy getting a new set of clothes and a shiny pair of shoes from the\u000aWarden ^_^).  The characters are all detailed and alive, not once did I\u000afind\u000aa character unbelievable.\u000aAnd I've never EVER seen an ending so incredible.  My eyes were wide, I was\u000achanting "Oh My God" over and over...This movie makes you feel good all\u000aover\u000aand gives you a new perspective on life and freedom.\u000aThis movie is nothing short of a masterpiece.  The only fault I find is\u000athat\u000ait came out at the time as Forrest Gump, which had a lot more advertising\u000aand thus beat this great movie out in the box office.  Had it come out a\u000afew\u000amonths later, it would have been much more successful.\u000a

V\u000a\u000aI have read the short story (novella?) by Steven King and seen this great\u000afilm and I have to say that this is one time when Hollywood did a better job\u000athen the author. I've seen tons of prison movies (some with good plots and\u000aothers that are complete B movies) and this has to be the best one out\u000athere. Usually when I like a movie, I can watch it a bunch of times. And I\u000ahave seen Shawshank many times, but none of the repeated viewings were as\u000agood as the first. Clancy Brown (he was great in Highlander too) once again\u000asteals the show as a Hard A--- prison guard who gets his just desserts in\u000athe end.

V\u000a\u000aThe Shawshank Redemption was a film that I was always on my way to the\u000atheater to see, but unfortunately, I got sidetracked each and every time.\u000aCritics felt that the long title kept people away, I guess I was in that\u000acategory, no matter how great I heard this movie was. I finally saw the\u000amovie the day it hit videotape. To this day, it continues to dominate the\u000anumber one position on my list of favorite films of all time.

V\u000a\u000aTo begin with,  The story is pretty well cliched.  Like most prison dramas\u000ahope and struggle seem to be the element that put the plot together.  For\u000aonce this is probably the one time that such a cliched plot actually\u000aworked.\u000aI have personally seen this movie over 20 times just to figure out how\u000aand\u000awhy it works so well.  First of all the story is deep and thought\u000aprovoking.\u000aMorgan Freeman's voice over narrative lets you see it through his eyes\u000a(the\u000amovie is really about him).  The acting is flawless the whole picture is\u000ashot as a true epic.  This is one great film about friendship and hope\u000athat\u000adoes not dwell to much on pathos and mindless sentimentality.

V\u000a\u000aI remember seeing The Shawshank Redemption back in '94 and thinking how\u000aabsolutely out of the ordinary it was for a Hollywood picture. No soft soap\u000aending, no moral message and no "Whey-hey isn't America great" that you\u000ausually get from Hollywood pics. The fact its a Steven King is remarkable\u000ato, out of his usual style, I think. It's photographed beautifully and makes\u000ano bones about the harsh reality of prison.

V\u000a\u000aThis would have to be THE best movie that I have ever seen. The story of a\u000awrongly convicted man. And the story of a man searching for meaning. And the\u000astory of an institutionalised man. This movie takes several different\u000astories and turns them into one fantastic film.Watch it a number of times to see all the stories come together in an\u000ainspiring manner that touches the soul. I can't recommend this movie enough.\u000aMorgan Freeman's performance of the narrating Red, and explanations of\u000aprison life are truly touching. Tim Robbins' portrayal of Andy is near\u000aperfect, no, it IS perfect.Watch it, then watch it again.You won't be disappointed.\u000a

V\u000a Locked in the confines of prison, one expects the insanities to unfold, to\u000abreak the human spirit and rape it of its essence, but one thing above all\u000aelse allows survival for even the misjudged guilt of one man who must wake\u000aup to realize the awful truth. That thing is hope, and it breathes through\u000aevery inch of this movie, as well as a sensational feeling of greatness.Every moment and every bit of emotion is genuine, well spent. The whole feel\u000aand experience of it all will not only touch the little person inside us\u000aall, but will also give you a taste of a great story and masterful film\u000amaking. I have always loved this movie, from the moment I first saw it in\u000atheaters, and every further time I see it when watching it from my video\u000acollection. Films like this continue to inspire me in my own endeavours, to fully\u000aengross me within its stone walls, to make me realize every bit how precious\u000afreedom truly is. May this movie live on in the collections of everyone,\u000aand may no person have to experience even a fraction of the pain and\u000asuffering found in this great film...\u000a

V\u000a\u000aAs near to perfect as a movie can get, "The Shawshank Redemption" is\u000aabsolutely superlative entertainment.  I keep wondering at those who claim\u000athe movie is too long (as many also did for the fantastic "Green Mile").  I\u000awonder if MTV, television newscasts, commercials and other things have\u000adestroyed the attention span of several generations of people.  Nobody seems\u000ato be able to stick with anything for more than an absolute maximum of two\u000ahours anymore.  It's a disappointing trend, because often a great story\u000acannot be told in the usual 120-minute maximum alloted to most\u000afilms.If you have the attention span to watch a film longer than two hours, movies\u000ajust don't get any better than this one does.  Don't look for realism (try\u000aPBS or any documentary for that), look for plot, acting talent and (above\u000aall): Simply a good, satisfying tale!  The Shawshank Redemption has it all,\u000ain spades, and Frank Darabont is on his way to an absolutely stellar\u000adirecting career.  Kudos to Stephen King as well for his excellent novella,\u000a"Rita Hayworth and Shawshank Redemption," which obviously helped make this\u000afilm possible.  10/10.\u000a

V\u000a\u000aWhen it comes to analyzing the true meanings of movies I'm no expert, but\u000athis movie really gave me a feel of inner hope and confidence. I mean, put\u000ayour self in Andy Dufresne's(Tim Robbins) position. If you were in prison\u000afor something that not only did you not do but was being accused of\u000amurdering someone that you loved and cared for. And you go to prison for\u000awhat 30? 40 years? and day after day you dig and you dig and you dig, and\u000awith what?? a spoon!! I know I would have gone nuts by then. BUT Andy gave\u000ahope, and he also gave Red(Morgan Freeman) hope. And I think that was the\u000amain aspect of the whole movie. Which is, in no matter what type of\u000acircumstances there is always one Andy Dufresne giving hope. Go find\u000ayours!!!!I gave this movie a 8/10.\u000a

V\u000a\u000aI'm embarrassed to say that I just saw this movie last night, nearly six\u000ayears after it came out.  And I like to think of myself as a film buff.The film was excellent.  It was masterfully directed and flawlessly acted\u000awith superb performances by everyone in the cast.  However, what stands out\u000aabove other movies is Shawshank's screenplay.  A movie can be directed and\u000aacted brilliantly, it can have incredible special effects, but I think that\u000awithout a good story and dialogue, the movie has no skeleton.  This story is\u000aso good that it would have done well even with average acting and directing.\u000aThe message is an important one for anybody with blood in their veins: the\u000aworld can take everything from you but hope; that is something that you have\u000ato give away by yourself.  And hope is the most valuable thing you own.I'd like to think that years from now, Stephen King will be remembered for\u000ahis films and stories like this one, Stand by Me, and The Green Mile.  While\u000ahe is the master of horror, and his horror stories are very good, these\u000astories are so profound, so meaningful.  They show that King truly\u000aknows very much about the essence and the strength of the human\u000aspirit.\u000a

V\u000a\u000aAs stated in the tagline, this is a film of hope. The difficult question\u000ais\u000ahowever, is whom does it refer to? The two lead characters (Andy Dufresne\u000aand 'Red' Redding, played superbly by Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman\u000arespectively) are both inmates at Shawshank penitentiary, one innocent and\u000athe other guilty. This however, does not mar your opinion of either\u000acharacter - you are able to sympathise with both of them, as you are with\u000amany of the prisoners. You root for these criminals every inch of the way,\u000adespite their wayward past and current situations. This is perhaps the\u000aultimate feelgood movie, with the greatest twist since Kevin Spacey walked\u000aaway in The Usual Suspects. Unlike other films of this genre however,\u000athere\u000ais no need for constant assurance that this will make you feel good - bar\u000aone or two moments in the middle, there is no hint that anything positive\u000awill happen to either hero, right up until that moment.The greatest factor in this movie must be the characterisation. Prison\u000aguards turn from monsters, to friends to cowards; prisoners range from the\u000ahorrific, to cruel, to pitiful and finally to likable. Above all, unlike\u000atoo\u000amany recent films, each and every character is human and\u000abelievable.Is there an answer to that question? Which character has the lead - the\u000anarrating Red or the centrepiece Andy? Who has the hope? The answer to\u000athat\u000alies in the interpretation of a film that can mean anything.\u000a\u000a

V\u000a\u000aBeing the cynic that I am, it's my inclination to look for the weaknesses\u000aof\u000afilms that ultimately detract from their overall quality. How refreshing\u000ait\u000ais that, on occasion, a film is so masterfully crafted that I can simply\u000atake in all that it has to offer. Such is the case with _The Shawshank\u000aRedemption_.And with _The Shawshank Redemption_, it isn't an issue of the excellence\u000aof\u000athe different components of the film; instead, it's an issue of the way\u000athat\u000aall of the elements of this movie-- the writing, directing, and acting--\u000aare\u000aso vastly superior to those of most every other film.It's difficult to imagine two things more cliched than "Prison Dramas" and\u000afilms about "The Triumph of the Human Spirit." Though _The Shawshank\u000aRedemption_ certainly qualifies as both of those cinematic cliches,\u000athere's\u000anothing about the film that seems even the least bit tired. The unique\u000acharacters of Red and Andy Dufrense bring an unexpected liveliness to a\u000afilm\u000athat could have easily been both obvious and trite-- such as _The Green\u000aMile_.Because of the intelligently-written screenplay, with its engaging plot\u000atwists and historically appropriate dialogue, coupled with truly\u000aremarkable\u000aperformances by both Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman that convey all of the\u000adepth and honesty of their challenging characters, _Shawshank_ improves\u000aupon\u000athe repeated viewings that are necessary to take in all that it has to\u000aoffer. The unparalleled depth of this movie allow the viewer to gain\u000asomething new-- and something ultimately positive-- from each additional\u000aviewing.Perhaps the greatest achievement of _The Shawshank Redemption_ is the\u000arestraint that director Frank Darabont uses in unfolding this multifaceted\u000astory. When approaching a film with even a fraction of the thematic load\u000aof\u000athis one, most directors simply succumb to the too-easy temptation to tack\u000aa\u000adidactic, heavy-handed morality statement onto the last sequence. Darabont\u000aattains a rare closure; he _doesn't_ moralize. He allows the viewer to\u000amake\u000ahis/her own judgments about each of the characters and the fate that he\u000aultimately meets over the course of the film.RATING: 10 out of 10. In a decade, _The Shawshank Redemption_ will be\u000agrouped into the cinematic canon alongside such triumphs as _Citizen Kane_\u000aand _Dr. Strangelove_. It's not an unmerited distinction. An example of\u000atruly flawless filmmaking.\u000a

V\u000a\u000aAt the risk of gushing... I just have to comment that this film takes my\u000abreath away every time I watch it.  I can never seem to pass by the channel\u000awhen it's on TV.  I cry every time I see it.  It's a good cry though, a\u000a"feeling something" cry.  Sometimes in the rush of daily life you can\u000aforget\u000awhat it's like to simply FEEL your emotions.  As other people have said\u000ahere\u000a- each time you watch this film, more layers of story are revealed to you.\u000aThe whole experience of it -- the music, the atmospheric,\u000athis-feels-like-a-real-place setting, the poetic quality of Morgan\u000aFreeman's\u000anarration (and what a voice he has!), the characters who seem like real\u000apeople instead of stereotypes, and the theme of the survival of hope even\u000ain\u000athe most oppressive of circumstances -- is very spiritual. I experience the\u000agamut of emotions during this film but wind up feeling inspired and\u000auplifted.  I feel as though I've taken the journey beside Andy and Red.\u000aThis movie does indeed stay with you; you find yourself pondering its\u000aelements and marvelling at its beautiful simplicity.  It's a movie that\u000arequires you to pay close attention and I certainly agree that more than\u000aone\u000aviewing is necessary to appreciate everything it wants to offer to the\u000aviewer.  What a treasure this movie is.  May it be preserved well!!!!  I\u000ahope... I hope... \u000a

V\u000a\u000aI'm kind of lost for words for this movie. I saw it last night on my\u000aDVD-player and what I saw was brilliance. The story is about a banker Andy\u000a(Tim Robbins) who get prisoned for murdering his wife and her secret lover.\u000aIn prison he says he's innocent, which makes the other inmates break out in\u000alaughter. No one is innocent in prison they say. `They've all been f***ed by\u000alawyers.' What follows is a fight for justice. A inmate (George Freeman) who\u000acalls himself Red (the other inmates call him that because he's `irish')\u000afinds something special in Andy. They connect soon and becomes good friends.\u000aWhat strikes me about the main characters is that hope and belief is\u000asomething that they always have. Even though they go through some very tough\u000atimes in prison, they always have that good confidence in themselves. Go see\u000athis movie, if you love the concept of feeling free. There's no let downs or\u000agrief ending this movie. You have to see it for yourself.\u000a

V\u000a\u000aI love just drifting through the IMDb just to read others opinions on\u000acertain movies, and having checked out the comments on Shawshank\u000aRedemption,\u000aI'm amazed that some of the latest reviews are from people who have who\u000ahave\u000aonly just watched it in the last few weeks. I'm even more pleased that they\u000aacknowledge it as one of the best films made, and that it lived up to the\u000ahype that has passed via word of mouth. It is a criminal offence that it\u000adid\u000anot win a single Oscar but at least it not one of those films that will be\u000aclassed as an undiscovered gem. Career best performances are brought out of\u000aall members of the cast: Clancy Brown, Bill Gunton and Bill Sadler will\u000asurely never hit those heights again. It may not have been a box office hit\u000abut all\u000aassociated with the movie should feel proud. The cliche is true of The\u000aShawshank Redemption: they don't make them like that any more.

It\u000asurely would have been a front runner the best picture oscar.  I exclude\u000a'97\u000abecause nothing could have beat the almighty Titanic.

"yes, I believe that i'm\u000aentirely\u000acured.  i believe that i am no longer a danger to society."  he was\u000arejected\u000athose 2 times.  but the third he was honest, and the outcome was far\u000adifferent.  A nearly perfect movie.\u000a

I had very high\u000aexpectations upon seeing it.I was not in the least disappointed. This movie IS all it's made up to be.\u000aYes, without a doubt, you SHOULD see this movie.The story is a thought-provoking one of hope, and how to find meaning in\u000aorder in the apparent chaos of life. Andy escapes from the prison in an\u000aattempt to find himself, after his good friend Brooks, who has been released\u000aafter decades of living in the prison, runs into bad fortune. Andy's other\u000afriend who is also released manages to find himself like Andy did through\u000ahis help. This is a story of the torture humans inflict on one another and\u000ahow it is escaped through hope.10/10\u000a

V\u000a\u000aWhat can you say about a movie that is perfect?  I myself have plenty\u000ato say.  I believe The Shawshank Redemption is the best film ever made\u000abecause it towers above other films in all respects, directorial ability,\u000aacting ability, the story, everything.\u000aDirector Frank Darabont captured the essence of the hopelessness (or\u000asupposed hopelessness) of a dark and desolate prison.Morgan Freeman shines in a supporting role, and Tim Robbins sets the\u000astandards for everything a lead actor should be.  His performance was so\u000agood, so heartfelt, that every time I see the film I feel like I'm the one\u000afighting his battle.\u000aThe entire theme of the film, hope, is so overwhelmingly powerful.\u000aBased on Stephen King's short story, Rita Hayworth and Shawshank\u000aRedemption,\u000athe idea of finding hope in a world where life itself is gone is beyond\u000athe\u000arealms of emotion, it can't be said with words the impact this film makes.\u000aEveryone gets what they deserve in the end, and the glorification of\u000atriumph\u000aand the conquering of fears go beyond imaginable.  As a young lady at 16,\u000aI\u000ahave much trouble sometimes finding something to hold onto since falling\u000ainto a monotonous routine. This film reminds me of the good things in life\u000aand that every day is a new one, and is something to be\u000acherished.\u000aThank God that in a world of shoot-em-up, sex and drug filled,\u000aridiculous films some people still see the true meaning of movie making,\u000ato\u000achange the lives of those watching.  If you have never seen The Shawshank\u000aRedemption, please do.  It is a film of such epic proportions that it\u000amoves\u000ayour soul. \u000a

V\u000a\u000aI had heard so many good things about this movie, that I just had to see it.\u000a I was not disappointed.  This is probably one of the best movies I have\u000aever seen. Period.  Tim Robbins was outstanding, simply outstanding. Morgan\u000aFreeman was wonderful and I did not know that Gil Bellows had so much in\u000ahim.  This movie was absolutely breathtaking.  The scenery, the realism, the\u000acharacters, everything was simply outstanding.  I sat through the entire\u000amovie, spellbound by the whole thing, and then I rewound it and watched\u000aagain.  I've seen 6 times since, and I always find new and wonderful things\u000aeverytime I see it.  I loved it.  It was amazing.  This movie is not just\u000aabout prison, but it's about friendship.  A 20-year-long friendship between\u000atwo inmates.  I recommend this movie for anyone who needs to find out what\u000areal friendship is all about.  This is truly one of the best movies\u000aever.\u000a

V\u000a\u000aThis is another of those films that inexplicably gets the reputation of\u000abeing the best film ever made and a kind of rabid mass psychosis by\u000asuggestion seems to result. I'm amazed at the number of times this turns up\u000awhenever people do a top ten list. Unfailingly, like the proverbial black\u000apenny, up it pops. Yawn. I think kids need to be forcefully tied to a chair\u000aand made to watch some film history. Why on earth does every single thing\u000aStephen King inflicts on the reading public have to be made into a film?\u000aThey'll be making his shopping list next. It would be okay if he was an\u000ainteresting author but the majority of what he turns out is handed down pulp\u000adetritus. This film is a staggering three hours long and full of cliched\u000abathetic corn although freeman does his best. Robbins is an average actor\u000aand his character is a cypher at best. The plot is very silly. Are they\u000areally trying to tell us that no one would check a very prominent item in a\u000acell for fifteen years? There must have been a lot of noise filtering\u000athrough and a draught which would rattle it like mad. I'm sure that's the\u000afirst place they'd check behind for a marijuana stash. And didn't prisoners\u000aget moved around regularly from cell to cell? The come-uppance of the staff\u000awas hugely unlikely too, destroying any poignancy and good will the film may\u000ahave stirred up earlier. It was daft stuff. And we mustn't forget the old\u000astalwart of hack directing, the thunderstorm to highten...well, I don't know\u000awhat really, it's hard to see with all that flashing. I suspose it's\u000astirring for some to see a crane shot of a man holding his arms to the\u000aheavens. It's a highlight of their lives. I call it film making by numbers.\u000aAnd there are a lot of numbers in this film. It's one virtue is it doesn't\u000aduck prison rape.\u000a

V\u000a\u000aThe Shawshank Redemption is a movie about personal disaster, misery,\u000aimpossible difficulties, and eventual triumph.  In other words, it's about\u000alife.Tim Robbins plays Andy Dufresne, a young banker convicted of murdering his\u000awife and her lover, and sent to the Shawshank Prison in Maine for life. \u000aThere he meets Red, an older con played by Morgan Freeman.  From there on,\u000athe movie is viewed through the eyes of Red, and Freeman's moving commentary\u000asurfaces during key points in the flick.  Most of the movie is about the\u000afriendship between Andy and Red, and the different travails they encounter. \u000aThe two learn  about the meaning of hope, and how one must keep going\u000adespite the odds.All this sounds pretty pat and boring, but the movie most assuredly is not. \u000aIt has a brilliant mixture of brutal violence, gentle lyricism and uplifting\u000amoments coming from the most unusual of places.  This could only work with a\u000atop-notch group of actors.   The inhuman actions of Captain Hadley (Clancy\u000aBrown) are enough to turn your head from the screen.   This is tempered by\u000athe relaxed friendship between Freeman and Robbins, as well as the\u000acamaraderie inside Red's group; William Sadler as the stuttering Heywood is\u000aterrific.  James Whitmore is touching as Brooks, the oldest inmate who is so\u000aused to prison life that he can't leave.  Gil Bellows (Tommy) has a small\u000abut pivotal role; his superb performance changes the momentum of the entire\u000amovie.   And the triumvirate of Brown, Mark Rolston (Bogs), and Bob Gunton\u000a(Warden Norton) set the tone of evil in the prison that only the wiles of\u000aAndy and the compassion of Red can surmount.Some critics say that the movie is too slow.  It's slow like a baseball\u000agame; its leisurely pace is belied by the amount of strategy underneath.  \u000aAn important moment happens in almost every scene, whether it's Brooks\u000acrying, Red making a joke, or Andy slyly getting the best of the system, the\u000aend gradually creeps up on us until the surprising, heartwarming finale.  \u000aThe last scene is one of incredible cinematic restraint; the camera actually\u000apulls away from the action, preventing us from seeing the expressions on the\u000acharacters' faces.  We strain to see, not because we need to know what they\u000aare feeling--we already know.  We just want to see as much as we can because\u000ait is so wonderful.I haven't said much about what happens in the movie.  Let's just say that it\u000ashows how one's mind and knowledge are more powerful than concrete walls,\u000amental intimidation or physical force.The Shawshank Redemption was not seen by as many people as it should have\u000abeen, undoubtedly because of its un-sexy title.  Don't be turned off.  It's\u000aone of those movies that can draw you in and give you a lift, no matter what\u000akind of mood you're in.  It's one of the most satisfying movie experiences\u000aI've ever had.  See it.\u000a\u000a

V\u000a\u000aIt was really very easy to like this film - in fact, it was impossible for\u000ame NOT to like it. Maybe the key is the phenomenon that is called "lagom" in\u000aSweden. That word doesn't exist in any other language, but it means\u000asomething like "just right". Not too much, not to little.I felt very comfortable after watching this film. It didn't change my life,\u000adidn't start a revolution - it was just a very good film!Actually, the end was a bit unexpected. It gave the film a romantic touch\u000athat otherwise wouldn't have been there. The only bad thing is that I found\u000adetails in the story too improbable, and that was a disturbing moment in\u000athat type of film. It wouldn't have mattered in an action-filled story, but\u000anow it made me irritated, because it stole attention from the story!!\u000aAnyway that detail doesn't stop me from really recommending this film - its\u000asimply "just right"!\u000a

V\u000a\u000aThis is much more than a prison film.  This is a film about how the human\u000aspirit can conquer the most unspeakable abyss and come out clean at the\u000aother side.  In addition, the story at the heart of it, of Andy (Tim\u000aRobbins) and Red (Morgan Freedman)is simply a story of two men's friendship\u000a-- something seldom explored in cinema, and rarely as well.  Lastly, the\u000atheme of hope echoes and throughout the film and reverberates in the\u000aviewer's minds like an aria against hard prison walls.\u000a\u000a

V\u000a\u000aApologies to all proud Anglophiles, but I have never heard the English\u000alanguage sound so beautiful as during Freeman's narration in the last 20\u000aminutes. Our language has to compete with beautiful languages like Italian,\u000aSpanish and French and Darabont's writing really "stepped up to the plate"\u000ahere.No clichéd romantic tragedy of unrequited love had to unfold (there was\u000aonly\u000aONE female speaking role!!!). Only a story of friendship, hope and inner\u000astrength was needed to bring tears to the eyes during the final\u000anarration.Unlike many movies of the nineties, this movie gets its strength from\u000afantastic characterisation, great pen-to-paper skills and Deakin's\u000acinematography; words and pictures, not 200 gigabtyes of\u000acyber-FX!Despite my admiration of James Cameron, this movie beats "Titanic" as well\u000aas classics like "Casablanca," "African Queen," "Citizen Kane," "Gone with\u000athe Wind," and Hitchcock's "North by Northwest."\u000a

It is excellent.\u000aIt's a calm and unsettling story of a man's (Robbins) life in jail, of the\u000afriendship between him and his fellow lifer, Red (Freeman) and the\u000adisgusting life in a corrupt prison in the 50's and 60's. Excellent\u000aperformances, great camera angles and one of the very best endings of any\u000afilm.Stephen King wrote the story. Why should I be surprised? His novels and\u000ashort stories make for great films - but most are turned into crap, like\u000aIt.\u000aThis one, however, is one of the best movies there is.\u000a

V\u000a\u000aHey, I have to say that this movie is one of my favorites.  It is up on my\u000atop 10.  Anyway, this movie is amazing.  The story, the acting, and\u000aanything\u000aelse you can think of make this movie a classic.  Morgan Freeman (plays\u000athe\u000acharacter red) did an excellent job on his role.  I think he was totally\u000arobbed when he didn't get the Oscar for best supporting actor.  To get\u000aback\u000aon the movie, if you looking for a good one to watch, you have to see\u000athis.\u000aThe movie is wonderfully played.  Also hats off to the great job Tim\u000aRobbins\u000adid playing his main character Andy Dufresne. If you haven't seen this\u000aone,\u000ayour missing out!!\u000a

V\u000a\u000aI read Rita Hayworth and Shawshank Redemption as part of Stephen King's\u000aDifferent Seasons, and loved the story.. to see just how much one person\u000acan\u000ago through, and not only remain sane, but keep his morals about him, even\u000ain\u000athe purgatory of a corrupt prison. The book was incredible. But the movie\u000atook it one step further, with incredibly well chosen actors and a\u000abeautiful\u000asense of the book that is hard to set to a movie, as well as lines that I\u000astill remember at the drop of a hat. Incredible, and one of my favorite\u000amovies of all time.\u000a

V\u000a\u000aI usually hate popular movies(pulp fiction, titanic, forest gump). So I\u000awas\u000avery sceptical when I sat down to watch the currently 4th ranked movie on\u000athe imdb. What can i say, I agree, this movie gets a 10, while some things\u000aare hard to believe(his escape) the range of this movie makes it easy to\u000aignore. There is a lot of depth here. You get to see all the characters\u000agrow\u000aand age, you really get drawn in to the plot. It shows how brutal prison\u000acan\u000abe. And how dependent on the system one can become.\u000aAnother minor thing I didn't like was how after "The Sisters" leader was\u000abeaten and transfered the prison seem to be a utopia except for the guards.\u000aThere should have been at least a little inmate-to-inmate brutality\u000ashown.A great addition to your DVD collection.\u000a

V\u000a\u000aOK, so I am a huge fan of Stephen King as well as of the cinema itself, and\u000ait took me almost 5 years to finally see The Shawshank Redemption.  I think\u000aI was one of the few people on the planet who did not see this fantastic\u000amotion picture.  Everything about this film exudes greatness, from the\u000aperformances of Freeman and Robbins to the masterful screenplay,\u000acinematography, cast and especially the direction.  I agree with most people\u000awho fume over the fact that films such as this one (perfect in every sense)\u000ararely, if ever garner an Oscar win.  Its a shame that the big budget over -\u000ahyped (and often mediocre at best films) win all the awards while a gem like\u000aThe Shawshank Redemption comes up empty.  You never grow tired of watching\u000athis film and its introspective ending is just perfect.  If you are one of\u000athe 4 remaining people who has yet to see this masterpiece, find 2 hours of\u000aquiet time and watch it.  You will thank yourself afterwards.\u000a

V\u000a\u000aConsidering hundreds of thousands have made this their top 4 all-time film,\u000athere isn't much that I can add -- that hasn't already been said (or\u000aknown).Acting -- from lead to support:  superb.   What works the best is the\u000aobvious interaction between Robbins and Freeman, and the internal mechanisms\u000ataking place within themselves and the other.Screenplay -- Intelligent, eternal, interesting sub-plots, gripping, classic\u000aconflicts being resolved in a satisfying manner.  My only beef with the\u000ascript is Freeman's final statement to the parole board.   I realize its\u000airony, but didn't consider it credible.Cinematography -- Every camera angle is well framed, positioned or filtered\u000ain choice moments.This film is an emotionally satisfying experience that leaves one feeling\u000agood about life and its possibilities.  What a wonderful ending.\u000a

V\u000a\u000a I must say that this is the best prison films of all time. I couldn't\u000abelieve that this film didn't win any Academy Awards. This film could have\u000awin at least one or two. Also, I thought that Tim Robbins could have earned\u000aan Oscar nomination. He gave a superb performance. But the one who was\u000apowerful in this film is Morgan Freeman. He gave one of the best\u000aperformances that I have ever seen in film. It was heartwrenching. I like\u000athat tagline: Fear can make you prisoner, Hope can set you free. Frank\u000aDarabont did superb filmmaking in this film. By the way, I found out that\u000aAllen Greene, the person that Frank dedicated at the end, was the director's\u000aagent and his close personal friend. If you want to see a film that takes\u000aplace in a prison or dramatic films, then see this film. You will never\u000aregret it. It is the best prison film since Midnight Express. SEE\u000aIT!\u000a

V\u000a\u000aIts this kind of movie that lets you know the beauty of the world.\u000aAlthough\u000aits kind of ironic that almost all of the movie takes place in a prison,\u000athe\u000aone place in the world where you'd think you'd be restricted from it.\u000aJust\u000aseeing it once lets you walk away from it with the biggest feeling of joy,\u000ano matter how upset you are about anything else, at that time, that one\u000atime, nothing in the world matters.  Once its seen more than once, you\u000asoon\u000abegin to realize all the other side stories and ideas in the movie.  It\u000aseems that every line in the film has some hidden meaning that you love to\u000atry and find.  You'll find yourself returning home every night, and\u000astaying\u000aup, no matter how tired you are, to watch it again.  The acting is great,\u000aand has made Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman my two favorite actors\u000aalongside\u000aKevin Spacey.  The movie gives you the feeling that all the men in the\u000ajail\u000awere imprisoned wrongly and that they are all innocent, but its only\u000abecause\u000athey are actually people and you grow to like and understand them.  The\u000aending is very surprising, and rates among the best endings ever with "The\u000aUsual Suspects", "The Game", and "The Sixth Sense."  The movie is\u000aincredible.  It is an absloute masterpiece in every way possible.  The\u000aacting, the directing, the writing, everything.  The narrating by Morgan\u000aFreeman, who plays Red, is incredible and a story in its own.  The only\u000amovie i know of that can honorably sit alongside this .. is "American\u000aBeauty".  This film is the greatest movie ever, don't listen to anyone\u000aelse.\u000aWhen you see it you will believe it, you will understand.  " So after\u000afirst\u000ameeting him, i guess you could say that I liked Andy from the start." -\u000aRed.No rating could justify this movie.  Perfect.\u000a

V\u000a\u000aI saw this movie a long while ago, and I've seen it about 5 times, but if\u000aI\u000acatch it on TV, I sit back, relax, and watch it again, like if I have\u000anever\u000aseen it before.Tim Robbins has become one of my favorite actors. After this movie and\u000aArlington Road, I think he deserves as much as credit as an actor can get.\u000aMorgan Freeman is also known for making good movies, even when he has made\u000asome bad films, like every good actor alive, of course.The idea of putting this two men together was simply brilliant. I also\u000athink\u000athe Director made a great job.Now lets talk about the movie a little bit...\u000aI think this is the kind of movie that people wants, the kind of movie\u000athat\u000amakes you feel happy after you see it, the kind of movie that you cannot\u000aget\u000aout of your head for a few days after you've seen it. You also think, of\u000acourse, that is so not fair that a person can lose 20 years of his life\u000athat\u000away, being innocent, that the only witness, that can also save you, is\u000amurdered because the director of the Prison does not wants you to leave,\u000asince you are doing a very good job for him.The way that Andy (Robbins) got rid of the three homosexuals that were\u000aabusing him, is excellent, and it also shows how Andy was not afraid of\u000atalking to the guards, and he was not nervous or anything like that, and\u000amost of all, that he was very smart. That was probably what I liked the\u000amost\u000aabout the film, Andy's intelligence.The way he escaped is just fantastic, specially because it could have been\u000atrue, after all, he did not even kill anyone.Maybe, when a person watches me talking like that, thinks that I only give\u000acredit to Robbins for the movie, but that is not true, I think Morgan\u000aFreeman did a very good performance too. After all, the movie would not be\u000athe same without the way he narrates it.I'll rate this movie with a 10 out of 10, I think it really deserves it,\u000aand\u000ait's definitely one of the best movies ever.\u000a

Not only should it have won the 7 Oscars it was up for, but\u000aseveral others it did not even get nominations for.Terence Marsh deserved another Oscar for his set design (yes, that was a\u000aset) of the amazing prison.  James Whitmore gave a performance as great as\u000aany supporting actor that year.  How Tim Robbins did not join Morgan\u000aFreeman\u000ain the Best Actor category (take your pick who to give the Oscar to) is\u000abeyond me.  And the saddest thing, next to the film not winning Best\u000aPicture, is that Frank Darabont did not take home the Best Director Oscar\u000athat was so rightfully his.The Academy will continue handing out its Oscars for "The Best Picture of\u000athe Year" to movies like Titanic, The English Patient, and Forrest Gump.

I has\u000aremained in my mind ever since I saw it.  When I saw this movie, it made a\u000atremendous impact on me.  This is a beautiful movie about triumph and the\u000apower of friendship.  Among other things, this movie contains terrific\u000aperformances.  Perhaps the best performance is that of the great Morgan\u000aFreeman, as a prison inmate.  And of course, Tim Robbins also shines,\u000aplaying the lead character.  There are so many memorable scenes in this\u000amovie.  One particular scene that stands out is the moment when Robbins'\u000acharacter breaks free, and you see him standing in the rain, shirtless and\u000awith his arms stretched out.  But what is the most memorable scene is the\u000aending--a fitting ending to this touching and haunting story.  If you\u000ahaven't seen this movie, definitely do so.

V\u000a\u000aThe Shawshank Redemption appeared and disappeared in 1994 with little steam.\u000a It was heartily acclaimed, but audiences shied away, probably because its\u000astory takes place primarily within the walls of a prison.  However, many,\u000asince then, have found this wonderful gem, and have declared it to be one of\u000athe finest films ever made.The Shawshank Redemption is the story of a young banker, Andy Dufresne,\u000asentenced to life in Shawshank Prison in New England for the murder of his\u000awife and her lover.  The film methodically and sometimes grotesquely depicts\u000aAndy's hard time in an episodic form of many situations, sometimes positive\u000aand enlightening, other times, grisly and disheartening.  Andy's guide on\u000athis trip through hell isn't Dante's Virgil, but Ellis "Red" Redding, a\u000alifer who has a knack at "getting things."  The relationship between these\u000atwo inmates is slow, yet heart-warming, as is the entire pace of the\u000afilm.Andy is portrayed meticulously and intelligently by Tim Robbins, who shows\u000athe banker's transformation from scared "fish" to top dog over a course of\u000amany years.  Morgan Freeman is Red, who sees his decades within the walls of\u000aShawshank as the only true life he has ever known.  These two are supported\u000aby a well-casted group, which includes cameos and extras by real-life prison\u000ainmates.The Shawshank Redemption is a film which pulls the audience in, and while\u000along and slow, captures the imagination and forces the viewer to remain\u000athrough the entire terrific, yet frightening, journey.Highly recommended.\u000a

V\u000a\u000aThis is some Movie! Directed by Frank Darabont, The Shawshank Redemption\u000ashows more than any other film made about Prison life, the hopelessness,\u000afrustration, loneliness and degredation Prison inmates experience. Darabont\u000adoes a great job in capturing the atmosphere of the Gaol, cleverly moving\u000ahis cameras in close to magnify  an emotion or expression as Andy Dufresne,\u000a( Tim Robbins ) ' Red, '  played brilliantly by Morgan Freeman, and many\u000aothers including James Whitmore as the ' institutionalized ' Brooks Hatlen,\u000awrestle daily with their torments and their tormentors. Robbins did some\u000agood work with his character,the snotty banker brought back down to earth in\u000athe form of a prison yard and, as always Freeman gave another polished\u000aperformance as the prison's regular ' Sears and Roebuck ' while giving us\u000aalso a moving narrative throughout the Movie. I particularly liked Director\u000aDarabont's wish to show us as much of the Prison as he can with wide shots\u000aadding another dimension to his work, and enjoyed also his ability to hold\u000aus all in suspense until the final scenes of the film when we see Dufresne\u000afinally gain his freedom with more than a little help from two lovely\u000aladies, Rita Hayworth and Marilyn Monroe and, of course.....his rock hammer.\u000aAs always in Prison Movies full of good guys wrongly convicted or otherwise,\u000athere always seems to be a sadistic Warden or Captain of the Guards in the\u000avicinity, eager to show just who is the boss, the end of a baton, or the\u000adoor to solitary. Behind the Boss's door however was the biggest crook in\u000athe place.....Warden Norton. Bob Gunton does well portraying the twisted\u000achief of Shawshank, it was a meaty role and, as it deserves gives great\u000acredence to a pivotal character. The Shawshank Redemption is a tremendous\u000aMovie, following a long line of films made about men behind bars....... this\u000ais the best one.\u000a

V\u000a\u000a"Fear can hold you prisoner, hope can set you free."\u000aThe Shawshank Redemption is the very touching story of a man who makes\u000amistakes with his life and is imprisioned.  While there, Andy (Tim Robbins)\u000ais faced with some very cruel people, including Byron Hadley(Clancy Brown)\u000aand a group of inmates called "the sisters".  But he also meets a man named\u000aEllis Redding (played by the oh so talented Morgan Freeman) and forms a\u000aheart warming friendship.  Basically, Andy Dufresne goes through many life\u000atrials which will chill your blood, make your heart race, bring a tear to\u000ayour eye, and a smile to your lip. Wonderful movie, my all time favorite.\u000aThis is also based on the short story "Rita Hayworth and the Shawshank\u000aRedemption" written by my favorite author, Stephen King.This movie also has MANY wonderful monologues and great quotes.Please watch, and I am sure you will enjoy.\u000a"Get busy livin', or get busy dyin'."\u000a~~ML\u000a

V\u000a\u000aTHE SHAWSHANK REDEMPTION has recently been one of the many movies to be\u000aoverplayed on a network owned by Ted Turner. This is ironic because this was\u000aa box office disappointment. How come no one saw this in theaters? Probably\u000abecause there's virtually no women. And an R-rated movie with no women means\u000ano naked breasts to the guys in America.But after useless Oscar nominations and a strong audience on video,\u000aSHAWSHANK is now considered an agreeably entertaining and moving prison\u000aclassic. Morgan Freeman and Tim Robbins are perfectly cast together, probably because\u000athey are similar kinds of actors. They shine very well when the are\u000aside-by-side with another respectable actor. Look at Freeman co-star with\u000aJessica Tandy, Brad Pitt, Denzel Washington, or Kevin Costner. Seem him hold\u000ahis own in LEAN ON ME or DEEP IMPACT. Look at Robbins co-star with Susan\u000aSarandon, Jeff Bridges, Robin Williams, or Martin Lawerence. See him hold\u000ahis own in JACOB'S LADDER or THE PLAYER (among other great Altman movies).\u000aBut what really makes the two relate is the fact that they are fine actors\u000athat have proved themselves in fine movies, yet we overlook them when we\u000aname living actors who we admire.If you haven't seen this film yet, you will admire the crafty ending as well\u000aas the story or ultimately, the whole movie. The characters are strongly structured and are never overshadowed by Robbins\u000aor Freeman, though those are the two to look at.The only flaw that I find irritating in this film is the mysterious\u000adisappearance of William Sadler's stutter. Did it escape\u000aprison?I have yet to see if THE GREEN MILE surpasses this beaut of cinematic\u000astorytelling, but even if it does, this is a movie to be\u000aremembered.\u000a

V\u000a\u000aA lot of The Shawshank Redemption points to one theme, never give up. We\u000ahave a hero, will played by Tim Robbins, pitted against corrupt prison\u000aguards and an evil warden. We wonder how he will survive the oppressive\u000aprison system and the cruel inmates. This is pretty standard but what makes\u000aShawshank special is the connection between the Robbins character and\u000aanother inmate in the prison played by Morgan Freeman who also narrates much\u000aof the film. The relationship between these two is one of discovery not only\u000aof inner strength but also how strong a friendship can be.Much of The Shawshank Redemption is mood and emotion. We feel terror, heat,\u000aboredom and anger. Every aspect of the movie is a quality piece of work to\u000adrive home the feelings of the story. The entire cast is very good in how\u000athey fit into this closed often horrible world. Along with this praise comes some criticism. In the middle of Shawshank I\u000athought that the pace was too slow. I know we are supposed to see bored\u000ainmates but boring the viewer isn't the way to go. I won't give away the\u000aending but it has a fantasy quality about it that just doesn't fit the very\u000areal nature of most of the movie. It's a Hollywood ending tacked on to a\u000amore serious film. The Shawshank Redemption is a quality effort and is a welcome change from\u000athe routine action, horror or romance junk food films that are mostly\u000areleased today. It takes a hard view of life but also shows the unbending\u000awill of the human spirit.  \u000a\u000a

V\u000a\u000a     "The Shawshank Redemption" is one of my all time favorite movies. It\u000atells the story about one man's journey through prison and his struggle to\u000afind a purpose in his life, in prison he meets a new good friend , Andy\u000aDufresne, a man wrongfully accused of viciously murdering his wife.     In a way this movie is two movies rapped up into one. It not only tells\u000athe unfortunate story of a normal man in prison, and what he does there. But\u000ait also is about a man rightfully accused of murder, and does his time in\u000aprison, we find he only committed this crime as a young, stupid kid, and is\u000afull of regret, he has become wise in prison and becomes rehabilitated for\u000anormal life, he is no longer a danger to society.      His struggle to be free and search for meaning in his life is his main\u000apassion. He is convinced that hope can destroy a man, hope is not a good\u000athing. While Andy believes that hope is the only friend one can have in\u000aprison, in solitary, hope is the only way out. Andy acts as Red's mentor and\u000aguides him to the right way of thinking. This all leads up to Andy's need of\u000aRed, and finally one of the most moving endings in movie history.     Tim Robbins is excellent in the movie. He gives the performance of his\u000alife and plays Andy Dufresne to perfection. Morgan Freeman is also very\u000agood. It shows the ups and downs in Red's life, and the way of life for a\u000aprison inmate. While also showing the meaning of hope and how hope can keep\u000aa man's faith, and as a result, himself, alive. Don't miss this, you really\u000aneed to see this movie several times to completely appreciate it. But even\u000aseeing it once is heart-warming enough.\u000a

V\u000a\u000a                "Friendship or Prison" FilmI work in one of the last "Mom & Pop" Video stores in southern Florida.\u000aWithout the restrictions of a Blockbuster-like corporation job\u000aexpectentcies, I'm able to discuss anything I want with anyone - for however\u000along it takes. A few months ago I had a customer inquire about the film; I\u000aknew right off the bat he had "doubts" about the quality of the film. I got\u000ait for him, and gave him a rundown of the plot when he asked me my "No BS"\u000aopinion on the film. I just wish this guy knew I don't lie to anybody about\u000athis film.\u000aWe must have sat down for two hours: I just listened, subjectively, while he\u000acame up with some question or comment that a friend or relative had brought\u000ato his attention - giving him the impression the film was "sketchy." In the\u000aend, it simply turned out to be a question of whether or not it's a prison\u000afilm or a friendship film. How do you weigh it? The setting is constant, but\u000athe characters are defined so well it's blinding. I only mention the\u000aincident with the customer since it made me realize which road the film\u000areally fits down best. "The Shawshank Redemption," in the tradition of\u000aclassic friendship characters such as R.P MacMurphy & Chief, Ratzo Rizzo &\u000aJoe Buck, Butch Cassidy & Sundance has its two main characters (Andy\u000aDufrense & 'Red') as two guys tied into a friendship from *circumstance*\u000a(meaning prison).\u000aAs the years pass and they can only see the world from a single point of\u000aview (behind the walls of Shawshank), they begin understand each other more\u000aand more on a spiritual level. Yes, it does start as a prison film, but\u000aeventually turns to a buddy/friendship film. With Andy and Red's friendship\u000agrowing, the walls of Shawshank disappear - you can even notice there are\u000aalmost no wide angle exterior shots after the first 45 minutes. The\u000aclaustraphobia of the cells and the solitary cells are pretty harsh, yeah,\u000abut I take that as a metaphor for the restrictions the characters are unable\u000ato release; they're own ideas, beliefs and thoughts are also\u000aprisoners.\u000aI only discuss the conflict question of "prison film or buddy film" just to\u000aset something straight. The last time I saw the movie, I realized: "Does\u000aanyone watching it remember they were prisoners? Does anyone *see* the walls\u000aof Shawshank?" I think it was too difficult, with the Royal blue of the Gulf\u000aand the white powder of the beach, it's almost as if there's no trace of a\u000adark, cold, and unfriendly prison anywhere in the film prior to that\u000amoment.\u000aAndy sees his friend, knowing exactly the reason for his arrival. After\u000athat, they know whatever lies ahead in life that could be challenging or\u000adifficult won't be anymore. It's a simple safety in numbers, "you watch my\u000aback, I'll watch yours." - very close to Joe Buck & Ratso from "Midnight\u000aCowboy."chrisjohn\u000aemail to: oneofthree78@aol.com\u000a

V\u000a\u000aI would be hard pressed to name my favourite film of all time.I'd find it\u000adifficult to name my top five films of all time.\u000aBut any discussion on the topic(at least one conducted by people with an\u000aounce of sense)would surely include this film.\u000aTwo-and-a-half hours of intelligent moviemaking pass in a instant,and not\u000aonce does it let you lose interest,be it because your'e laughing at a bunch\u000aof prisoners sitting drinking beer paid for by a hard-ass warden,or crying\u000aat Andy Dufresne getting raped by a big bull queer.\u000aThe film is at times harsh and unforgiving,(the nameless inmate getting\u000abeaten to death comes at you virtualy straight away)but the over riding\u000afeeling is that of hope."Hope is a good thing,maybe the best of things".That\u000asentence will appear on every trailer,poster and teaser that you'll ever see\u000afor Shawshank,because its the whole damn point.Hope is what makes us\u000afree,what drives us to carry on.I dont want to get too philosophical,but\u000a"The Shawshank Redemption"is poetry on celluloid,a more majestic piece of\u000amoviemaking doesnt exist outside of David Lean.\u000aThe fact that Tim Robbins And Morgan Freeman were denied Oscars is\u000ascandalous,as I doubt that Robbins will ever give a performance as good as\u000athis one again(except for Cadillac Man,hes never been better)and Freeman\u000aproves once again that age leads to experience,and damn fine\u000aacting.\u000a"The Shawshank Redemption" finally gives me the oppurtunity to use the word\u000a"poignant"in a review,so I'll do so.\u000aPoignant.Indeed.\u000a

This\u000afilm gets bigger every time you watch it. I have watched this movie more\u000athan 10 times. And my opinion is that this is the greatest movie ever made,\u000aand that you have to go and see it. NOW!\u000a

V\u000a\u000ait is great to see that this movie is in the top 5. this is where it\u000abelongs.  one of the greatest movies of all time.  what made it great was\u000athey showed how two had struggles of their own in prison.  one wanted to\u000aget\u000aout, and does after 19 years,  and the other makes parole as an old man and\u000aalmost feels he serves no purpose in the outside world and feels that jail\u000ais where he belongs.  this is one of my most favorite movies and its hard\u000atoo see how some didn't like it\u000a10/10\u000a

V\u000a\u000aI didn´t expect much from this film before I saw it. It had OK stars, the\u000aplot sounded pretty familiar and it was originally a Stephen King story.\u000aOnce I started watching it I thought: "Hey! This is pretty good!". And it\u000agot better as it went along. The story was was a perfect mix of high drama\u000aand "feelgood" quality. It didn´t matter it was long and the story went\u000aalong slowly. It was all build-up for the amazing ending which caught me by\u000asurprise. Somehow the film has a sense of being more than it seems at\u000afirst,\u000ait´s really an epic story of one man´s determination against the system (or\u000aeven his given destiny!). If you´ve never seen this film, go see it -you\u000awon´t be disappointed! \u000a

V\u000a\u000aVery rarely does a movie come along that inspires people to hold on to\u000atheir\u000afaintest hopes.  'The Shawshank Redemption' is just such a movie.  Have you\u000aever felt like all hope was lost?  Tim Robbins plays a wrongfully convicted\u000aman who very easily could have let his hopes die, but instead decides to\u000apatiently plot his escape to freedom.  Excellent performances make this\u000amovie an incredible can't miss.\u000a

I have been a fan of the story by Stephen King\u000aever since I read it in high school.  When I heard that Frank Darabont, who\u000aalso directed a short King film (The Woman in the Room) in 1983, would be\u000awriting the screenplay and directing I was ecstatic.  This film could not\u000ahave been adapted better by Kubrick or King himself.  Can't wait for The\u000aGreen Mile, Frank.\u000a

V\u000a\u000aThe makers of this film have proved that in the last 20 years the true\u000ameaning of film has not been lost. This film was terrifc. It was amazing. It\u000awas the best script I ever heard. A true master-piece. The acting was great.\u000aThe film involved so much. Anger, hate, love, friendship, hope, sadness,\u000ahappiness, freedom and it dealt with all emotions. It was truely a\u000amagnificent motion picture. The film gives off true feelings of life. True\u000aemotions. The sadness and loneliness in life.The film tells you that hope is not sometime that is good and this is so\u000atrue. The script tells you another part of life. It has a happy ending but\u000ait goes through all the parts of life. It is a movie based on life. It is\u000aall about life. To be free.The story is a man who is wrongly accused for a crime he did not commit and\u000asent to jail where he meets a man who guides and helps him along the way.I give this film 10 OUT OF 10. It is absolutley brilliant.\u000a

V\u000a\u000aI dont really think anyone can put into words the greatness of this movie.\u000aThis is a movie that truly makes you feel for the characters. No special\u000aeffects, no action scenes, no big budgets, no dance floor soundtrack.  This\u000amovie is sheer genius.So many prison movies have been made before but you never get a hint of a\u000afeeling of how is must really feel like to be jailed for life.  This movie\u000agot me well and truly depressed.  I really felt for the characters of Andy\u000aand Red.  Two decent human beings with a true friendship, stuck in jail\u000awatching their lives go by within the inescapable prison walls.  The\u000aprojection of the prison, its guardians and its system was superb.  You\u000arealise that the prison is a world of its own, and with time, in order to\u000asurvive you have to learn to accept that world and forget about the outside,\u000aor do you?  This movie in a way tests you.  'Hope is a good thing, maybe the\u000abest of things' says Red at the end.  But near the end, I found myself\u000alosing hope altogether.  I felt that this movie would end with Red and\u000apossibly Andy dying in prison.  I do not get at all emotional when watching\u000aa movie, but the closing scene brought tears to my eyes and a lump in my\u000athroat, and I still get choked at that scene everytime I watch it.  The\u000ascene and narration with Brooks in the half-way house is also very powerful.The discussion between Andy and Red after Andy's time in solitary is\u000aspell-binding. Some scenes are shocking.  By the way I have probably seen\u000athis movie 30-40 or so times and still watch it.The music (especially when Andy arrives at Shawshank in the prison bus shown\u000ain an overhead shot, simply beautiful!!), the story, the direction, the\u000aacting, the cinematography, the characterisation.  I honestly cannot fault\u000athis movie and I think it is simply criminal that this movie did not win any\u000aOscars.  I think that by comparison, Forrest Gump was a load of rediculous\u000amindless trash.  I just could not understand what the fuss was about with\u000aForrest Gump.  But thats another story.  Another example of Big Budget\u000anonsense over-shadowing good quality movies.  The Shawshank Redemption is in\u000aa league of its own and Tim Robbins deserved an Oscar for best actor as did\u000aMorgan Freeman for supporting actor in his portrayal of\u000aRed.This movie is also an eye opener for so called 'expert critics'.  Just go\u000aback and see the initial reviews this movie got when it was first released.\u000aI personally never go on what these critics have to say and movies like The\u000aShawshank Redemption remind me why.  No wonder they're always giving 'two\u000athumbs up' for every half baked movie that comes along.  They're probably\u000aall thumbs and no fingers.The Shawshank Redemption is my all time favourite and I'll give this movie\u000atwo thumbs + eight fingers = 10 out of 10\u000a

V\u000a\u000a   Interesting study of wrongly-convicted Robbins sent to jail and abused by\u000aevil warden and (initially) fellow prisoners.  As film develops, Robbins\u000aturns tables on everyone.  Understated  performance by the lead; Morgan\u000aFreeman, as a fellow prisoner, actually drives this flick.  Didn't see where\u000athis differed from half a dozen other good prison movies, but that's why\u000athey make all those flavors.  Very satisfying resolution.\u000a

I have to\u000aadmit, that I hated the few violence scenes and the shooting, but in this\u000amovie it was necessary to convey the message of hope. Although I think that\u000athis is a wonderful, touching movie, I think it's also a fairy tale.\u000aEverything that happens to the main character is an exception, rather than a\u000arule which weakens the movie. Other than that, it's a marvelous story about friendship, survival and hope.\u000aWatch and see for yourself how a person survives hell on earth.\u000a\u000a

V\u000a\u000aTim Robbins (I.Q.) "Andy Dufresne" accused and convicted of the murder of\u000ahis wife, is sent a prison called Shawshank. Morgan Freeman (Driving Miss\u000aDaisy) "Red" is also in prison and he can get things from the outside world.\u000aBecause of that, they become best friends. This movie is full of hope.  It\u000ahas such sweet moments in such a terrible place as a jail.  I have never\u000awatched a movie about a jail that is as positive as this one. It is the best\u000amovie on the subject. It has great dialogue, gives the audience the sense of\u000aconstant cheering for Andy because he is so ingenious. The little glasses\u000afit the character. Andy is brilliant indeed.  I applauded him for things\u000athat he did, which are also my favorite scenes: the idea of walking around\u000athe jail yard and the discharging of the powder that he made out of the jail\u000awall, was just remarkable;  the big posters such as one of  Rita Hayworth\u000alater Rachel Welch,  on the wall;  the creation of the library;  the\u000atransfer of bank funds;  getting that hypocrite jail warden caught;  leaving\u000aclues for Red after he was paroled. Very few things in life are better than\u000ameeting your best friend by the blue waters of the ocean. I love the ending.\u000aThis movie is part of our video library and I have watched it several times\u000aand I still get hyper about the stuff that Andy does. \u000aFavorite Quote: Red: "Geology is the study of pressure and time that is all\u000ait really,  pressure and time." \u000a

Stephen King created one of the\u000amost poignant tales of hope in a modern era, Frank Darabont made every scene\u000abreathtakingly beautiful, and the cast was superb.Shawshank definitely has the most satisfying ending in all of movie history.\u000aAlthough your first watch is the greatest, every viewing reveals a different\u000alayer of the story. You begin to see prison through the eyes of Red, Brooks,\u000aHaywood, Tommy - even Warden Norton and Byron Hadley.It is my favorite movie and it has some of the most inspirational lines in\u000ait.

V\u000a\u000astory was excellent. i like it when i can relate to a man who is in\u000aprison--even though i haven't been to one. my guess is the author's\u000aconnected me through human emotions and the basic human condition to his\u000acharacters. acting left nothing to be desired.i particularly appreciated symbology of the film: cigarettes were money,\u000aperverted sex was the norm, corruption from the top down, where's my life\u000agoing? it doesn't sound like a prison film necessarily.\u000a\u000a

Little was\u000aI to know that it was to become my favorite movie of all\u000atime.\u000aFrom the very beginning shot of the prison, to the last shot of the beach\u000ain\u000aMexico, the movie had me in every emotion possible. Fear, joy, laughter,\u000asadness, despair and hope.\u000aThe acting was great, Freeman was robbed for not getting a deserved Oscar\u000afor this movie.\u000aIt is one of those rare movies which you can sit down to over and over\u000aagain.\u000a

V\u000a\u000aYears ago I decided to start collecting Stephen King paperback editions (and\u000areading them, too) to prop up my excellent English. I'd found out that in\u000athe horror genre, everything that had something to do, had the label\u000a'Stephen King' or 'John Carpenter' on it. Luckily both (as in 'Cat's Eye).\u000aBut as I introduced myself with Mr. King's works I found out that the\u000aEnchantment in it isn't in the gore (which he describes splendidly, meaning\u000athat I can smell the rottening human flesh despite the fact that my nose\u000aexists only for cosmetical reasons) but the professional skill to tell a\u000astory. King gets paid by the page, so nowadays he's apt to write stories up\u000ato three bricks thick before his eyes wear out. \u000aLuckily, his best stories to be filmed are the ones that don't need\u000a'overwriting',nor 'overfilming' as in mini-TV-series as 'The Stand', 'Golden\u000aYears', and so on. \u000aThe best way for Stephen King to make an original story for a movie seems to\u000abe to: 1) keep it compact and 2) stay out of intestines, awkward smells and\u000aanything that comes out of your body when you're dead).\u000aWe saw 'Stand by me me' already and 'Dolores Claiborne' afterwards, but this\u000ais the upmost number one. When King tells a little story in size of a\u000anovelette with no hurry at all, there should be nothing to add. But: then\u000acomes the movie with its more than perfect casting plus the original\u000aserenity maintained! \u000aI conclude my speech with saying that no other movie ever has collected full\u000a10 points, horror or not.\u000a

V\u000a\u000aThe Shawshank Redemption is a movie that many people can relate to,\u000aespecially if you had to overcome an unexpected experience that left you\u000ainstitutionalized and scarred.  People are not institutionalized only in\u000aprisons and hospitals, but in schools, colleges, broken families, society,\u000aand other organizations.  Trying to liberate ourselves from our\u000aconservative\u000apast or beliefs is not an easy process.The Shawshank Redemption is one movie that can help start that process.\u000aIt's a movie that can be watched repeatedly and after each time, even the\u000amost savvy critic may be enlightened by the depth and development of the\u000acharacters, the smooth yet scintillating story line, the reoccuring\u000asymbolic\u000athemes, the uninhibited realism, the scenes and music ranging from the\u000acold\u000agothic prison architecture to the oak tree from a Robert Frost poem, and\u000amany uninvited personal insights we hold dearly and secretly to ourselves.\u000aWatching the movie over and over again is similar to a religious baptism\u000awhere your past sins and crimes are washed away by the never-ending hope\u000athat you'll be free to achieve your highest dreams.  I'm not going to\u000areiterate the plot, dialogue, and other highlights of the film.  The movie\u000aspeaks for itself.The plethora of movies in this time makes it difficult to dig and find the\u000avery few movies that exuberate the same effect as the Shawshank\u000aRedemption.\u000aThe purpose of these reviews (also under Leonardo (24601-6) and Leonardo)\u000ais\u000ato express my tastes and to invite anyone with similar opinions to\u000arecommend\u000amovies on the same caliber.It is my all-time personal favorite movie--the only one I would give a\u000a10/10.  \u000a

Mr. Darabont\u000adid a beautiful job of directing, I'm anxiously awaiting "The Green Mile"\u000anow.  The little scenes are what makes it beautiful.  Andy on the roof with\u000ahis smile and the aerial shot of the prison while the music is playing.  I\u000adon't want to spoil anything, but the quotes are what will stay with you. \u000aAfter seeing this film (way too many times according to those around me),\u000aI've adopted my particular philosophy from it.

V\u000a\u000aMy story is like a lot of yours.  My brother and father wanted to rent this\u000amovie at the video store, and that alone made me wary, plus in my teenage\u000amind I was thinking "What?  I've never even heard of this movie!"  But after\u000awatching it I went to the store the very day it was released for home video\u000aand bought it.Everytime I see this movie, it makes everything inside of me ache.  I mean\u000atruly ache.  From the very first scene I was hooked, and in each line of\u000adialogue I experienced everything from tension, laughter, shock.  It has a\u000aquiet aura about it, a heavy mood that is not necessarily somber, but\u000ainstead incredibly profound.I used the opera scene in my media class to demonstrate the core ideas of\u000athis movie and the entire class was transfixed.  I think my favorite scene\u000ais Red and Andy talking after Andy's extensive time in "the hole".  What\u000athey discussed: hope, freedom, his wife; it makes me want to\u000acry.Please don't let anything stop you from seeing this movie.  It is for a\u000ateenage girl as much as it is for anyone.  If it doesn't affect you, I'm not\u000asure what will...\u000a

V\u000a\u000aAlthough I'm a big fan of Stephen King, nearly all of his\u000amovie adaptions just suck. There are two reasons for this:\u000a1. A lot of directors which made adaption of King's stories\u000a   are just inept.2. Because King is such a great storyteller, it is extremely\u000a   difficult to bring the story to celluloid.But The Shawshank Redemption is one of the exceptions that\u000aproves the rule (Kubrick's The Shining is another one):\u000ait is relatively true to the original story ("Rita Hayworth\u000aand\u000athe Shawshank Redemption") and most of the characters are\u000abeautifully portrayed.King has proven to a lot of his critics that he is definitely\u000anot solely a horror writer and that he is a anything but\u000aa\u000awriter of cheap trash - some critics seem to make the assumption\u000athat horror is equivalent with trash.9 of 10Regards,\u000aMark\u000a

The story is perfect , its also honest. Morgan and Tim made the\u000abest pair of cons. And Bob Gunton and Clancy Brown made the best "bad"\u000aenforcement duo.Complete 10/10 and a great movie for any collection.Although if something\u000alike a guy getting his head beat in by a night stick or some guy crawling\u000athrough a sewage pipe up to his chin in crap , if stuff like that makes you\u000aa little sick , Id suggest pop a gravol and tuff it out princess its not\u000athat bad.\u000a

Congratulations to all those who\u000awere a part of the making of this film, and to all those who have the soul\u000ato understand it.  Old souls will love the film.

V\u000a\u000aWithout a doubt, The Shawshank Redemption is one of the absolute best movies\u000athat I have ever seen.  Seeing a movie with characters that seem so true to\u000alife that I could actually care for them was a rare and very welcome\u000aexperience for me.  The film was made in such a way that you didn't really\u000aknow how it was going to end, but what an ending indeed.  I thought it was\u000aone of the most rewarding endings to a movie in recent\u000ahistory.\u000aI don't know how this movie was passed up for an Academy Award for best\u000apicture, or at least a nomination, amazes me.  Well deserving of its rank of\u000a#4 in the top 250 movies of all time.\u000a

V\u000a\u000aFirst time I saw this, I was blown away. Second time, I was amazed even\u000amore. The movie sucks you in and doesn't let you till the awesome end.\u000aMorgan Freeman gives one of the best performances I have ever seen as well\u000aas Tim Robbins, and the rest of the stellar cast. Hard to believe Morgan\u000astarted his big screen career 12 years ago. I think if he started acting in\u000aHollywood when he was 20 instead of 50, he would have quite a few Oscars\u000aunder his belt.Why does this film get better and better? Probably because you can find new\u000athings in each viewing. Knowing what will happen allows you to look around\u000aand check out the surroundings. You can see little things that contribute to\u000aunderstanding the story better.SPOILER ALERT!The best part? The very end when Andy Dufresne escapes and shows that with\u000adetermination, that a person can do anything they want including getting\u000aaway from a prison after digging a hole in the wall for 19\u000ayears.SPOILER END!Overall, this movie is one of the best of all time. Now I will go back to\u000aanticipating The Green Mile with Frank Darabont directing and starring Tom\u000aHanks.\u000a

V\u000a\u000a  I don't think this film is the number one of all time.  But than, it might\u000abe.  I placed Casblanca and The Godfather higher because they haven't dated.\u000a Let's see how well the Shawshank Redemption does in twenty\u000ayears.  That said, this movie is a staggering experience.  While I didn't\u000aexperience it in theatres, I was impressed by the cinematography.  The\u000aperformances are uniformly flawless.  I can't believe that Hawthorne beat\u000aout Robbins to a nomination.  The direction and story also make this\u000amagnificent.  But what makes it moving, is it's theme.  In the end, it's\u000aabout hope.  Not an 'action' quality, but an important one.  It doesn't\u000apreach, but teaches.  The music score still haunts me.  I rank it as number one of 1994, and one of the best of the\u000adecade.\u000a

V\u000a\u000aStephen King's original story 'Rita Hayworth and the Shawshank Redemption'\u000ahas long been one of my favourites, and when I heard it was getting the\u000aHollywood treatment I was suspicious (after all, Stephen King's Hollywood\u000atrack record isn't exactly outstanding). Then I heard Morgan Freeman was\u000ainvolved, and thought, 'Sounds good!' I was living in England when the film\u000awas released, so had to wait until several weeks after the U.S. opening\u000abefore I saw it. I took my husband along with me: he's not a huge King fan,\u000aand I think that the prospect of a two-hour-plus prison film based on a\u000aStephen King story wasn't hugely appealing: but we both came out realising\u000awe had seen a truly great film. Strangely, British movie critics (on the\u000awhole) gave the film a much better reception than did the American ones, and\u000aright from the start SHAWSHANK has been more highly thought of there: the\u000aBritish film magazine EMPIRE has recognised its quality from the start, and\u000ain its recent tenth anniversary issue picked it as one of the ten best films\u000aof the 1990s (with detailed reasons). To me it's one of the ten best films\u000aI've ever seen: it's one that repays multiple viewings, and the two central\u000aperformances are outstanding. I'm now eagerly awaiting the film's DVD\u000arelease. \u000a

V\u000a\u000aFrom the same book that brought us Stand By Me and Apt Pupil comes The\u000aShawshank Redemption. If you haven't read this book (Different Seasons),\u000ayou'd better go buy it. And if you haven't seen Apt Pupil (very underrated\u000amovie) go rent it.A couple things about this movie. Morgan Freeman is one of the best out\u000athere. When I read the novella, 'Rita Hayworth and Shawshank Redemption' I\u000ahad never thought that Red was a black man. Maybe he wasn't which just goes\u000ato show what a great story and movie this was. IT DIDN'T and IT DOESN'T\u000aMATTER that he's black or not. The other thing was that I kind of wish I\u000aHADN'T read the story first. Knowing how it was going to end spoiled it a\u000alittle, not too much because the girl I saw it with was 100% totally\u000asurprised when the hole in the wall was discovered. So at least I had that\u000aprior knowledge over her. haha!Even though I gave this movie a 10 out of 10 here at IMDb, I'm surprised\u000ait's doing battle with The Godfather and Schindler's List for the #1\u000aposition here.\u000a

I'm simply a young woman\u000aand\u000anothing more. I've never been unjustly accused of a crime and/or thrown\u000ainto\u000aprison.

V\u000a\u000aI remember when this movie came out.  It seemed like a ridiculous title,\u000aand\u000aI was more into Forrest Gump then  spending any hard earned money on this\u000amovie.  At the local multiplex, my date coerced me into going anyway, and\u000ait\u000awas one of the greatest cinematic experiences of my life.  It's like the\u000afirst time you saw The Godfather, or Star Wars.  It has gradually become\u000amy\u000aall time favorite, and for two main reasons: One: to the new viewer, it\u000amay\u000aappear a rough prison movie, but what lies ahead is the enchanting tale of\u000ahope, and the enduring bond of true friendship, themes that do not appear\u000ain\u000atoo many modern films.  The second reason is that after multiple viewings,\u000ai\u000ahave yet to tire of it.  It grips me each time.  Perhaps it is the subtle\u000aintroduction, or the mesmerizing ending.

It has quickly moved to the #2 movie\u000ain my top ten list just behind Pulp Fiction.  And even though Pulp Fiction\u000ais my favorite I think Shawshank should have won best picture.  4 out of 4\u000astars, two thumbs up and all that jazz.

V\u000a\u000a"The Shawshank Redemption" deserves the title of the Most Moving Movie of\u000aAll Time.Picking a list of "The Best Movies Ever" is always a ridiculous and futile\u000apractice. A look at IMDBs top 10 shows several entirely different movies,\u000afrom "Star Wars" to "Schindler's List" and "The Godfather." The only\u000acharacteristic shared by all 10 is that they are "worth watching." So,\u000asince\u000aShawshank held the #1 slot for many months, it received plenty of ranting,\u000aillogical, completely undue criticism:* That its characters were static - Simply not true. They do become moral\u000aicons by the end of the movie, but they evolve into their\u000aparts.* That there is too much preaching/narration/"babying" - There is nothing\u000aout of place in this movie. Red doesn't labor his narration because he's\u000apedantic, he does it because he's straightforward - this isn't a college\u000aprofessor speaking - and absolutely, astoundingly beautiful. Yes, there is\u000athe panoramic shot of the azure pacific at the end - but it dovetails\u000aneatly\u000awith the story - "Something that big would scare me." (Not\u000averbatim).* That there are perhaps 15 minutes at the end of the movie in which the\u000afate of the characters is clear and 5 after questions have been resolved -\u000aThis is absolutely necessary. "The Shawshank Redemption" attempts to leave\u000athe viewer thinking about ideas, not plot twists. Though this is only ever\u000aargued on scholastic (rather than aesthetic) grounds, even Star Wars'\u000aending\u000awould have seemed abrupt without a brief, ceremonial resolution.* That its foreshadowing or narration cuts drama - missing the point. I\u000ashutter to think of this film if told entirely from the present - it would\u000aloose its beauty. There's deliberately a lot of "time passing" sequences.\u000aThe real reason this movie has its high ranking is that it grapples with\u000a"hope" - and hope, like all abstract notions, becomes concrete with\u000aintrospection, and introspection takes time. This is not a "prison escape"\u000amovie.See this movie. Think about this movie. Talk about this movie. The\u000aShawshank\u000aRedemption thinks and feels more than other works of popular cinema, and\u000ademands that viewers do the same. I almost envy anyone who hasn't seen it\u000ayet; the first viewing is absolutely magical.\u000a

V\u000a\u000aI've recently been going through my vast collection of videos, replaying\u000amy\u000afavorites in an effort to determine which is best.Without question, "Shawshank Redemption" towers above all the others, even\u000a"The Godfather," which slightly outranks it in the IMDb list of 250 best\u000amovies.I have also taken the trouble of looking up most of the reviews of the\u000amovie, and I remain puzzled at the criticism that even such respected\u000acritics as Roger Ebert gave the movie. The most prevalent criticism is\u000athat\u000athe movie is too long. I don't agree. "Shawshank" is perfectly paced.\u000aAnother criticism, that the story-line is predictable, is absurd. What\u000amakes\u000a"Shawshank" stand out from all other movies is that nothing that happens\u000ain\u000ait has ever happened in a movie before. It is sui generis, in a class by\u000aitself. If you've seen it, you'll know what I mean. If you haven't seen\u000ait,\u000adrop everything else and get ahold of it.\u000a

V\u000a\u000aI truly believe this is one of the best films I have ever seen.Slow to start, but then it grabs you totally (I Recommend going to the loo\u000abefore you start watching, as you will not be able to force yourself to\u000aturn\u000athe Vid off when you get hooked).The film is full of feeling and emotion, it gave/still gives me goose\u000abumps,\u000ain places.Sad as it may seem, I have bought the video twice, cause I am worried that\u000athe 1st one will be worn out too quickly (& I'm not joking).What can I tell you about the film, nothing much as it would ruin the many\u000abrilliant different, yet connected stories within. Except to say it is\u000aabout\u000aa man who ( In true tradition) ends up in a prison (Shawshank) yet\u000aprofesses\u000ahis innocence, and eventually be-friends a fellow black\u000ainmate.The story is narrated by the afore mentioned inmate portrayed\u000aby\u000aMorgan Freeman, who's doleful voice, and heart thought comments are so\u000abeautiful, and so suited to the film.Tim Robbins ( the new inmate ) plays his role wonderfully, and interacts\u000awith the film ( a credit to his skill ) wonderfully.If I have not convinced you to watch the film ( Which I personally have\u000aRecommended to numerous people, who all loved it) there is the music and\u000athe\u000afantastic images of the prison itself. Overwhelming in every\u000arespect.I still have a tear in my eye at the end of the film, even\u000anow.Let Me Know.I really hope you enjoy, this, so under acknowledged film.Let Me Know.\u000a

V\u000a\u000aThe only reason I rented this title was because I've seen its rating in the\u000aIMDB. Well I was hoping for a thrilling experience, a work of art at least.\u000aC'mon you raters! This is simply a good film! It's ok to watch, but if you\u000awere hoping for something better than good, then you will be disappointed.\u000aThere are so many better films than this! Now, talking about the film, Tim\u000aRobbins was not the ideal match for this role and Morgan Freeman was ok for\u000aa nice old man in a Midwest bar, but definitely not for a murder convict. In\u000ageneral the atmosphere in the jail was laughable. So many good men, you\u000awould believe it was the Sunday mass.\u000a

V\u000a\u000a"The Shawshank Redemption" is nearly poetic, but misses slightly because of\u000aits straight-forward telling.  That isn't a flaw really.  It's just that\u000aconsidering some of the powerful human emotions and grandiose spritual\u000ascenes displayed, the film could have been legendary.  Still, this film is\u000adestined to be a classic and rightfully so.  Stephen King hasn't written\u000aanother story that was better (Title "Rita Hayworth and the Shawshank\u000aRedemption" in the book "Diffrent Seasons" which also contains "The Body"\u000awhich was made into another great movie, "Stand By Me" starring River\u000aPhoenix).  Tim Robbins and especially Morgan Freeman are outstanding.  Drama\u000ararely gets muchs better than this and the solitude of human existence is\u000adepressingly displayed here.  Wonderful, wonderful!Oh yeah, Morgan Freeman's explanation for being named "Red" is probably one\u000aof the purely humorous things you'll ever hear.\u000a

V\u000a\u000aThis movie has gradually become my favorite.  After the first viewing, I was\u000ain complete awe at the way the events lead up to the final events with Andy.\u000aThe second time, I realized that the prevalent theme is hope.  The third,\u000athen the fourth, then the fifth... etc.... forever, I realized that this\u000amovie has so many elements, that a review such as this doesn't provide ample\u000aspace to discuss them all.I think that what makes this movie so unique, is its portrayal of prison\u000alife.  Most of the time, prisons are either romanticized in that they don't\u000aportray all of the harsh elements of it.  The other times, the writers try\u000atoo hard to prove how harsh a prison is.  They portray them as places where\u000athe convicts should give up hope because its Hell on Earth until you die,\u000aand everybody begs to come out as soon as the parole board gives their\u000asay-so. This movie, however, completely illustrates the harsh realities of\u000aprison, as well as a place where one learns to hate it, but then gets used\u000ato it (as Red said).  Andy made a best friend there.  Had he not gone to\u000aprison, he never would've met Red.  Besides, the prisoners (for the most\u000apart) seemed to be having a fairly good time most of the time and probably\u000acouldn't imagine being anywhere else.Stephen King also brings out an element of crime and punishment.  I find it\u000avery ironic that Andy, a fairly good man \u000ais the only one that doesn't give up hope of living on the outside.  I think\u000athat one of the most important parts of the movie is when Andy talks about\u000ahow whatever sins he has committed, has been paid for.  Andy is one of the\u000aonly ones that doesn't give up hope because he doesn't belong\u000athere.One more thing is the way that Andy brings a form of salvation to others. \u000aHe makes prison more human.  He gets the guys the beers so that they'll\u000anever forget the freedom of the outside world.  In addition, he asks for the\u000aname of the "fresh fish" in the beginning.  As proven by a later movie,\u000aSaving Private Ryan, asking what a person's name is seems to prove as a very\u000aeffective way of humanizing what is actually inhumane.There are a gajillion other themes, but I would exhaust myself trying to\u000aexplain them all.  So if the thousand of other good reviews on this page\u000adon't influence you to watch it, hopefully this will.  The acting is\u000aincredible (as a guy, its hard to imagine that a two hour plus movie without\u000aan actress is bearable).  I don't think that you can compare this movie with\u000aany others because there aren't too many movies that inundate the watcher\u000afrom the beginning with loads and loads of themes and concepts. \u000aFurthermore, its impressive the way almost every element has some\u000asignificance.  In the beginning, even the most trivial of details that evade\u000athe eye the first time become essential elements in Andy's final scene (in\u000ahope not to spoil the ending).But I must warn you.  The first time: this movie is good, the second time:\u000aits better, the third time: its addicting.  Don't say that I didn't warn\u000ayou.  Ten plus out of ten!!!  Thank you IMDB for finally putting this very\u000aunderrated movie in its rightful place. \u000a

V\u000a\u000aThe Shawshank Redemption is, without peer, the best movie of all time.\u000aAlthough it may have a somewhat limited plot ( then again which film\u000adoesn't?) it makes this up with the sequences of bizarre twists and\u000aturns.Andy Dufrene claims he was wrongly convicted of murdering his wife and her lover.\u000aThe prison he is sent to is brutal - a hypocritical\u000achurch-going warden who murders inmates for his own gain - and sodomy is\u000aprevalent. Andy's character is determined to survive through all of his\u000ahardships.The rest of the characters are so complex that to describe them would merely\u000adampen everyone elses opinion on the film. I know it was nominated for some\u000aAcademy Awards, and didn't win any, but it deserved more than\u000aTitanic!It is didactic and its main theme is hope. In fact the last few lines of the\u000afilm always bring tears to my eyes - "I hope to see my friend, and shake his\u000ahand. I hope the Pacific is as blue as it has been in my mind. I hope."\u000aThese words, uttered by Morgan Freemon are truely inspirational\u000awords.My opinion is watch this movie as often as possible, and learn from\u000ait.The Shawshank Redemption - the best movie ever!!\u000a

V\u000a\u000aI just watched Shawshank for the nth time tonight (it was on TNT), and\u000arealized why I enjoyed the movie so much: it had one of the most\u000acinematic,\u000aenthralling, and satisfying conclusion in movie history.  Not that I am\u000adismissing the great story, honest and absorbing characters, and memorable\u000ascenes (the scene where an entire field full of inmates seemingly\u000ahypnotized\u000aby Mozart's opera music comes to mind).  The ending where all of the\u000awarden's sins were conveniently exposed may sound contrived in other\u000amovies,\u000abut brilliant writing filled with dry wit carried the scene through\u000amarvelously (Red: "I'd like to think the last thing that went through the\u000awarden's head - other than the bullet - was how in hell Andy Dufresne got\u000athe best of him").  And the way the last scene was put together, where\u000aRed's\u000anarration of 'hopes' melts into a scene where his hopes comes true (when\u000ahe\u000aactually crossed the border and reunited with his old friend), was just\u000amagical.  It makes me glad that my girlfriend pushed me into watching it\u000a("But it's just a stupid prison movie!" I lamented).  How I was\u000awrong!\u000a

This\u000afilm though, has broken the wall of disinterest I've held for cheesy,\u000ahi-tech, flashy cute flicks that have littered the cinemas as of late. The\u000acharacter development, cinematography, and script for The Shawshank\u000aRedemption shine through the bleak cloud that I see surrounding Hollywood\u000athese days, as it concerns itself with special effects and big name actors\u000abent on budgets and wages. A rental that I so wish I had seen in the\u000atheaters five years ago, the camera work and display from Freeman and\u000aRobbins is a relief to view, and eye-opening connection to movies that is\u000aso\u000arare.

V\u000a\u000aThis film was great - and that's a poor way to describe it. IT was\u000afantastic!!! You see into the lives of Andy and Red and all the others in\u000aShawshank. Not only do you gain insight as to how the prisoners live, but\u000aalso how they work and live with one another, and how badly they are\u000atreated\u000aat times, by both fellow prisoners and by the guards. This movie also\u000ashows\u000ahow that in some cases instead of preparing a prisoner for life back on\u000athe\u000astreets, prison will make them prepared for life only on the inside. The\u000aexample of this is the elderly librarian prisoner. He has been in prison\u000afor\u000amany many years, and finally he is let out. This\u000amovie is a must see for anyone who likes a good prison movie or just one\u000athat seems to be real life. \u000a

V\u000a\u000aI just visited a prison museum in north China, which was a real prison used\u000ain early 1900s.  This movie reminds me of horrible dark room, sodomy, and\u000abrutal corporal punishment that actually can happen to you in the jail.Whether you are innocent or not, once you are IN the jail. You are all the\u000asame. Your are finished. But, Andy Dufresne(Tim Robbins) is not. With hope\u000aand his persistence, he escaped from jail after 20 years. Imagine to dig a\u000abig cement hole with the small stone hatchet! Amazing.Where there is a will, there is a way. This movie is encouraging.\u000a

V\u000a\u000aI'm afraid that I must join the chorus of those that question the\u000aplacement\u000aof this movie at the top of the rankings. Although I enjoy the movie a\u000agreat\u000adeal, it is mainly because of the superb job done by the actors,\u000aespecially\u000athe leads. Without that, I don't think the movie would have amounted to\u000amuch, because the plot is relatively thin; wide swaths could have been cut\u000afrom the film and no one would have noticed. Take the library Andy built.\u000aIt\u000adid not advance the basic plot at all, as with other scenes. You could\u000aargue that it was precisely\u000athese small events that made the film good, and I would agree. But that's\u000amy\u000apoint:there wasn't really anything tying the movie together other than our\u000asympathy for the characters. While well developed characters are a central\u000apart of any good movie, there should still be something driving the action\u000aother than our sympathy for them; i.e. some sort of chain of events that\u000adrives the action independently of the characters. To everyone who thinks\u000athis is the best movie ever, I invite you to watch a couple films from the\u000atop 5 of the AFI list. You can argue about the AFI's placement all day,\u000abut\u000aall of the top 5 are better rounded films than Shawshank. If you still\u000afeel\u000aShawshank is better than the rest, more power to you.\u000a

V\u000a\u000aI'm one of those repetitive mucks who'll watch the same movie every\u000aweekend\u000afor three months or until I feel I've had enough.  Shawshank is one of\u000athose\u000afilms I have seen at least ten times and yet, it is still new.  The truth\u000ais, you're never really immune to the human drama portrayed by Tim Robbins\u000aand Morgan Freeman, both excellent here.\u000aThis is not a feel-good Friday night flick.  It's about injustice,\u000adesperation, the overcoming of that desperation, and the will to live\u000aregardless of time or circumstance.\u000aShawshank set no records at the box office and was largely ignored until\u000agradually, it was recognized as the masterpiece it undoubtedly is.  Roger\u000aEbert attributes the movie's financial flop to its unassuming name.I noticed the film is right at the top of the IMDB's Top 250 films list,\u000aand\u000arightfully so!!!  Some movies have one or two really glorious scenes.  But\u000aShawshank is one continuing memorable scene.  There is not one line of\u000astale\u000adialogue or awkwardness.  I can't do it justice here, so do yourself a\u000afavor\u000aand rent it NOW.\u000a

V\u000aThis is a rare kind of movie. A movie about the development of a\u000afriendship\u000aunder the hardest conditions.Being a huge fan of Stephen King's original novella, and considering past\u000aattempts to make his stories into movies, I was very sceptical when\u000aentering\u000athe theatre. But I have never seen an adaptation of his work which moved\u000ame\u000ain the way this one did. Director Darabont even get away with turning Red\u000ainto an African American. Actually I think the movie is superior to the\u000awritten version.The main reason for this movie's strength is the two leading characters,\u000abrilliantly brought to life by Tim Robbins, (should have been Academy\u000aAward\u000awinner) Morgan Freeman. Together with the director they make this into a\u000auniversal story and the American movie of the decade.The only drawback is the ending. In my opinion it should have ended with\u000aRed\u000agetting on the bus. In that way each of us could create the ending we\u000apreferred. Most of us would have chosen the same one as the director but\u000aas\u000ait is presented I think it is a bit over the top. And that is sad for a\u000amovie of this kind.Still, if I had to go to a deserted island bringing only one American\u000amovie\u000afrom the nineties this would be it.\u000a\u000a

V\u000a\u000aThe difference between this story about prison in the middle of the 20th\u000aCentury and any other movie is just about everything.  From the great\u000aacting\u000aof Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman to the outstanding directing, this movie\u000ajust makes the viewer feel as if they spent their time doing something\u000aworthwhile.  The ending of the movie makes the movie, but without all of\u000athe\u000aother parts leading up to the finale, there would be nothing as well.\u000aAlmost every scene in this has a point and a reason.  Watching others view\u000athis movie for the first time, I've noticed that the interest is usual\u000aonly\u000aat an average level during the first third of the film, but as the viewer\u000ais\u000adrawn in, they soon can't take their eyes off of it.  Only the best of\u000amovies will have all of these qualities, and with it being a happy,\u000asuccessful story in the end, few can deny its greatness.\u000a

V\u000a\u000aThis is a story about patience, maturity, character, salvation, and\u000aultimately about finding humanity in a place where there is none. Although\u000aits subject matter may be depressing, the story actually contains a lot of\u000awarmth, humor and friendship - a buddy story cloaked in a philosophical\u000adiscourse on the importance of retaining a sense of personal worth and hope\u000ano matter what the circumstances.This adaptation of a 1982 Stephen King novella did lukewarm box office,\u000ain part because of an advertising campaign that offered no clue as to what\u000athe movie was about, and in part because it never played on more than 970\u000ascreens. Still it garnered seven Oscar nominations, including a Best Picture\u000anod, and finished up at a respectable $30 million.Set in mid-1940s Maine, this is the story of Andy Dufresne (Tim Robbins),\u000awho is tried and falsely convicted for the murder of his wife and her lover.\u000aHe is sentenced to life at Shawshank prison, where he meets a canny lifer\u000anamed Ellis Boyd "Red" Redding (Morgan Freeman), and a caravan of colorful\u000acharacters.The story begins with Red and his fellow inmates watching the latest\u000abusload of prisoners unload, and they make bets on who will cry during their\u000afirst night in prison, and who will not. Red narrates the story from within the walls\u000aof the prison.Whereas some Stephen King adapters have seemed intent on transcending or\u000atrashing their source material, writer-director Frank Darabont succeeds\u000athrough fidelity to the text; the few deviations make this subdued male love\u000astory even more audience-friendly. The film sports elegant cinematography by\u000aRoger Deakins, a poignant score by Thomas Newman, solid portrayals and\u000acharacterizations by Morgan Freeman and Tim Robbins, and an excellent\u000asupporting cast including James Whitmore (as old-timer Brooks Hatlen) and\u000aWilliam Sadler as a con who starts out scary and ends up lovable.\u000a\u000a

V\u000a\u000aFor a simple story which can be described in two or three sentences, the\u000aemotional impact this film has is surprising. 'The Shawshank Redemption'\u000afollows the maturation of a friendship over a thirty-year period, during\u000awhich two men grow close in a cruel and brutal prison in New England. Based\u000aon a story by Stephen King, that author whose work has inspired such cheesy\u000ascreen fare such as 'Thinner' and 'Needful Things', the film comes as a\u000asurprise. I had always though Forrest Gump was a great movie until I saw\u000aShawshank. One of the strongest thoughts I had after seeing this film was\u000athat we, as a society, are wrong to sentence a man to endless years in\u000aprison. A controversial view, but it makes sense when compared to the world\u000ain the film. Hope, friendship, and an unwillingness to be broken are the\u000amain messages in a story that is beautifully filmed and flawlessly acted.\u000aTim Robbins did deserve an Academy Award much more than Tom Hanks did, and I\u000awas disappointed to see that even Morgan Freeman's excellent turn as 'Red'\u000aslipped by Academy voters. Ah well, it's the same awards panel that gave\u000athe Best Picture nod to 'Titanic'. The world does not always make sense,\u000a'Shawshank' teaches us. Bad things happen to good people, and it's who you\u000aare after the storm has passed that show us who, and what, we are.\u000a\u000a

V\u000a\u000aHope. It´s obviously "the" word that defines this movie.

The first two thirds\u000aof the movie started making perfect sense. Then it takes another turn,\u000aperfectly underlined by Morgan Freeman's marvellously confused expression\u000abeing questioned by the warden.

After I\u000aheard the coming adaptation in 1994, I thought to myself "It's gonna be a\u000acliche prison movie". But when I first watched it on the big screen, I was\u000atotally shocked. I think they made a great favor to Forrest Gump and Tom\u000aHanks that year. The 6 academy awards was meant to be for this film. I still\u000aget the same excitement while watching this one over and over again. Now I'm\u000awaiting for the DVD version for the  film.

(Check out Different Seasons which also has The Body (Stand By\u000aMe) and Apt Pupil.    The movie follows the short story well with a few\u000aembellishments. Good casting, though i think tim robbins might have been an\u000aalternate choice.  star quality deliveries by morgan freeman and bob gunton.\u000ain an era when we see much garbage find its way to the screen, swhawshank\u000arepresents what movies should strive to achieve.\u000a

V\u000a\u000aThis is indeed one of the best prison dramas I've ever\u000aseen.\u000aI've always been a fan of Tim Robbins and he doesn't let me down here. But I\u000acan't believe this is so high in the overall list (I would place it in the\u000a150-200 range myself). Even if we just stick with Tim Robbins, 'The Player',\u000a'Short Cuts' and 'Jacob's Ladder' are all far better films. It was the\u000aending of the film that really disappointed me, but since I'm not allowed to\u000atalk about endings in these reviews I can't explain why! Suffice it to say\u000athat I can imagine at least two fairly obvious endings that would have been\u000abetter. Maybe it's the 'American Factor', what with me being English, but\u000athe overrating of this film completely baffles me.\u000a\u000a

V\u000a\u000aI regret that I missed seeing this one on the big screen.  Unfortunately, I\u000aavoided it because Stephen King wrote it, and I had stereo-typed it as a\u000ahorror flick.  I only decided to see it on VHS (without reading a review)\u000aafter seeing its incredibly high ranking in the IMDB Top\u000a250.In fact, this is an amazing story of inner strength and human spirit, more\u000afrom the side of King that gave us "Stand By Me" than the side responsible\u000afor "Cujo".Very deserving of the Best Picture nomination.\u000a

V\u000a\u000aIt's always difficult to choose a favourite movie out of all the movies I\u000ahave seen, but I really believe that this is the one. When I first watched\u000ait, I had not read the Stephen King novella, and had no idea what was going\u000ato happen, which made it much more enjoyable to watch. Of course, like any\u000amovie, this was not flawless, but was such a terrific emotional experience\u000afor someone who is seldom moved by cinema. This was such a cinematic\u000atriumph, and I couldn't believe that it didn't win any of its seven\u000anominations at the Oscars. The performances were wonderful, captivating the\u000amood of the film to sheer perfection. Nothing against Forrest Gump, but it\u000ashould have been easily outclassed for Best Picture. It was also a good\u000amovie, but just nowhere near as memorable as this one.\u000a

V\u000aThe Shawshank Redemption is cinematic masterpiece directed by Frank\u000aDarabont, is the movie of all movies. It has touches of many themes\u000afrom different types of genres such as drama, action, adventure, crime\u000aand mystery. We see brilliant acting from both Tim Robbins as Andy\u000aDufresne and Morgan Freeman as Ellis Boyd 'Red' Redding and we also see\u000athe amazing and in my opinion a standout in this film James Whitmore as\u000aBrooks Hatlen. Morgan Freeman narrates the movie perfectly with his soft southern tone\u000aof voice soothing to the listeners. The scenes of the movie were shot\u000abeautifully and the prison looked spectacular when panned out in a\u000ashot. The film, being an adaption of a Stephen King short story, has\u000abecome one of his best stories along with another personal favorite of\u000amine The Green Mile (1999).This is a truly touching movie and receives my highest recommendation.\u000a10 Stars!\u000a

V\u000aOne of the best films I've ever seen. Great inspiration from everyone.\u000aShows life how it was . Even when life's that bad you don't have to\u000ahave it that way. Great star Morgan Freeman . Plays a character RED\u000awhich is heart warming. There are some sad times of the feature but it\u000awouldn't be a box smash without all kinds of genre included. Such a\u000agreat script and great camera work. I love the fact Andy is a nobody\u000athen becomes the highlight of the prison for putting his foot down and\u000astepping up to the mark that everyone else was to scared to cross.\u000aGreat plot. I have seen this over double figures and still see new bits\u000aas its a lengthy film\u000a

V\u000aofficially the Republic of Lithuania (Lithuanian: Lietuvos Respublika)\u000ais a country in Northern Europe,[9] the largest of the three Baltic\u000astates. It is situated along the southeastern shore of the Baltic Sea,\u000ato the east of Sweden and Denmark. It borders Latvia to the north,\u000aBelarus to the east and south, Poland to the south, and Kaliningrad\u000aOblast (a Russian exclude) to the southwest. Lithuania has an estimated\u000apopulation of 3 million as of 2013, and its capital and largest city is\u000aVilnius. Lithuanians are a Baltic people, and the official language,\u000aLithuanian, is one of only two living languages (together with Latvian)\u000ain the Baltic branch of the Indo-European language family. For\u000acenturies, the southeastern shore of the Baltic Sea was inhabited by\u000avarious Baltic tribes. In the 1230s the Lithuanian lands were united by\u000aMindaugas, the King of Lithuania, and the first unified Lithuanian\u000astate, the Kingdom of Lithuania, was created on 6 July 1253. During the\u000a14th century, the Grand Duchy of Lithuania was the largest country in\u000aEurope: present-day Lithuania, Belarus, Ukraine, and parts of Poland\u000aand Russia were the territories of the Grand Duchy. With the Lublin\u000aUnion of 1569, Lithuania and Poland formed a voluntary two-state union,\u000athe PolishLithuanian Commonwealth. The Commonwealth lasted more than\u000atwo centuries, until neighboring countries systematically dismantled it\u000afrom 1772 to 1795, with the Russian Empire annexing most of Lithuania's\u000aterritory. As World War I neared its end, Lithuania's Act of\u000aIndependence was signed on 16 February 1918, declaring the\u000aestablishment of a sovereign State of Lithuania. Starting in 1940,\u000aLithuania was occupied first by the Soviet Union and then by Nazi\u000aGermany. As World War II neared its end in 1944 and the Germans\u000aretreated, the Soviet Union reoccupied Lithuania. On 11 March 1990, a\u000ayear before formal break-up of the Soviet Union, Lithuania became the\u000afirst Soviet republic to declare the restoration of independent State\u000aof Lithuania. Lithuania is a member of the European Union, the Council\u000aof Europe, a full member of the Schengen Agreement and NATO. It is also\u000aa member of the Nordic Investment Bank, and part of Nordic-Baltic\u000acooperation of Northern European countries. The United Nations Human\u000aDevelopment Index lists Lithuania as a "very high human development"\u000acountry. Lithuania has been among the fastest growing economies in the\u000aEuropean Union and is ranked 17th in the world in the Ease of Doing\u000aBusiness Index.\u000a

V\u000aIt is not uncommon to hire people to write reviews on social networks\u000athat should appear to be by independent contributors. That's why i had\u000ato laugh when i saw The Shawshank Redemption being the best rated movie\u000aon IMDb. But since there would be little sense in making such an effort\u000ato generate more than a million votes and almost three thousand reviews\u000afor a movie made in 1994 i assume this is genuine.In any case, based on Stephen King's novella, The Shawshank Redemption\u000awas an alright prison movie to watch. However, it displays what i see\u000aas typical for King's work. When he's writing science fiction, fantasy\u000aor horror it all sits well. But when he writes anything that should\u000amirror reality it simply feels fake in the same way as wearing a cotton\u000ashirt and the one made of synthetics feels different. The events might\u000ahave been based on actual events, but i haven't been convinced.Obviously when you make any kind of list, there will always be a first\u000aplace. On IMDb it is currently being taken by The Shawshank Redemption.\u000a

After hearing so\u000amany great reviews from friends and relatives alike, I've finally\u000adecided to watch it. I love it.The story is amazing the main character Andrew is a pure genius. He\u000amanages to build a library in the prison, do taxes for prisoners,\u000aguards, and warden alike, comes with perfect escape plan, and exploits\u000aWarden's corruption, fakes his identity, and finally gives a gift to\u000ahis friend Red.I thought the performance were amazing too. Morgan Freeman is just\u000aamazing at every act he does. Other actors were pretty damn good as\u000awellwell-deserving 10 out of 10\u000a

V\u000aThis film, if it isn't one of the greatest of all time, at least I can\u000asay it is one of the greatest I've ever seen. This is a must-recommend,\u000abecause to be honest, this is one of the many movies a movie lover must\u000asee before they die. It is not just a great film, but a great\u000aexperience. And it is quite the experience! Morgan Freeman gives the\u000aperformance of his career in this film. I give props to the director\u000afor making him narrate the film as well. He is just that great. Tim\u000aRobbins give a very underrated performance in this film. Freeman stole\u000athe show, but there was a certain subtlety of Robbins' that can't go\u000awithout being recognized. Either way, both these men give their full\u000aeffort into this film. There is a great atmosphere around this film as\u000awell, it's a subtle tone, as this is a subtle, (But great) film, but it\u000achanges when it needs to change, and it knows exactly when. As a\u000amatter-of-fact, what makes this movie great is that it knows exactly\u000awhen it needs to do something powerful, thoughtful or sentimental, and\u000ato be honest as a moviegoer, that is all I can ask for.\u000a

V\u000aI was born in the 90's so I did not grow up watching The Shawshank\u000aRedemption. 2 years ago or so I decided to watch it. I was blown away.\u000aIt moved me in a way that few other movies have. It is a masterpiece.\u000aImagine if your life was taken away from you and all you had was your\u000athoughts about what you did, what you have done, or what you were going\u000ato do. Wouldn't it drive you nuts, wouldn't it make you want to give up\u000ahope in life. That is the key word in this film, "hope". When Andy\u000asuffers during that whole time he is at Shawshank prison, you feel for\u000ahim yet you keep thinking that it will end bad for him and his friend\u000aRed. As their relationship grows, Andy's plan to escape grows and soon\u000ahe fines hope that he will escape that God awful place, and then he\u000adoes and you cant help but to ball your eyes out after realizing what\u000athis man had to do to reach his goal. And then the last scene with Andy\u000aand Red symbolizes that this film is for the weak who strive to be\u000astrong. The writing, acting, directing, cinematography all make this\u000aone of the greatest films of all time.\u000a

V\u000aNot that I have been known to admire the critical pieces of work in\u000aHollywood/Bollywood (I would have aliens and zombies any day); I did\u000alove the cinematic motif called the 'The Shawshank Redemption'. Much\u000ahas been already written about the movie and most of it would\u000adefinitely have been more effusive, more spirited, more detailed than\u000awhat I am about to write. But one more good review won't do it no bad,\u000aand I promise to be - to the point if not short, so that you would by\u000anow have determinedly made your mind to watch it. Well, what can I say,\u000ait is based on a novella written by Stephen King, a prolific writer\u000asuffering from highly activated carbon of imagination and a severe bout\u000aof literary diarrhea. He writes definitely long prose, that to good,\u000abut of course I have known him long enough just to give the chills. But\u000ait has indeed given me pleasant surprise to find out that he has taken\u000aout his time to write novellas/novels like 'Rita Hayworth and The\u000aShawshank Redemption' and 'The Green Mile'. The latter, to tell you the\u000atruth, I haven't yet completed reading, it has been in limbo for some\u000atwo-three years, but though I don't care much about them, has received\u000apleasant reviews indeed. Now to the movie - except for Morgan Freeman,\u000athe star cast was pretty much unknown to me. But of course, great\u000aacting surpasses popularity. Each and every character of this movie had\u000aacted natural, without affectations, delivering masterful strokes,\u000amaking this movie seamless and without even a protruded bump in its\u000afluidic path. Of course, it has a great story to back on. Andy Dufresne\u000ais wrongly accused (as later in the movie, it is incontrovertibly\u000aproved) of a crime of passion and is convicted to a life sentence for\u000athe murder of two in a prison called Shawshank. Amidst the usual bets,\u000aabout which of the new inmates would break down on the very first day\u000a(the old-timers call them their race horses), Andy comes in last. A\u000acold-blooded fish, he is assumed to be, by his inmates "Red" (who\u000aconsiders himself to be Irish!), Bob and the rest of the "Red" Riding\u000aHoods, but soon enough, Andy earns their respect by going an extra mile\u000a(and also to protect himself from some hostile elements) and bravely\u000aputs up with the seriously dangerous warden (Bob Gunton) and his gun\u000atoting whelp of a chief guard (Clancy Brown). He soon enough finds\u000ahimself much in demand! But seriously, life in prison is hell. Be it\u000athe description of Arthur Road Jail (Shantaram!) or Shawshank in this\u000amovie, they all give me jeepers. After vicariously experiencing life in\u000ajail, I am always like, 'God, let me not commit any crime so notorious\u000athat it lands me at this concrete hell'. Frank Darabont and Stephen\u000aKing have covered it all  be it the doublespeak that the warden\u000aindulges into, the plight of institutionalized prisoners and the sheer\u000arottenness of the place. Amidst all that gloominess, like a tiny\u000aflicker, a scintilla of hope somehow survives in the form of Andy.\u000aTruly this movie is one of the best critically acclaimed (Imdb!) movie\u000aI have seen so far And to think that Rita Hayworth, the American\u000abeauty to be at the center of it all!!\u000a

V\u000aStarring : Tim Robbins, Morgan Freeman, James Whitmore Directed by :\u000aFrank Darabont 1994 American drama directed by Frank Darabont walked\u000awithout an Oscar to its name but had a lion's share in attaining\u000acritical acclaims and attracting the audience to it. This movie proves\u000aall its way that films devoid of Oscars can still be counted under a\u000amasterpiece. Set up in 1947, the film is about a smart banker Andy\u000aDufresene is imprisoned for killing his own wife and her lover. Though\u000ahe claims his innocence, he is thrown in a prison Shawshank where he\u000abefriends a smuggler Ellis Boyd "Red" Redding alias Red ( Morgan\u000aFreeman). The film exhibits different prisoners inside Shawshank and\u000ahow Andy tends to befriend them all except the Sisters (that is what\u000athey are called ) who try to kill Andy just to have some little fun.\u000aThe protagonist is shown up passing his time creating artistic stone\u000acarvings and watching sexy Hollywood actresses on the walls in his\u000acell. The film takes u on the ride inside the prison where cops take up\u000aentirely over the souls and lives of prisoners. Andy being a banker is\u000aplunged into money laundering business by one of the cops and the\u000awarden. The warden himself as a man of principles but wait ! inside he\u000ais just money- hungry beast. Even with concept of an old prisoner\u000aBrooks ( Whitemore ) who has spent 50 years of his life in the prison\u000aand gets 'institutionalized' with it and ends up hanging himself to\u000adeath when being released from Shawshanks adds up to the exciting plot\u000aof the film. The film is basically Andy's 20 years of imprisonment\u000ainside Shawshanks and his friendship with the fellow inmates and how\u000athings inside prison too also gets illegal sometimes. Shawshanks\u000aRedemption is a film which has a terrific ending. Watch it once and you\u000awill have an urge to watch it again.\u000a

V\u000aThere is nothing to criticize about this movie. It is made as subtle\u000aand touching a movie can be. It never goes into emotions more than\u000anecessary. The music, the story, the acting, everything is perfectly\u000aorchestrated. It is delicate and beautiful in all the sense of the\u000aterm. It is such a shame that Morgan Freeman didn't got an award, it\u000awould have been well deserved. Stephen King wrote again a masterpiece,\u000alike the Green Mile, from the same author and the same film director.\u000aFrank Darabont execute this story more in a tone that reminds me "Out\u000aof Africa". The prison is a character by itself, all the actors\u000aincluding the secondary roles are just perfect. Watching this movie\u000aremains us the true meaning of hope, and that everything is possible. But what are you doing here? Rather than reading reviews, just buy it,\u000arent it and see it. It is one kind of a unique movie that you will\u000anever forget.\u000a

V\u000aA wonderful film, truly one of the best ever made and deserving of its\u000aplace among the top films. There may be problems but the clever story\u000aline and brilliant actors will distract you from that. Tim Robbins has\u000aa good role as Andy Dufresne, the banker convicted for the murder of\u000ahis wife and her Lover. Morgan Freeman has an absolutely brilliant role\u000awith his portrayal of Red, the experienced prison Fixer, in an example\u000aof excellent casting. The film shows the corruption within the prison\u000asystem and has excellent characterisation. The idea of leaving prison\u000ais questioned throughout the film, as the characters wonder how\u000abeneficial leaving prison will really be. The film is certainly quite\u000aviolent but the storyline more then makes up for this. The ending is\u000adelightful to watch but I won't spoil it. You should watch the film\u000ayourself.\u000a

V\u000aI have often wondered, before seeing this film,how on Earth in became\u000athe No.1 rated film on IMDb. I felt it was certainly overrated as there\u000awere some masterpiece films that I believed deserved a higher rating,\u000asuch as the Lord of the Rings trilogy, Original Star Wars trilogy,\u000aGodfather Parts I and II as well as other classics like the first\u000aMatrix.However, I finally watched the film and I was completely stunned. I\u000ajust never expected the film to contain so much emotion and so little\u000aof worthless action. This film is one of the best films ever made and I\u000abelieve it certainly does deserve a No.1 ranking on IMDb.The acting in this film is just superb, especially by Morgan Freeman. I\u000amean, this legend, is in some of the best films ever made like\u000aShawshank Redemption, Se7en and the Dark Knight. Morgan Freeman is\u000asimply unbelievable in this film and the relationship between his\u000acharacter, Red and Andy was just superbly filmed. It actually gave me\u000atears****SPOILERS****When Brooks was finally released from Shawshank, he realises the\u000aoutside world is too much for him and commits suicide. This scene was\u000ajust so sad it left me crying. The same when Red was released, I again\u000astarted crying. The scene were Norton kills himself was totally surprising and a shock\u000ato me, realizing that Andy had truly defeated him and there was nothing\u000afor him to live for.The ending scene where Red and Andy reunite after all those days, or\u000ayears, was just breathtaking and I was glad the film ended the way it\u000adid. I've heard people complaining about the ending, saying that it was\u000atoo long and extended, but I strongly believe this ending worked\u000aperfectly well.****END OF SPOILERS****Overall, if anyone hasn't seen this film I'll tell you know....GO WATCH\u000aTHE FILM....You won't regret it.\u000a

V\u000aEveryone says the shawshank redemption is one of the best films made\u000abut i can't disagree. Everything about it makes it the film it is the\u000asound , setting and the narrating by Morgan freeman. The film is a\u000acrime drama and we understand at the start of the film that Andy\u000adufrense is a intelligent man and seems very quite at the beginning of\u000athe film, he seems a though he thinks a lot.We then get to understand Andy better when he becomes close friends\u000awith red who is has been at shawshank for many years. we are then shown\u000aas a spectator Andy experience in shawshank from fighting of the\u000arapists which then ends up with the main one getting transferred to\u000athen helping out Hadley with his financial issues to then becoming a\u000afriend of warden Norton. however this all changes when Andy finds out\u000athe warden can help him to get out of shawshank because he can prove he\u000ais innocent but the warden refuses to do this which turns out to be a\u000abig mistake for him as we come to see one of the best scenes of movie\u000awhen we find out Andy had escaped from shawshank but not only doing\u000athat giving the FBI all the corrupt documents that Norton was involved\u000ain which then leads to the FBI coming to arrest Norton.we then see red walking along the beach and smiles at Andy as he is\u000awalking up to him.It's not just the story than makes this a great film. the sound which\u000awas used in the film made it even better the music used was just right\u000afor each scene and was one of the best parts about the film also. if\u000ayou haven't watch the shawshank redemption yet i would recommend it.\u000a

V\u000aYes it might contain some clichés and be somewhat predictable but this\u000afilm is an absolute masterpiece and it is a clear leader at the top of\u000amy list of best films of all time. It is only a travesty that it didn't\u000awin the Oscars it deserved because of the hype surrounding Forrest Gump\u000athat year (not knocking FG because it is a great film also). This is the only film ever that everyone I meet agrees is a brilliant\u000amovie. If you are just coming out of the jungle or have been locked in\u000aa basement at the hands of a crazed lunatic for years and you somehow\u000aare one of the few people on the planet who hasn't seen this movie then\u000ayou have to change that right now !

V\u000aThis film is one of the few remaining masterpieces that hasn't needed,\u000anor will need to suffer the indignity of a poor remake.All throughout the film you feel truly connected to Andy & Red. From\u000athe trial in court, getting off the bus, through to Red finally getting\u000ahis parole at the end.The genius of the tunnelling through the walls, covering them with a\u000aposter, to the ingenuity of swapping the books and shoes over with the\u000aincompetent warden.Very well directed, amazing actor's at their best.Highly recommend for anyone wanting a good film.\u000a

V\u000aAs I'm writing this, the Shawshank Redemption is at #1 on the IMDb Top\u000a250. That means that IMDb users have given this movie a higher rating\u000athan the Lord of the Rings (2001-2003) movies, Forrest Gump (1994),\u000aTitanic (1997), etc. Is the Shawshank Redemption that good? Of course\u000anot, the IMDb Top 250 also puts Pulp Fiction (1994) and The Dark Knight\u000a(2008) above those movies. So personally I can't take the IMDb Top 250\u000avery seriously. It differs greatly from the All-Time Box Office lists\u000aas well. So why is the voting behavior of IMDb users so different from\u000athe movies people in general like to watch in the cinema? The Shawshank\u000aRedemption, for example, didn't do so well in the cinemas. At the\u000aAcademy Awards of 1995 the Shawshank Redemption was beaten by Forrest\u000aGump and Forrest Gump has also done well at the Box Office. Yet in the\u000aIMDb Top 250 Forrest Gump is at #28 (as I'm writing this). So why are\u000athe differences so vast? In my opinion it has everything to do with\u000ahype, what people understand (for example, for non-Americans Forrest\u000aGump is not as easy to understand as it is for Americans) and what\u000apeople want to be popular. What's really surprising is that the\u000aShawshank Redemption is not a movie about gays/pedophiles/anything\u000asexual (like I Love You Phillip Morris (2009) or Mysterious Skin\u000a(2004)), drugs or mafia (like The Godfather (1972)), trashing\u000aChristianity (like Paul (2011)) or anything along those lines, which is\u000awhat IMDb users are in general very fond of (as evident by the IMDb\u000aratings of such movies). Although the Shawshank Redemption is a prison\u000amovie. So I guess it's "cool" to say that you like a prison movie, as\u000aopposed to a movie that is about an unintelligent man (Forrest Gump),\u000aromance (Titanic) or elves/dwarfs/hobbits (Lord of the Rings). Yet, I\u000aguess, it's not very "cool" to go see it in the cinema with your\u000afriends, due to the exposure of the friendship between two men (who are\u000anot gay).Nonetheless, the Shawshank Redemption is an excellent movie. It's in my\u000aopinion the best prison movie so far. One of the best movies ever? Nah,\u000abut still very good. The casting of the movie is also excellent. It's\u000ahard to imagine that anyone other than Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman\u000acould portray Andy Dufresne or Ellis Boyd Redding as perfectly as they\u000ahave done. Everybody else in the movie has done an excellent job. The\u000aperformances are awesome. The story is enjoyable. Definitely a\u000arecommended movie. Just don't expect it to be the best movie ever, as\u000athe IMDb Top 250 may make you believe. It's, after all, based on a\u000aStephen King novel. Not that Stephen King is bad at what he is doing,\u000abut he is certainly no J.R.R. Tolkien. Combined with the director of\u000athe Shawshank Redepmtion, Frank Darabont, they are both certainly not\u000aJames Cameron. The Shawshank Redemption is just an excellent movie and\u000aprobably the best prison movie. That's it.\u000a

V\u000aHope is a powerful thing. Allow it to poison your mind and it will\u000adrive you to insanity; handle it with care and it will guide you to\u000aredemption.The Shawshank Redemption is the story of a man, Andy Dufresne (Tim\u000aRobbins), who has been convicted of a crime he claims he did not commit\u000a the gruesome double-murder of his wife and her secret lover in bed.\u000aHe is sentenced for two lifetimes at Shawshank State Penitentiary, one\u000afor each murder. The lanky, soft-centered Dufresne is soon befriended\u000aby Ellis Boyd 'Red' Redding, another lifer, played magnificently by the\u000aprolific Morgan Freeman, who is also the narrator of the story.What we see of Andy is through the eyes of Red. He is like the ocean \u000acalm on the surface, yet seething from within. He isn't shown crying,\u000abegging for mercy or slipping into madness despite the fact that he is\u000aforever haunted by his past and desire for redemption. The relationship\u000abetween the two men extends beyond just friendship  they are survivors\u000awho need the company of each other to make it through the hell they\u000afind themselves in.But the movie is not just about their friendship or Andy's desire for\u000aredemption. The life in prison too has been displayed with remarkable\u000aempathy. You feel for Andy as his life is brutally altered forever. You\u000afeel for Red as he is repeatedly denied parole despite his immaculate\u000abehavior. You feel for the men vilified and ostracized by society who\u000astill have humanity left within them.The performances by the two lead characters, Robbins and Freeman, are\u000asplendid. Robbins, in the shoes of Andy, touches you deeply with his\u000asoft-spoken, timid nature; but Freeman as Red steals the pie. His\u000aportrayal leaves a last impression on you and it is something you carry\u000awith you even after the end of the movie. His haunting voice brings\u000alife to the narrative as it resonates through the stony prison walls.\u000aHe carries his character with ease, not once letting his acting look\u000aforced or contrived. I wouldn't be hesitant in stating that this is\u000acertainly one of his best performances till date  and that's saying of\u000aa man who has given breathtaking performances in Se7en, The Bucket List\u000aand the Batman series. The other characters too fit their places  the\u000asadistic prison guard (Clancy Brown), the warden with rigid yet corrupt\u000aprinciples (Bob Gunton) and all the other inmates each with a personal\u000alife and voice of his own  nothing looks out of place. They work\u000atogether like cogs of a well-oiled machine, or in this case, a desolate\u000aprison.A feature that strikes you distinctly about the movie is the varying\u000acolour palettes. The hue of the film changes with the situation the\u000aprotagonist finds himself in. They are associated with the mood of the\u000ascenario. When hope is bleak, the screen is predominantly grey which\u000aconveys a sense of helplessness. In the prison, shades of blue create a\u000aclaustrophobic environment and overwhelm one with morbidity. At the\u000asame time, when Andy is happy, the settings are bright which helps\u000adevelop an atmosphere of ebullience and joy.The movie released in the same year as other masterpieces like Pulp\u000aFiction, The Lion King and Forrest Gump. Unfortunately, it missed out\u000aon the Oscar to the latter, yet IMDb terms this as the best movie of\u000aall times. Despite the greatness of the movie, somehow I beg to differ\u000awith that. I believe that there cannot be one best movie of all times.\u000aThis is a subjective area that varies with person and perception.Where does hope come into the picture? Everywhere. Just as with\u000aPandora's Box, when evil is overpowering, the only thing that remains\u000ais hope. Coupled with clever dialogue and heart wrenching moments, this\u000amovie reeks of emotions, out of which hope is the primary one. In the\u000awords of Andy Bufresne, 'there's something inside... that they can't\u000aget to, that they can't touch. That's yours.' It's hope.\u000a

V\u000aShawshank Redemption deserves to be ranked among the elite films of the\u000apast. Some complain that this will never be a classic and should not be\u000aranked with the Godfather, Schindler's List, Pulp Fiction...etc...Well\u000aguess what...This masterpiece of a film is rare breed. Sooner or later,\u000aa film deserving elite status WILL be produced,and there will be others\u000ain the future. You complainers would have said the same idiotic thing\u000aback in the early 70's, when The Godfather was released.Shawshank is a tremendous piece of work that forever will be thought as\u000aone of the elites ever produced in the history of film and cinema.Shawshank deserves to be #1 and I hope it retains that position.\u000aSomeday another elite film will be released and may overtake Shawshank\u000aand then the complainers will be out in full force once again! Can't\u000aplease everyone can we, typical stupidity once again.Thanks for such a wonderful piece of art and film....It's one DVD I\u000awill always keep in my library for many, many years to come! Shawshank\u000aRedemption is not the best film of the 1990's, it's one of the BEST\u000afilms of all time! Ranked right up there with other elite films of\u000asimilar caliber!\u000a

V\u000aI only need to write a few words. This film made me laugh, cry, cheer\u000aand feel warm inside. Not a lot of films are capable of doing that. The\u000aacting is brilliant and so believable. It's quite a long film, but\u000arightfully so. You are actually left feeling like you want more. Even\u000awriting these words down makes me want to get it out and watch it\u000aagain. It is always a good time to watch this film. You will not regret\u000ait.I'm actually surprised it hasn't got a full 10 stars.To the director i would say, Thank you for making this film!If you haven't seen it, watch it, right now. It doesn't matter what\u000atime it is...go! seriously go now!\u000a

V\u000aShank's a layman's classic. Talk to friends and family and the name\u000acomes up as a favorite. The film has a tight structure and a nice rise\u000ain tension, and we like the cast of characters. But what makes this a\u000afavorite is a gimmick. At the finish-line of the film we feel that rise\u000aof exhilaration where all is made equal. The antagonists meet their\u000aends and the heroes escape unscathed. The entire structure of the film\u000amoves us and captivates us...Andy, the perfect victim, faces guiltless\u000apunishment with little complaint and furrowed hope. Freeman's character\u000asmiles in his wise way as counts the weeks he knows he deserves. The\u000afilm's theme of hope becomes apparent early on, and is not distinct\u000afrom other 90s dramas. Even so, it works with the film's tensions and\u000atransfers that hope to the viewer in an unusually effective way. Sure,\u000aits 90s sentimentality, and its not great cinema. But its like a potent\u000aglass of wine, and can take our minds off our own problems and drop us\u000ainto that ever-circling illusion of hope that spurts from arts of this\u000asort.\u000a

V\u000aThis movie beyond doubt the best movie I've ever seen.. The plot , the\u000aacting , the setting are just amazing. Having said that I do have some\u000anegative comments. No , negative isn't the word , perhaps just my\u000aopinion on some parts of the film that could have been done better.The first thing that comes to mind is that I thought some bits were a\u000alittle too predictable. At some points during the movie I guessed what\u000athey were going to say and I was right on the money. I didn't get just\u000aget the same idea I mean I guessed word for word what they were saying.The second thing that bothered me a little was the ending. I don't want\u000ato give anything away but the way 'Red' found it so quickly , I mean of\u000aall the fields and brick walls in Bruxton, also the way he found Andy\u000aon the beach was just ... I donno I guess I was a little disappointed\u000abut I guess they had to make the ending like it is , the film is long\u000aas it is ( eh , I guess I'll have to check the spoilers little square\u000athing now ).But hey , who am I to judge.Well I guess that about sums it on the negative points that I thought\u000athis film had. I'm not going to state any good points because I'll be\u000ahere for weeks.\u000a

V\u000aAll right people, without giving away any spoilers, I can sum up the\u000aShawshank Redemption in one word: FLAWLESS. To me, this movie is second\u000aonly to American Beauty, due to the latter's thought provoking aura;\u000ahowever, technically speaking, this is the ultimate cinema achievement.\u000aWhile it is almost impossible to single out a perfect film, the\u000aShawshank Redemption is a serious contender for the title of best movie\u000aever made. Now I know people will gloat about Citizen Kane's\u000acinematography or The Godfather's character development, but the\u000aShawshank Redemption beats them all technically wise (watch the movie\u000aand see how everything works out flawlessly, it's really something\u000aquite special). The movie has a unique charm about it, evoking a\u000atranquil response from the audience. The ultimate feel good film, the\u000aShawshank Redemption is a monument of cinema greatness. The only thing\u000athe Godfather has over the Shawshank Redemption is the status of a\u000aclassic, largely due to critics' praise; on the other hand, movies\u000aafter the 1980's are considered as the "fall of cinema," or so it would\u000aappear through a critic's POV. Well, those movies have something that\u000athe so called classics do not, and that is the humane factor. After\u000aall, we are humans with feelings, and I think that through "art\u000aachievements" such as the Shawshank Redemption, human creativity itself\u000ais elevated to a higher status. Evoking emotion in the audience, one of\u000aShawshank's greatest strengths, is what makes the cinema experience\u000awhat it is: the pinnacle of human achievements.\u000a

V\u000aThe Shawshank Redemption is based on a short story by Stephen King.\u000aAndy Dufresne (Robbins) is imprisoned in Shawshank Prison for killing\u000ahis wife and her lover. Inside, he befriends Red (Freeman), another\u000ainmate, and keeps making changes around the place, which worries the\u000aprison warden.I watched the film when I found out that it had beat "The Godfather" to\u000athe top position on IMDb's Top 250 movies list. It was great, but I\u000adon't quite think it deserves the Nr 1 position. Don't get me wrong,\u000athe film is more than worth watching, but there's a lot of movies out\u000athere, just as good as this one and there's nothing outstandingly\u000aspecial about this one. It's great, nonetheless, and I can strongly\u000arecommend it.9/10\u000a

V\u000aThe Shawshank Redemption (1994) I've seen this film in its entirety now. Initially, I was afraid it\u000awould be a violent prison movie with very little meaning and would have\u000avery little to move me to tears. But it did. The film was Oscar worthy\u000abut it was a film that lost that year to "Forest Gump". Its release on\u000aVHS made the film very popular. Cable television airs the film\u000afrequently and it's even the stuff that film screenplay classes study\u000aas a sample of brilliant movie. Based on the short story by Stephen\u000aKing "Rita Hayworth and The Shawshank Redemption" it tells the story of\u000awealthy banker Andy (Tim Robbins) accused of murdering his wife and her\u000alover. The time at the start of the film is the 1940's and by the end\u000aof the film it's the 1960's. Andy has been sent to Shawshank, a\u000anotorious prison (in Washington state or Oregon) where harsh discipline\u000ais provided by the Warden (Bob Gunton) and by its captain of prison\u000aguards. The elements of a prison movie are indeed here (nightmarish\u000aconditions, cruel punishment, gay prisoners raping straight/hetero\u000aprisoners) but it becomes a prison movie at a higher level with its\u000atheme of redemption and humanity, hope and perseverance. The bond\u000abetween Morgan Freeman's character and Tim Robbins is perhaps the most\u000apoignant relationship of any two men portrayed on film. The prisoners\u000ahave lost hope and although not bitter, become very comfortable with\u000aprison life and know no other type of life. This was the tragedy of the\u000aprison librarian who after decades of prison life, could not cope with\u000athe real world that had changed after his release. His suicide is\u000aextremely depressing. The "bad guys" turn out to be not the criminals\u000awho attempt to rehabilitate themselves but the hypocritical and cruel\u000aWarden. Andy is innocent as proved by a later inmate's confession to\u000aknowing the true culprit (played by Gil Bellows) but the Warden is too\u000abent on keeping his image of having always done justice and keeps Andy\u000ain prison. The grim aspects of the film are nevertheless lightened by\u000ahumor, good writing, nuance in character and scenes that have such\u000apower and subtlety. The scene in which Andy plays an opera album (Le\u000aNozze Di Figaro by Mozart, duet "Sull'aria from the 1968 Karl Bohm\u000aalbum with Edith Mathis and Gundula Janowitz) is so moving and so\u000atouching. Andy's subsequent escape and the table-turned justice when\u000athe investigation into the corruption of the prison leads to the demise\u000aof the administration.This movie ranks as one of the finest made in the 1990's, with\u000aexcellent writing and fine acting. It's a movie that has become a\u000aclassic and that continues to hold audiences enthralled.\u000a

V\u000aAlways a favorite of the members of this site, "The Shawshank\u000aRedemption" has proved itself to be much more than your average film\u000aabout prisoners. It took me a bit of time to reflect on this movie\u000abefore I truly realized how great it was. In this film, Tim Robbins\u000aplays Andy Dufresne, a man sent to prison after being falsely accused\u000aof murder. He meets Red (Morgan Freeman in one of his best roles), and\u000athe two of them leave prison many years later as changed men. I can't\u000aexplain what sets this film apart from so many films like it, but it\u000asimply fascinates me. Watching Andy bring redemption to himself and the\u000aother prisoners and his clever methods of escaping from prison are\u000awonderfully done, especially when you don't realize until later what he\u000ais doing. Perhaps my favorite scene of the film is when Morgan Freeman\u000agives his final speech on why he should be let out of jail, as this\u000atruly displays how much he has changed throughout the film. His choice\u000aof words is brilliant, and the scene can't help but make the viewer\u000athink. The film could be cut down a bit, as some of the scenes are\u000afairly unnecessary and repetitive. However, even if you don't think the\u000afilm is anything special the first time you see it, give it some time.\u000a"The Shawshank Redemption" gets better and better the more you reflect\u000aon it in your mind, and the second viewing will prove it.***1/2 out of ****\u000a

V\u000aIt is a well-known fact that The Shawshank Redemption is one of the\u000amost well-made and moving films in the past twenty years as well as in\u000acinema history. It doesn't have the formula that fits most huge\u000asuccesses. It consists of almost two and a half hours of dialogue\u000abetween many prisoners that carry on for nearly twenty years. To the\u000amajority of movie-goers, that is a recipe for boredom. However, for\u000athose who appreciate the medium of film as less than entertainment and\u000amore as enlightenment, this is the perfect example.In order to be so effective, this type of movie really only needs two\u000avery successful angles: the acting and the writing. Both are covered\u000aquite well. Morgan Freeman is terrific as Red as are all the supporting\u000acharacters. However, it is Tim Robbins as Andy that sticks with me\u000aafter the movie is done. Somehow, and Frank Darabont deserves credit as\u000awell for writing this character so thoroughly, Robbins is able to\u000aembody a kind, considerate yet gentle spirit into a man that is\u000aallegedly convicted of murdering two people. This alone is evidence to\u000ashow he couldn't have done it. With this blessing, he is able to\u000ainfluence nearly everybody he comes into contact with, especially Red.\u000aTogether, they form a bond most people only dream of. And this is what\u000alies at the heart of The Shawshank Redemption. According to Andy, there\u000ais a feeling, and idea that drives a man to try and overcome all\u000aobstacles he faces and to not rest until he has done so. That would be\u000ahope, and with this Andy Dufresne is determined to come out on top.Simply put, this is a true piece of art as well as being on the best\u000afilms of the 1990s and one of the best films ever made.\u000a

V\u000aGreat movie! It deserves it's place of #1 out of 250! If you haven't\u000aseen it, see it. I don't know if it's possible to make a better version\u000aof this, because they did it perfectly the first time. It's a perfect\u000aexample of the human spirit, as many critics have already said.\u000aPerfectly narrated, excellent acting, good script, nothing's missing! The story's from Stephen King, in Four Seasons. This is under Fall, I\u000abelieve. Stephen King wrote the novellas over a long period of time,\u000aand another movie that spawned from that book is Stand By Me.If you haven't seen this, see it. If you want to see it, see it. If you\u000adon't want to see it, you're probably crazy, but see it anyways. The\u000aShawshank Redemption is a perfect movie, and you should see it, if you\u000ahaven't already.4/4\u000a

V\u000aMisery and Stand By Me were the best adaptations up until this one, now\u000ayou can add Shawshank to that list.This is simply one of the best films ever made and I know I am not the\u000afirst to say that and I certainly won't be the last. The standing on\u000athe IMDb is a true barometer of that. #3 as of this date and I'm sure\u000ait could be number 1. So I'll just skip all the normal praise of the\u000afilm because we all know how great it is. But let me perhaps add that\u000awhat I find so fascinating about Shawshank is that Stephen King wrote\u000ait.King is one of the best writers in the world. Books like IT and the\u000aCastle Rock series are some of the greatest stories ever told. But his\u000abest adaptations are always done by the best directors. The Shining was\u000abrilliantly interpreted by Kubrick and of course the aforementioned\u000aMisery and Stand By Me are both by Rob Reiner. Now Frank Darabont comes\u000aonto the scene and makes arguably the best King film ever. He seems to\u000aunderstand what King wants to say and he conveys that beautifully.What makes this film one of the best ever made is the message it\u000aconveys. It is one of eternal hope. Andy Dufresne, played by Tim\u000aRobbins, has been sent to prison for a crime he did not commit. But he\u000anever loses hope. He never gives up his quest to become a free man\u000aagain. His years of tenacity, patience and wits keep him not only sane,\u000abut it gives his mind and a spirit a will to live. This film has a\u000adifferent feel to it. There has never been anything like it before and\u000aI don't know if there will again.I'm not going to say any more about this film, it has already been\u000asaid, but just suffice to say that I am glad that Forrest Gump won best\u000apicture in 94. I would have been equally glad if Pulp Fiction or\u000aShawshank would have won. It is that good of a movie and one that will\u000abe appreciated for years to come.\u000a

V\u000aThe Shawshank Redemption is just an utterly moving motion picture that\u000amakes you really have a feel for the characters in this movie. It truly\u000awill move you in some sort of way, because it is very deeply emotional\u000aat times. Morgan Freeman did an excellent job as always and really put\u000aon an amazing role in this movie. Tim Robbins truly stole the show with\u000ahis Grade A performance. If you have the time to sit through this very\u000along movie, then you should definitely see The Shawnshank Redemption,\u000abecause it is a motion picture that will make you feel in dept emotions\u000afor the characters in the movie, it is by far a classic and one of the\u000abest movies of the 90's.\u000a

V\u000aWell i have watched all the movies listed on IMDb top 250,all the AFI\u000a100 movies and other major titles.But, without a single doubt in my mind, i can say this is by far, by\u000afar the most beautiful masterpiece that Hollywood ever produced. It is\u000amore than just a film because it takes you away with it. As Roger Ebert\u000awrites "watching Shawshank takes away the feeling that you are watching\u000aa film". That's exactly what it does to you, you become dissolve in the\u000acharacters and are able to feel the atmosphere.Tim Robbins as a quite Andy Dufresne is Brilliant. And Freeman as Red\u000awhat can i say even at this moment while writing this comments I can\u000afeel his story narrating style and voice in my head.Direction, Cinematography and Screenplay are excellent. You can't take\u000ayou eyes from the screen for a second.The climax is one of the best i have seen.For people who haven't seen it i would like to say, you haven't seen\u000athe most beautiful work of Art in the World.It deserves more than just ten Stars and seven Oscars nominations.\u000a

V\u000aWhen the movie starts also starts your journey through what is pure in\u000athis life: friendship, hope, courage.This movie is a piece of art from which everybody takes what they need.\u000aIt gives us understanding of hard work which will be rewarded. It shows\u000athat true happiness is what we are working for all our life.Isn't it wonderful, that true feelings and inspiration can visit us\u000ajust by watching a movie? But don't be mistaking. You aren't just to\u000awatch the film. You have to receive it with your heart as much as you\u000areceive it with your head.I guarantee that each of us will be smiling. Just like they did.\u000a

V\u000aSometimes it takes watching a two-hour film set in a prison to\u000aunderstand part of what life is about. At least "The Shawshank\u000aRedemption" has me convinced that's the case. This movie is one that\u000adoes all the little things right and ultimately lets the story do all\u000athe talking--a story of hope and finding meaning, purpose and\u000amotivation in life or sometimes quite frankly, to live.Writer and director Frank Darabont, who is the unquestioned king of\u000aadapting Stephen King prison stories and turning them into touching\u000amotion pictures, debuts here as a director who has an understanding of\u000awhen to leave excessive artistic tinkering out of a film. Having\u000acreated this outstanding screenplay, the script and the images flow\u000aseamlessly together throughout this film, so much that even the big\u000amoments feel naturally styled. He uses dark and light contrasts and\u000asome repetitive images to create a slightly fluctuating monotony to the\u000aprison life and those are the only "tricks."The story is that of Andy Dufresne (Robbins), convicted to Shawshank\u000aPrison in the opening minutes of the film to life x2 for the murder of\u000ahis wife and her lover. The film then shifts to the narrative of Red\u000a(Morgan Freeman) who has been a con at Shawshank since he was very\u000ayoung. While the film focuses on what happens to Andy in this vortex of\u000ainhumanity, what you don't realize is how the story is really about Red\u000aand what Andy makes him realize. Andy is a smart and clever guy and\u000amost of the first hour of the film is about how he brings some humanity\u000ato the prison and a mentality that is not common in a place with guys\u000aserving life terms.Robbins was definitely ripped off on an Oscar nod. Its not that he\u000ablows you away with his dramatic skills, but it's that as you watch him\u000ayou never once question his integrity as a character. Sometimes being\u000athat believable should be worthy of an Oscar, not just over- dramatic\u000atalents or actors playing unique roles. Freeman, however, gets his nod\u000aand that was also deserved. If I could have anyone narrate my life, it\u000awould be Freeman.The second hour of the film turns it into a bit of a thriller as the\u000awarden (Bob Gunton) turns corrupt and begins to test Andy's limits.\u000aWhile many films do this, what makes "Shawshank" special is that you\u000afigure things out just as they are about to happen, which is\u000asatisfying. It's not too early that you think it stupid, but it doesn't\u000acome out of nowhere either. This hour of the film picks up the pace and\u000abrings it from just a depiction of prison life to something special and\u000ait's crucial to making the film as enjoyable as it is."Shawshank" is not one of my favorite films, but it's the kind of film\u000aI could stop and watch every time it's on TV just because of its\u000aprevailing positive attitude. While it is so dark, it is so positive\u000aand motivating as it give the benefit of the doubt to those who do\u000awrong. It's unforgiving, but then it becomes redeeming. The way it\u000amakes you conform to a prisoner's confined mindset and takes you out\u000ainto the real world in just snippets that seem just eye- opening like\u000athe scenes in the grocery store can give you a whole other perspective\u000aon life. That and the script just writes itself out exactly as you know\u000ait should. Rarely does a film leave you as satisfied as this one does.\u000aWhile it might not be an artistic masterpiece of cinema, it is truly\u000aone of the greatest stories Hollywood has ever told.\u000a

V\u000aI've seen this film a few times now but its only recently that i can\u000areally appreciate it for what it is, a truly remarkable story. As I've\u000agrown up since the first time I've seen it, i could only remember the\u000amain storyline and barley its characters and previously just thrown the\u000aname of this film around in social circles to sound like i knew what i\u000awas talking about. I find this story, the greatest story ever told\u000athrough the medium of film (although originally a novel) purely on its\u000amerit and its inspirational tone towards life in general.I sit here choking on my words because none of them seem adequate\u000aenough to describe how highly i think of this film and how much of a\u000aheart warming glow i received after I recently sat down and really\u000adigested its story. It is in my opinion one of the the best pictures\u000aever. I think it appeals to a lot of people. Its a story of friendship and\u000ahope. Im sorry its THE story of friendship and hope no other can\u000aportray the meanings of each better and i personally was amazed when i\u000afound out there was no Oscar's to its credit.this film will always transcend decades and times as a great story\u000a

V\u000aAn accountant named Andy Dufresne, played by Tim Robbins is found\u000aguilty of murdering his wife and her boyfriend. He is sent to Shawshank\u000aprison, a prison run by a God-fearing and a strict warden. Andy meets\u000a'Red' played by Morgan Freeman at Shawshank and the lives of the\u000aprisoners and their emotions is captured in the movie in an excellent\u000amanner. The premise of the movie looks too simple but there are a very\u000afew movies that are as powerful as Shawshank Redemption. You can watch\u000athis movie time and again without getting bored. The first time I saw\u000athe movie, by the time it was almost coming to an end I felt that it\u000awas a pretty good movie and then there was this unexpected and a\u000amemorable ending followed by an explanation in Morgan Freeman's deep\u000avoice that made the movie simply great. I couldn't help but stand up\u000aand clap at the completeness of the movie. It captures every possible\u000ahuman emotion and portrays them every possible way you wanna see it.\u000aThe movie runs at a pretty good pace, no lags or halts or irrelevant\u000ascene added to enhance the effects of the movie, and a simple\u000abackground score. Or in other words this movie has its own natural\u000aflow, nothing in it seems out of place. Add to all this is the fine\u000aacting of Morgan Freeman, Tim Robbins and all the other support crew.\u000aThis is a classic and not to be missed for any reason whatsoever.\u000a

V\u000aThe Shawshank Redemption is honestly one of the greatest movies ever.I\u000awas too young when i watched it for the first time and i didn't get\u000amuch,so i watched it again some months ago.At the end i was left with a\u000afeeling of freedom and perhaps redemption.This movie gives you\u000ahope,which in my opinion is very importand.It is a movie about human\u000adignity,about always trying to be a better person.The Shawshank\u000aRedemption is meant to change the person that watches it.I give it a\u000a10,although it deserves much more.Apart from these,Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman are absolutely\u000aexcellent. If i had to describe their performances with one word that\u000awould be overwhelming.Let's hope more movies like this come out.\u000a

V\u000aOne of the greatest films of all time. Frank Darabont, through his own\u000ascreenplay of this Stephen King story, directs arguably the most\u000apowerful tale of hope and freedom in this masterpiece of a movie that\u000ashould be watched by all. Andy Dufresne, charged guilty of the murders\u000aof his wife and her lover, is sent to Shawshank prison to serve\u000aback-to-back life sentences. This is the account of his legendary stay\u000ain the detention center as told by his friend, Ellis Redding. Packed\u000awith outstanding performances by Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman, this\u000ais perhaps one of the most memorable films of the nineties, nominated\u000afor 7 Academy Awards including Best Picture which it ultimately lost to\u000aForrest Gump. It is one of those films that leave you elated by the\u000aend, filled with happiness for its fictional characters that you\u000aeventually feel for. This will be the most satisfying\u000atwo-and-a-half-hour film you'll probably ever sit right throughout. For\u000aa film that looks targeted to a male audience, it is one that\u000atranscends gender. Totally recommended.http://iwascalledclementine.multiply.com/reviews\u000a

V\u000aAlong with Forrest Gump, this is my #1 movie of all time.This is a painful movie to watch... but just like Forrest's mom told\u000ahim when she was dying of cancer, "Pain if a part of life, Forrest." I\u000abelieve there's value in feeling the pain this movie emits to its\u000aviewer.No one else in the world could have played the role or "Red" better\u000athan Morgan Freeman; indeed, he was born to play this role, period. His\u000aperformance was simply off the hook, and largely what "made" this\u000amovie.The ending of the movie is a real tear-jerker, yet so satisfying,\u000aleaving the viewer with such a nice, warm comfortable feeling. So, in a\u000asense, you have a sad, gut-wrenching movie that actually has a happy\u000aending.This movie was perfect.-Tracy Milburn\u000a

V\u000aThat's normally pretty hard to say, though the fact that the book is a\u000aStephen King novella (150ish pages +/-) makes sense why the movie is\u000abetter. Not bashing King here, just saying most of the movies based on\u000ahis work tend to be pretty decent and novellas aren't meaty enough for\u000amy taste. Most the time when I finish a novella I wish there had been\u000amore substance.As far as the movie goes, I'm sure everyone else has mentioned why it's\u000aso great. If you love this movie check out the book, they're pretty\u000amuch dead on besides a few details. Unlike other novellas of King's\u000ae.g. Apt Pupil ... the extra details in that book made it so much\u000abetter than the movie.\u000a

V\u000aSpending decades in prison for a crime you didn't commit can make an\u000aimpact on your life. When you bond with a fellow inmate, life will be\u000aeasier, and redemption follows through. In "The Shawshank Redemption",\u000atwo fellow inmates bond throughout the years of hardships and good\u000atimes. Andy Dufresne(Tim Robbins), was arrested for killing his wife\u000aand lover, out of pure anger. He meets Red(Morgan Freeman) and they\u000aspend years together ironing out the rough spots. With all other\u000adangerous inmates around like murders and rapists, prison life is a\u000aliving hell! Sometimes the real villains in prison are the officials,\u000aincluding the warden(Bob Gunton), who was the worst of the bunch. Other\u000ainmates who raped or stabbed others got worse treatment than the other\u000aconvicts. Being in the "Hole"(Solitary Confinment) is not for the weak.\u000aOne elderly convict Brooks Halten(James Whitmore), couldn't adapt to\u000asociety very well when he got out. Got a new place and hangs himself.\u000aAndy, is very clever. He out cons the warden, gives Red a chance to\u000alive the good life, and he made himself a new man. There's a second\u000achance for ex-convicts, if they can give it. 5 stars!\u000a

V\u000aI was turned on to this movie by my late uncle Ed. He is forever\u000acaptured in my memories every time I see this wonderful movie or hear\u000athe soundtrack. The Harmonica and orchestra is so intense, it just\u000alives with me forever. Our favorite track was Zihuataneho, it is where\u000awe will meet in heaven. Thomas Newmann has created so many beautiful\u000asoundtracks, but this is my all time favorite. The greatest ending of\u000aany movie, it just lets us know that in the end, justice will be\u000aserved... When I think of this movie my favorite line is get busy\u000aliving or get busy dying.

V\u000aAfter just watching this film again for a fifth time or something, i\u000afelt compelled to do my very first movie comment on IMDb. This movie\u000aleft me shaken with so many emotions, after a ride through so many more\u000aof those emotions throughout the movie, that i am sure i will watch it\u000aagain not too far in the future. Maybe ride is not the best way to\u000adescribe this, it was more like an gentle but firm hand guiding me\u000aalong, letting myself be the one who decides how to react to the turns\u000aand pictures of this film. And just when i started to catch the drift\u000aand thought I've had it all figured out, this film surprised me once\u000amore in a way i never would have suspected.Another big plus is that you don't get distracted by the actors,\u000abecause they are all at their best. Every character has some real\u000acontribution to the story, and the actors are just great in their\u000aroles. Amazing is a better word. Great Acting! I never had a reason to\u000adoubt any characters authenticity.I have never checked if this movie has been nominated, or won any\u000aprices, but if it hasn't, it should. I don't now if the story of this\u000afilm could happen in the real world, but the emotions it invoked in me\u000aare true and real, and it got me thinking about life and the way i\u000aconceive freedom in a whole new way.I apologize for my writing style for i am not a native English speaker.\u000aAny corrections or improvements are welcome and appreciated as i am\u000aalway keen to learn.\u000a

V\u000aI have to admit I ignored this film in the 90's because I thought it\u000awas a violent film set in a prison with a bleak experience but seeing\u000ait last Holy Week, the movie moved and inspired me. The film was about\u000aHope, Faith, Friendship and Determination and Guts, We have been\u000aprisoners of our own lives whether it be jobs, family life, social\u000aissues, you name it which becomes so routinary yet we never dared to\u000agrow further ahead that there are things outside our walls that are\u000anever discovered. This film teaches you that. What use is our dreams, talents and positive outlook in life when we're\u000anot determined to push it further to the next level? It is really an\u000ainspiring film to watch over and over again, and something that you\u000acould share and teach to other people who have given up hope and faith.\u000aIndeed it quickly became one of my latest movie bibles of all time\u000aWhenever you feel hopeless and down watch this film and be revitalized\u000ato pursue your dreams and recover from your losses.Get busy living or get busy dying.\u000a

V\u000aYes this is simply a magnificent piece of work which remains powerful\u000aand moving and probably always will.It's been 14 years but who can\u000aforget such a masterpiece.This is a movie about how strong the human\u000afaith and spirit can be.Even in the most difficult moments we have to\u000aremain strong and believe in justice.This is what Shawshank is all\u000aabout.I have never read the Steven King novel but he definitely should\u000abe proud that a director such as Frank Darabont has the passion and\u000adesire in making a powerful and faithful adaptation to King's work.A\u000amoving film with superb performances from all the actors but the real\u000acredit goes to Tim Robbins as the wrongfully accused Andy Dufresne\u000awhose spirit and will help him find freedom and Morgan Freeman as Ellis\u000a'Red' Redding who serves a life-long sentence but hopes he can be freed\u000afrom guilt.Throughout the movie we witness much suffering,injustice and\u000asorrow but that's what makes the characters so pleasant and worth\u000asympathizing for.Andy's desire to become a free man again is truly a\u000amagical but also difficult adventure.But he never loses his hope and\u000athat is what helps him succeed.The final scene when Andy and Ellis meet\u000aeach other outside the steel cage prison is phenomenal and touching.It\u000ais a real shame that a movie so great didn't win a single Oscar\u000aalthough it had 7 nominations.\u0410 real unfairness cause this movie is\u000aindeed better than Forrest Gump.In conclusion I'll just say that\u000aShawshank is a timeless masterpiece and deserves to be in the top 10\u000agreatest films of all time.\u000a

V\u000aThe shawshank redemption is the greatest film of all time, in my\u000aopinion. Having read great reviews for the film, i was determined to\u000awatch it myself. And that was probably the greatest film decision ever\u000amade by me. I will never forget the engrossing intensity of this\u000amasterpiece, it will stay with me and many others for years to come.It centres around a wrongly convicted prisoner Andy Dufresne and\u000aanother nicknamed Red by his friends. After Red sees the wrongful\u000aimprisonment he becomes Andy's best friend and they create an\u000aunbreakable bond that is the core of the film. Years go by in Shawshank\u000aprison and the pair live with the tortures of shawshank. The neglect,\u000athe murder and the horror.But Andy changes this. He does extraordinary things for the inmates. HE\u000abefriends the guards, builds a big library and helps people with their\u000aproblems. He saves them from institutionalisation.In the end an incredible series of events allows Andy to turn these\u000afactors on the prison and to get the responsible people imprisoned\u000athemselves. Andy escapes and leaves for a new life abroad. Red is\u000areleased soon after and follows him. The ending sees them reunited.This is a definitive tale of how the human spirit can be denied\u000anothing.\u000a

V\u000aI Thought this movie was the most amazing movie I've ever seen next to\u000aThe Lord Of The Rings Trilogy, i don't know why its not there next to\u000aThe Shawshank Redemption. I've watched this movie now a fair few times\u000aand on the special features on the DVD i seen the Director goes onto\u000athis site IMDb. And he also said that His movie has been in the top of\u000athe charts for years now been switching up and down between The\u000aShawshank Redemption And The Godfather. I Think The Shawshank\u000aRedemption should be at number one because its just a pure inspiration\u000ato the movie industry and it should have a cinema anniversary or\u000asomething with its 15th anniversary or something, i thought this movie\u000awas pure brilliant and i see everyone else nearly everyone else thinks\u000athe same, But it seems the director has only made one film that has\u000abeen descent after this which was The Green Mile. That was good but not\u000aas good as The Shawshank Redemption, But good. Its seems the Director\u000ais an expert at Prison Films because he hasn't done well with his other\u000afilms only 'The Shawshank Redemption And 'The Green Mile'. I Still\u000athink he's a really good director. I Own it on DVD and Own The\u000aSoundtrack, its brilliant , i love the songs from it. Anyway thats it,\u000aI Hope to make a film like this in the future as though I'm only 17\u000aliving in Ireland, The film industry in Ireland is rubbish so i\u000astruggling to get ideas of what i can do to push myself to an idea that\u000acould give me the lift tha ti need to star my film career alight, I\u000aLove films so much. Anyway thats it , I LOVE this film. PS . Sorry for\u000athe bad spelling i had typed a bit quick. Bye, Email me if your as\u000ainterested in film as i, Or possible the director, if your looking at\u000athis could you email me, gives us ideas man, Cheers. ,\u000azkeveoz@hotmail.com Thanks Kevin Walsh\u000a

V\u000aThis has to be one of the only films that, if not actually hitting\u000aperfection definitely brushes it.At first one would be wary of it I'm sure. A Stephen King novel about\u000aprison doesn't at first sound too stimulating (especially if you have\u000awatched Christine, a killer car cmon!) but it certainly does stimulate.Even if you cannot understand or relate to the underlying message of\u000aconformity and institutionalisation that the script is getting across\u000ait doesn't matter as the characters are believable due to high quality\u000aacting on everyones part.As my summary says perfection. The directing in this is perfect, every\u000ascene every shot seems to have been thought out to maximum potential.\u000aThe acting is not over emotional like many a film is these days or not\u000awooden like many other films are but its believable, emotions just\u000aright, every facial expression effective.Though I'm more a fan of unconventional cinema that doesn't follow the\u000astandard Todorov form of thesis, anti-thesis and synthesis. This still\u000astrikes a chord with me because it seems to raise it's standards above\u000athat of the classic cinema standard.All in all I will defend this movie till death as it really is one that\u000ayou must watch. For those of you who have already watched it, I plead\u000ayou to watch again.\u000a

V\u000aI simply do not know how some people out there voted this movie\u000aanything less than a 6 or 7, but a small percentage had the audacity to\u000avote it a "ONE"! There are always that small percentage. Sometimes I\u000abelieve people vote down other movies in some attempt to get THEIR\u000afavorite movie into a certain spot. The fact that people put that much\u000aeffort into doing so amazes me. I'll take the time to comment on a\u000amovie and give my 2 cents worth of opinion. This movie was a classic\u000athe day it premiered and the 2nd place showing overall demonstrates\u000athat without fault. My hope is those who voted it down somehow obtain a\u000aclue.\u000a

V\u000alike "The Shawshank Redemption,"The Green Mile" is another case of a\u000aStephen King story which translates well from the page to the screen.as\u000ain "Mile",this movie is also directed by Frank Darabont,who also wrote\u000athe screenplay.another similarity is the prison setting and the fact\u000athat the movie is seen and told through the eyes of one man (Morgan\u000aFreeman)who just happens to be a prison lifer and the things he sees as\u000athe years go by.he tells the story of one man who becomes a\u000aprisoner(TIm Robbins) and who he becomes friends with.the movie then\u000achronicles their friendship and struggles in the prison system.unlike\u000a"The Green Mile",there is no mystical or supernatural element to this\u000afilm.however,this film is of the same calibre of "Mile",owing to its\u000asolid writing, acting, and direction."Shawshank" is very dramatic,yet\u000avery compelling.it's also a very moving tale.it will likely impact you\u000aemotionally and intellectually. and before i forget,i must also mention\u000athe ending,which i thought was very strong.for me,"The Shawshank\u000aRedemption" is a strong 10/10\u000a

As of now May 24th 2007, there is 255,456 people who have rated\u000athis movie. 150,715 rate it 10/10.This movie is not over-rated and remains my favorite movie of all time.\u000aWhy?

V\u000aThis film was so deep. Suicide, murder, innocence, friendship and of\u000acourse hope.I watched only a bit of this film at one point and thought its alright.\u000aBut i looked at its rating being no.2 and thought "really". I was then\u000adesperate to see what makes this film the top of the nineties. Watched\u000ait with my family and it simply blew me away. The way it was sad was\u000ahappy just realising that Andy difference (who was arrested for\u000amurdering his wife and her lover when drunk) was all this time innocent\u000aafter spending 19 years in shawshank prison. its the police that show\u000awho are the good guys but in this its the other way round and the way\u000ait was done was exciting and intelegant.The scripts was fantastic, the acting was sensational and most of all\u000athe story was one the best ever explained in a film (infact the best\u000aever).we all have our opinions but if you think this film is rubbish for no\u000aspecific reason then there is something wrong with you.\u000a

V\u000aLet me start by praising 'The Shawshank Redemption' as is it's due.\u000aThis is a gripping, manipulative, emotional prison drama with a tricksy\u000aplot based on a Stephen King story: as often with King, it's\u000aimplausible, but director Frank Darabont handles its development so\u000awell that it seems believable as you watch it. Praise given, I now need\u000ato make clear that I do not consider this one of the best movies of all\u000atime, in spite of the ecstatic opinions of IMDb users (and others).\u000aFirst of all, the film paints a somewhat romantic picture of prison\u000alife. This may seem an odd thing to say (the life of the convicts is\u000aterrible), but the characters divide neatly into good guys and bad\u000aones, the good ones share a sense of community but what's lacking is\u000athe idea that the victims of the prison world were the violators of the\u000afree one; all the murderers seem far too cuddly to convince. The only\u000apossible exception is the lead character, whose almost inhuman resolve\u000amakes it seem highly possible that (in spite of his protests to the\u000acontrary) he is justly imprisoned; when this ambiguity is resolved\u000ahalf-way through, the film loses something, and he becomes more myth\u000athan man. The real problem with the main twist (and the uplifting\u000amessage it imparts) is not its improbability, but that it softens the\u000aworld-view of the movie too much. The other main problem is that the\u000afilm is too long: a braver director might have cut it dead at the crux,\u000abut Darabont insists of tying up every loose end, and wringing out\u000aevery last drop of emotion in the process. It's still a very smart\u000apiece of entertainment; but its claims to greatness lie mainly in being\u000aexactly what its audience want to watch, rather than in supreme\u000aartistic merit.\u000a

V\u000aI still remember my satisfaction when I came out of the movie theater\u000aand thought with myself: this is the best movie I've ever seen.More than 10 years have gone since, and I still think the same way.\u000aWhy? Because it makes you go through almost every single feeling a\u000ahuman being can feel. Love, hate, sadness, loneliness, friendship...\u000aand above all, hope. Hope is beautiful. Hope is essential.There were times in my life that, for any reason, I needed to feel some\u000ahope, so I watched this movie and life seemed wonderful again. It gives\u000ayou the impression that everything is possible, and no matter how bad\u000ayou're feeling, you'll be certain that everything will get better.Besides all that, the movie plot hooks you through the entire movie,\u000anot to mention the amazing performances by Tim Robbins and Morgan\u000aFreeman.It's a masterpiece and should not be missed by anyone.\u000a

V\u000aI first saw this film when it came out in 1994 and unlike what most\u000apeople may have thought, I loved it. I thought that it should have most\u000adefinitely taken the Best Picture award over the vastly inferior and\u000avastly overrated Pulp Fiction. This is the kind of film that comes\u000aalong only once in a lifetime. The story, the gripping performances,\u000athe settings, the acting, everything molds together to make such a work\u000aof art. This goes beyond film making I believe. I'm having a loss for\u000awords to describe this piece of cinematic brilliance.The best I can say is that you just have to see this for yourself to be\u000aable to appreciate its beautiful storytelling and the message it gives\u000ayou. Watching this movie will give you hope and courage. Courage to get\u000athrough your everyday life. To overcome any obstacles you may encounter\u000aon your path in life. This movie is simply this powerful. Rent it or\u000abetter yet, buy it now and witness for yourself why this is #2 on the\u000atop 250 list. Personally, it's #1 for me and a lot of others.\u000a

V\u000aMy heart did back flips when I discovered that "The Shawshank\u000aRedemption" had been rated the #2 movie overall by users of the IMDb.\u000aThere is little that can parallel my satisfaction of knowing that the\u000aviewing public can still tell excellent film when they see it, despite\u000adangerous competition with other pictures of its time. Particularly in\u000aa year (1994) which saw the release of Quentin Tarantino's "Pulp\u000aFiction", family-friendly blockbuster "The Lion King", and the\u000anow-immortal "Forrest Gump" (all of which are, indeed, outstanding\u000afilms) it would have been easy for "Shawshank" to glide under the radar\u000aof North American audiences of the time, and of future years. Yet here\u000ait stands, one of the most widely recognized and highly praised movies\u000aof the century.But why? What of the films like "Forrest Gump", "The Lion King", and\u000a"Pulp Fiction"? How has "The Shawshank Redemption" stood stronger\u000aagainst the test of time than its award-sweeping, box office-smashing\u000acontemporaries? Much of the credit goes to writer Frank Darabont, whose\u000ascreen adaptation of Stephen King's short story assembles the plot of\u000athe film in such a way, that this movie gets better and better every\u000atime you watch it, while all the time spelling out an inspiring and\u000aimportant message of hope and, as the titles indicates, redemption.Brought to life by a stellar cast and splendid cinematography, "The\u000aShawshank Redemption" is proof that given the time, the cream always\u000arises to the top.\u000a

V\u000aThis is THE greatest movie of all time, bar none. It should be #1, I\u000adon't care if you love Star Wars or if you love The Godfather. I don't\u000alike them, don't get me wrong, they maybe great movies in somebody\u000aelse's eye, but how the whole world cannot relate to the Shawshank\u000aRedemption is incredible.It just shows the difference between some people. I am probably being a\u000abit shallow here, but I believe all the evil, racist and bad people\u000ahave not seen the Shawshank Redemption, and if they have seen, haven't\u000areally understood it. They're too narrow minded. If you understand this\u000amovie, it will change your life, make no mistake about it.After I saw this, I just knew...you in life, there are some things you\u000ajust KNOW, with gut instinct...eg, when your in love or something? I\u000ajust knew, no matter how old I got, how mature I became...I would never\u000asee anything like this. I am only 19 and god knows how many movies I\u000amay see in the future, if I live long enough but I can honestly say, I\u000awill not ever see anything better.This just sums life up. If I don't watch this like every now and again,\u000amy life seems incomplete. If I don't visit the IMDb page I feel\u000aincomplete. If I don't participate with the fellow Shawshankers on\u000aIMDb...I feel INCOMPLETE.This brings happiness to my soul deep inside. Brings a smile to my\u000aface. People can say what they want about clichés, and cheesy moments\u000abut I don't care. This movie stirs the soul and if somebody can\u000aactually HATE something like this...then your not human.This movie shows....in every circumstance, that GOOD always prevails\u000aover evil. I don't want to spoil it for those of you who haven't seen\u000ait, but Redemption is a great thing.We have all been through pain in our lives, and if you haven't...you\u000awill. This movie gives you tremendous hope. You will get far in life,\u000aif you stick by that word...HOPE."When you walk through a storm, hold your head up high. At the end of\u000athe storm there's a golden sky.Walk on through the wind. Walk on through the rain. Though your dreams\u000abe tossed & blown. Walk on, Walk on. With 'HOPE' in your heart...and\u000ayou'll NEVER walk alone" No matter what you've been through, you can\u000aget through it and become a stronger person. You can literally have\u000afeces all over you but you will STILL be clean. Watch it and you will\u000aknow what i'm talking about.If you haven't seen this, then you don't and will never understand life\u000atruly.Just watch it, and watch out for the memorable acting from Morgan\u000aFreeman and Tim Robbins.They don't make movies like this anymore......\u000a

V\u000aWord of mouth alone has turned this modest prison movie into something\u000aof a classic and there are many people who rate it as their favourite\u000afilm. It's what's probably conventionally called 'a man's picture' but\u000athere are many women who love it, too. And there is no denying it's a\u000agood tale well told. There is nothing ostentatious about it. It's\u000awriter/director Frank Darabont was new to movies and he didn't do\u000aanything out of the ordinary. He structured the film like a forties or\u000afifties film; old fashioned, traditional and likable, but not a great\u000amovie by any means.And yet it has scenes that stay in the memory and which people recall\u000afondly, (even if they are very brutal), and dialogue which sounds\u000afamiliar. Unfortunately, early in the film there is a clip from "Gilda"\u000athat is more iconic than anything in Darabont's film. (Sometimes homage\u000acan be detrimental to a film).Tim Robbins is fine as Andy, the young banker in Shawshank for the\u000amurder of his wife and her lover, (the film basically confirmed his\u000astar-status), but it is Morgan Freeman who walks away with the film\u000awith a quietly magnificent performance as Red, the old timer who\u000abefriends Andy and who is the film's narrator. Freeman gives the film a\u000adignity and gravitas it really doesn't deserve.\u000a

V\u000aThis is probably one of the best films of all time.IMDb ranks this as\u000athe second best film of all time behind "The Godfather".It can arguably\u000abe the best film of all time considering that its message of hope and\u000ainspiration to everyone.It is a short story from Stephen King.The Shawshank Redemption is a poignant story of Andy Dufresne,a wrongly\u000aconvicted killer who was sent for two life sentences to Shawshank\u000aPrison in Maine.It tells us on how Andy lived inside the walls of the\u000aShawshank,being raped from time to time by convicted homosexuals\u000afelons,his friendship with Red,having a sense of hope despite of his\u000aseemly hopeless situation,making the most of his life by using his\u000aaccounting skills by helping the guards in their income tax and\u000acleaning the warden's dirty money and to finally escaping from prison\u000athrough a hole in the wall hidden under poster of women such as Rita\u000aHayworth and Rachel Welsh.Great acting especially by Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman.Direction was\u000asuperb by first time director Frank Darabont.The musical score was also\u000agood.I view this film from time to time to remind myself that there is\u000ahope in all situations even those I consider hopeless ones.It also a\u000astory of letting go of hatred and letting love flow into your heart\u000adespite of being around despicable characters.Aside from that,this film is neither contrived nor manipulative as it\u000ais full of surprises.It will truly be enjoyed by anybody who love great\u000afilms and those who wants films that can truly uplift the human\u000aspirit.In the end,this movie will be talked about for the next 20 to 50\u000aor more years to come.Personally it my favorite film of more than a\u000athousand films I seen in my life for it is a classic film on hope and\u000aredemption.\u000a

V\u000aI saw this movie mainly because it was rated so highly in IMDb. It was\u000aa decent movie but it should not be number 2. It has Morgan Freeman and\u000ahis wonderful voice so that's certainly a plus. The messages of the bad\u000aguys getting it in the end is nice as well as keeping one's hope alive\u000ain adverse circumstances. I didn't really think the gestapo like guard,\u000awho is able to kill anyone on a whim, was very believable. Even\u000aconvicted felons have loved ones who would want answers. Besides,\u000aguards know that one day the tables may be turned on them and this\u000ausually tempers their cruelty. Vicious guards are usually "dealt with"\u000aby the inmates, so I don't believe a guard like this could last long,\u000aand certainly not over 20 years. And how is it that the warden and\u000achief guard are in the same job at the same prison for over 20 years? I\u000adon't really buy the massive kickbacks the warden was getting\u000acontinuously either. Prison labor in the USA usually involve trash\u000apicking, farming & soap making for institutional use and license plate\u000astamping. These are not highly profitable industries. Neither was I too\u000athrilled by the subtle cynicism aimed at the Bible and those who read\u000ait. Lots of convicts "get religion" and it is generally a good thing.\u000aAlso, the quick series of mini-scenes leading me by the hand through\u000athe resolution (baptism by sewage, screaming headlines, screaming\u000asirens, arrests and suicide) seemed fairytale like. At least you can\u000asay that the movie raises awareness of the fact that there are wrongly\u000aconvicted people in prison and that savage inmates beat and rape each\u000aother. I did like the demeanor of the main character, Andy, our victim\u000acum hero. A mix of being quiet, brooding, deliberate, cautious,\u000awillful, sly and subdued. This is a nobler hero than what you see in\u000amany Hollywood movies. And Morgan's performance as Red reminds us that,\u000afelon or not, inmates are still quite capable of humanity. So in\u000ageneral, I didn't mind watching this movie. It entertained me. I just\u000awouldn't include it in my list of best movies. I would not want to\u000awatch it again.\u000a

V\u000aTim Robbins and Morgan Freeman deliver performances worthy of cinematic\u000aheaven. No where do we spot the intention of their performances, only\u000athe gradual development of a friendship that transcends race, age, and\u000asocial class.The line between guilty and innocent, although blurred amongst the\u000ainmates, is animated by the corrupt guards, and the abysmal treatment\u000aof men who have sand piles on their weary shoulders.Redemption is the predominate theme, as well as perseverance and\u000afriendship through situation. Biblical undertones pervade: Robbins\u000abears oppression that angers the viewers until the redemptive secret is\u000arevealed.The institution, the jail, as metaphor for society often succeeds. The\u000a"instituional man" cannot survive beyond the social structure behind\u000athe walls. He is a lost soul without the community of thieves and\u000amurderers that defines his existence. What is a man, but a success\u000aamongst his peers? One of the best films of the twentieth century.\u000a

V\u000aI remember when I first watched this film being surprised at how highly\u000aregarded it was by my work colleagues (and by many other people too),\u000aso I must have missed the point. Can someone really dig his way out of\u000aprison in the manner that "our hero" did? I thought there was generally\u000aa policy that people were moved around from cell to cell over time; and\u000awhat about the suspect premise that he was able to keep his escape\u000atunnel hidden with posters - which no-one ever checked behind! How did\u000ahe keep them in place whilst he was in the tunnel? How did he dispose\u000aof the material he dug out? Surely it's all too far-fetched. Am I being too pedantic; should I\u000areally just be acknowledging the film's uplifting storyline? Some\u000apeople I spoke with told me that it was based on a true story - it's\u000anot .On balance, I far preferred Mr King's "The Green Mile".\u000a

V\u000aAfter just seeing this,i have to say i think its one of the best\u000aadaptations of a Stephen King story.And one of the few films that can\u000abe called a "moden classic". The Plot:After the police in Maine find the bodies of a married woman and her\u000alover,who were shot eight times.They bring in the married woman's\u000ahusband.A hot-shot banker Andy Dufren(Tim"The Mystic River" Robbins)\u000a.Who clams that he is not guilty.At the end of the case,Andy is found\u000aguilty and given two life sentences at Shawshank prison Maine.When he\u000ais first there he is very closed off from everyone.And has fights with\u000aa prison group called "The Sisters".Until he tells a guard how to keep\u000amoney from a will.While in there,he gets the trust of the guards and\u000athe warden and builds a strong friendship with a black marketeer named\u000aRed(played fantastically by Morgan"The Dreamcatcher,The\u000aSe7ven"Freeman).Things are going well,till an inmate Tommy,tells\u000aAndy,that in a prison he was in,he met the man who did the murder Andys\u000ain Shawshank for.The warden,who thinks Tommy is to much of a risk for\u000ahis money business due to Andy doing all work for him),so he kills\u000aTommy.After this,Andy decides its time he gets out of Shawshank.View on\u000athe film:The cast. This is one of the rare films,where all the cast just click\u000ainto there roles.The two leads Robbins and Freeman,who give some of\u000athere best work in this film.The way they work and build there\u000afriendship in the film,that is sadly rarely seen in any movies.The\u000asupporting characters in the film do a really good job at standing out\u000aand not feeling like they are just card-board cut outs.The main one in\u000athe supporting cast that stand out is James Whitmore as Brooks.who\u000amakes a very enjoyable characters,who you feel very sad,to see go out\u000ain a very sad way.The Screenply/Direction.Wirter/director Frank"The\u000aGreen Mile" Darabont (who made a student-film based on a King short\u000astory:The Woman in the Red Room),does a screenplay that easily improves\u000aon the short story.While Kings short story spent (i feel) a bit to much\u000atime on the exposition in his story,while Darabont makes sure to keep\u000athe set-up going at a good pace,and to tighten some of the story\u000alines(Brooks was hardly in the short story,Tommy was not killed).But he\u000amakes sure to keep the feel of the story so they do not feel as strange\u000aadd-ons to the story.The direction the Darabont does is to make sure to\u000asee the actors work build in the scenes,while doing a good job at\u000akeeping the film going at a pace that does not feel over-long\u000a(something that is rare with movies now). Final view on the film:A movie anyone can enjoy,from age 18-80!\u000a

V\u000aThis is by no means a bad movie, but it's certainly not as great as\u000amany people claim. I have watched it a couple of times already now and\u000aI just don't see what's so brilliant about it. The story is good, but\u000anot excellent. The acting of the biggest part of the cast is good, but\u000aI really can't identify myself with Andy, the main character. He is\u000asentenced to life imprisonment, while being innocent. Though, he just\u000adoesn't do it for me. You would expect me to feel sympathy for him,\u000abecause of his situation. To a certain degree I do of course, as I do\u000awith anyone who is done injustice. But that is not enough, that's why I\u000athink this movie is overrated.\u000a

V\u000aOne of the most satisfying movies ever. Anyone who has seen this film\u000ais being gradually overwhelmed by the injustice towards a single man;\u000aand while the scenario unfolds a grim, but also an unpredictable\u000afuture, the hero reveals at the end his so far unrealistic stance in\u000aeverything inside the prison. Redemption is not a utopia on this film.\u000aA scarce thing to see in the majority of today's movies. It perfectly\u000areflects an every day person's point of view in assessing things and\u000ahis life by "get busy living or get busy dying". And although it\u000acontains some dramatic characters, it gives the final sensation to the\u000aaudience that hope can really change things, no matter the costs\u000ainvolved. A sensation that is amiss from today's movies, which try to\u000apresent a realistic ending or character. Movies were not made to be\u000atotally realistic and this movie proves it magically.\u000a

V\u000aFirst of all i enjoyed this film immensely. It was well shot, highly\u000aemotive and contained two great lead performances, but the fact remains\u000athat this movie is perhaps too overrated in the grand scheme of cinema.It must not be forgotten that this film is an adaptation of a short\u000astory and as such the narrative requires a little more depth. One\u000ashould also take into account the film's cult status as a sleeper hit\u000a(which never the less underlines its definite quality) as reason to be\u000acynical over its actual significance in American popular cinema.However, the film is undoubtedly one of the finest examples of the\u000aprison genre, certainly ranking alongside the likes of Cool Hand Luke.\u000aThe relationship of the main protagonists is perhaps one of the reasons\u000afor this as is the movies themes and contextual references. As a result\u000athis is a fine picture which inspires its audience to question justice\u000aand honour in a non too clichéd way.\u000a

V\u000aIn every way, this film is an affirmation of faith; not simply\u000areligious faith, but faith of any kind. In no other way has a film of\u000asuch simple storytelling been so well received nor powerful. At the\u000asame time, there is a measure of realism here not seen many other\u000ahighly-praised movies. The Godfather, The Return of the King, The Seven Samurai; all\u000aincredible movies, but the one flaw residing over all three is this: In\u000avery little ways are the protagonists in these true-to-life. A Mafia\u000aDon, a would-be King, warriors of old - they are larger than life; they\u000ahave a quality to them that raises them above all others - and the\u000afilms, thus, retain a quality in the realm of the fantastic that sully\u000athe realism they wish to portray.The Shawshank Redemption is not in the like. Not one of the characters\u000acould be called "larger than life;" in no way are any of the characters\u000a"good" or "evil" - the boundary is so grayed that it no longer exists;\u000athey're simply human, with sins, hopes, loves, and fears. In a way no\u000aother film has ever been able to, Shawshank perfectly reflects a story\u000aof humanity and hope. It comes to be that we do not begin to see these\u000apeople as characters, but begin to think as they do, to become them.If you really want to see a film of limitless power and beauty, a film\u000athat you truly become delved into, with characters that you feel\u000aperfect sympathy and empathy towards, The Shawshank Redemption is it.\u000a

V\u000aIt took me 10 years to see this movie; I dated a guy who constantly\u000atalked about it 7 years ago; but I never did see it. I am not into\u000aprison movies; so I kept telling him I didn't want to see it. Whenever\u000ait came on television, I would go into another room and watch something\u000aelse. I just thought he liked it because he has been in prison before;\u000aand it reminded him of being in there or something (silly me).But, this Labor Day Weekend (2005); when it came on again; I decided to\u000asit down and just look at it for the first time. Well; was I pleasantly\u000asurprised and glad that I did finally see it. Great plot, good\u000adirection, characters that had some depth and the surprise ending too\u000aboot. Also, just to be able to see Morgan Freeman act is a treat me for\u000aanyway; he is such a great actor. He finally won the Academy Award that\u000ahe so richly deserved all of these years for Million Dollar Baby. He\u000agot robbed of the Academy Award for "Driving Ms. Daisy" and for "Lean\u000aon Me"; but he finally got what was due him.I also liked Tim Robbins portrayal of his character, as he was quiet,\u000aand smart. You know, being quiet sometimes can help a person get\u000athrough many difficult ordeals in their life. Folks have a tendency to\u000aignore you and don't pay much attention to you then. I learned how to\u000abe quiet and not so loud all the time; thinking is better than talking\u000ain certain situations.Before I saw this move, I was not being treated well at work by my\u000aboss, and struggling with how to handle it. Seeing this movie actually\u000ahelped me to do something positive about it. My boss and my job will\u000anever be the same.Andy was right; we need to get along with the business of living or the\u000abusiness of dying; and living is much better.P.S. I broke up with the guy I was dating 7 years ago; he was a jerk.Sanctified Minister Chicago, IL\u000a

V\u000aLike many of the reviewers, I hate prison movies with all the clichés\u000aand stereotypes of innocent prisoners, nasty guards, and evil wardens;\u000aand upon first viewing, many years ago, I especially disliked being\u000aforced by this film to feel sympathy and empathy with murderers,\u000arapists and the like.Shawshank has somehow transcended the test of time; and I believe that\u000ait has endured, not because of the great performances (which don't seem\u000ato be acting at all, but real), not because of the simple, but\u000amulti-level, story line with its twists and turns, not because of its\u000amagnificent photography, not because of its score, and not because of\u000aany individual element that went into the making of this film. (Hence,\u000athe lack of academy awards.) However, when all those elements are\u000acombined, Shawshank becomes one of those masterpieces which is greater\u000athan the sum of its parts...and this film is so much greater that in\u000athe desperation of its characters, it invokes a multitude of good\u000aemotions in the viewer...that there is divine, poetic justice and hope\u000ain this hell of a world.Shawshank has become my favorite film of all time, but it took a while.\u000a"When your're feeling down and out, watch Shawshank!" Raising my vote\u000afrom 8/10 to 10/10 (however subjective that vote may be.)\u000a

V\u000aMaybe the best American movie of the 90's. No Oscar for this picture.\u000aMaybe too much good to win any prize. Frank Darabont's masterpiece is a\u000aperfect example of classical movie: without pretentious direction,\u000awithout f/x, without a great budget... "Only" a wonderful story, a\u000abrilliant soundtrack (Thomas Newman already existed before American\u000aBeauty), a message about hope, and two monsters of the acting: Morgan\u000aFreeman and Tim Robbins, Red and Andy Dufresne. I didn't think a film\u000abased on a Stephen King book could be so fascinating, so sensitive, so\u000awonderful.Enough to stay in your mind forever, and enough to cheer you up\u000awhenever you feel down.Rating: 10/10\u000a

V\u000aWhen you get two life sentences, maybe you are in total despair\u000aespecially you are innocent. But the banker Andy was not. He still had\u000aa hope for his future. He thought every possible way to get out of the\u000aprison. When the hope that recovered his innocence openly broke out, he\u000adecided to escape from the prison with his way. He was quite a smart\u000aperson. Even his friend Red did not know his escape plan. He did it. So\u000aRed too. Their reunion at the beach was the warmest scene in the movie.Although the movie got many academy nominees, it got nothing in the\u000aend. However it won the heart of people. I think that its positive\u000aconnotation is enough to move every one. That is why it is still so\u000apopular after 11 years. We should not abandon hope at any circumstance.\u000aWithout hope, without future.Tim Robbins convincingly played the sympathizing banker. His another\u000aimpressive movie was The player. Morgan Freeman should have won the\u000aacademy award. If that happened, he did not have to wait 11 years to\u000aget the award (best supporting actor for Million dollar baby).A movie can bring you hope. 8/10\u000a

V\u000awhy is this movie considered a classic....someone please make a\u000areasonable argument to explain this.I've seen it several times and my\u000aopinion of it remains the same. nothing special about the\u000adirection,cinematography is only OK, acting is good, screenplay is\u000ainferior to an already average short story (film is nearly 3 hrs\u000along....totally up its own anus) and it contains every prison film\u000acliché in the book. people like it because of its triumph over\u000aadversity theme (man winning against impossible odds, human spirit\u000aunbroken......zzzzzzzzzzzz) its been done b4 especially in Hollywood\u000aand much better (cuckoos nest).this AVERAGE movie has got to be near\u000athe top of the list of most overrated films ever made.\u000a

V\u000aThis was the first movie that I remember as a little kid. When I saw\u000ait, i was captivated by the perfect acting of Tim Robbins and Morgan\u000aFreeman. I thought all the prisoners were actually prisoners serving\u000alife sentences. It was the first Steven King movie I've ever seen, and\u000ait gave me the wrong impression about his type of movies.The movie is about Andy Dufresne (Tim Robbins) who is convicted of\u000amurdering his wife and the man she was having an affair with. Andy is\u000asent to jail were he tries to survive a new life behind bars. The movie\u000ashows his struggles with the inmates and prison officials. His closest\u000afriend being Red (Morgan Freeman) also shares those same struggles as\u000aAndy. And the movie has the most powerful ending of any movie I've ever\u000aseen.I can say that everyone that has seen this movie truly loves it for\u000aevery aspect of it. The Acting, directing, and writing, etc.\u000a

V\u000aThe Shawshank redemption is the first Frank Darabont's movie which has\u000ataken 7 Oscar-nominations from the Academy but the film not yielded a\u000ahigh profit.Why not? Well,the story of this movie is too good to be\u000atrue.The Shawshank redemption is based on the book by Stephen King and\u000acertainly this is the most brilliant adaptation which has ever based\u000afrom the writer'novels. The playtime is rather long but seems to be not\u000aboring.It's excellently produced,and the acting(Tim Robbins and\u000aespecially Morgan Freeman)is marvellous.The script is clever enough\u000aabout the human's relationships and the escape from the prison.The\u000acharacters and the story itself are clearly true.\u000a

V\u000aFor quite some time, I've been hearing how good The Shawshank\u000aRedemption is. But Unfortunately, I never got the chance to see it.\u000aAfter seeing it last week, I can safely say that the movie lives to the\u000ahype, it even exceeds it.The Shawshank Redemption tells the story of Andy Dufresne ( Tim Robbins\u000a), a hotshot banker who's convicted of murdering his wife and his\u000alover, and who's sent to jail. In the prison, Andy meets Red ( Morgan\u000aFreeman ), a " man who knows how to get things ". And a friendship\u000abegins between them.There are many great aspects about the movie. I'll begin with the most\u000aobvious one, the uplifting tone. When The Shawshank Redemption ended, I\u000awas so happy I cried happy tears, I was never happier after watching a\u000amovie.The story of the movie is so simple, yet it's very touching and\u000aeffective. We spend almost half the movie watching 2 men ( Andy & Red\u000a), talking and walking in the prison yard. Slowly we get to know them\u000abetter, and in the meantime absolutely fall in love with them. I think\u000afriendship was never portrayed better in movies.One of the best things about the movie is the acting. Morgan Freeman\u000awas never better in my opinion, Tim Robbins gave a very good\u000aperformance, but I think he was better in The Player, and the\u000asupporting cast ( Bob Gunton, William Sadler, and Gil Bellows ) was\u000apretty good too.Frank Darabont's directing is flawless. He was able to make us believe\u000awe're watching a real prison, helped in that by the great\u000acinematography. He excelled in creating the right mood for both the\u000auplifting scenes ( the opera scene, the library scenes ) and the\u000adepressing scenes ( the scenes with Brooks, and the rape scene ). It\u000aseems Darabont is at his best when he's making movies set in prisons,\u000aas evidenced by The Shawshank Redemption and The Green Mile. When he\u000atried to change that in The Majestic, the results were so-so.So, I definitely recommend watching The Shawshank Redemption, if you\u000ahaven't watched it already. This is truly one of the best movies ever\u000amade.\u000a

V\u000aOrdinarily, I would run a mile from a film like this. But this is a\u000afilm that has such a reputation, such a myth about it, that trying to\u000ahate "The Shawshank Redemption" is like trying to slap a nun - you just\u000acan't bring yourself to do it. It is incredibly powerful and emotive\u000astuff, despite the predictability of it all. My only concern was that\u000aafter so much had been said over the years that it might fail to live\u000aup to my sky-high expectations. Forget about it - this is a film that\u000aexceeds them. Imagine "Cool Hand Luke" but with a better ending. Yes,\u000athis is that good.Tim Robbins excels as Andy Dufresne, a mild-mannered banker who is\u000ajailed for the murder of his wife and her lover. Sentenced to two life\u000asentences in Shawshank Prison, he slowly develops a friendship with\u000afellow lifer Red (an outstanding Morgan Freeman). And despite the\u000aefforts of the prison guards and fellow inmates, Andy refuses to lose\u000ahope and soon, Andy's stay in Shawshank touches the lives of those who\u000alive and work there forever.It's difficult to pin down exactly what makes "The Shawshank\u000aRedemption" such an instant classic. Maybe it's the scene in the\u000awarden's (Bob Gunton) office where Andy plays opera through the jail's\u000asound system to everybody. Maybe it's rebellious Sixties jailbird Tommy\u000a(Gil Bellows) and his efforts to learn how to read as Andy teaches him.\u000aPerhaps it's the way the guards turn from being aggressive to being\u000aco-operative with Andy, who helps them fill out their tax return forms.\u000aThe simple truth is that in spite of the long winded story, you cannot\u000atear yourself away from the screen for a minute. Robbins and Freeman\u000aare utterly captivating as the two men struggling with life behind\u000abars, both with very different approaches to how to never give up hope.\u000aRarely does a film engage the viewer in such a way as it does here -\u000aafter all, we're rooting for convicted murderers here - but you cannot\u000ahelp but be caught up in the story. And towards the fabulous ending,\u000ayou begin to feel better about yourself - regardless of how hacked off\u000ayou are and I was when I threw the DVD in.Although Robbins and Freeman deliver an acting masterclass, the\u000asupporting cast do a fantastic job. Bellows, Gunton, William Sadler (as\u000aanother lifer) and James Whitmore as the old librarian Brooks are all\u000asuperb. Gunton is especially brilliant, at times repulsive and\u000aloathsome - a proper villain. The scenery is also top-quality - the\u000aprison walls in dull greys and the world beyond the walls lit up in\u000aglorious summery yellows and greens. I really cannot praise this film\u000aenough! Director Frank Darabont will never produce a better film than\u000athis, which is by a country mile the best Steven King adaptation to hit\u000ascreens. In fact, what are you still doing here reading this? Grab a\u000afist full of notes, go into town and buy yourself a copy now. This\u000ainstant. Don't worry about me, I won't mind!\u000a

V\u000aI can't believe I waited 11 years to see this film. I often saw\u000acommercials advertising the film on TNT, but never had enough interest\u000ato sit and watch until I bought the movie for my fiancée. I'm so glad I\u000afinally got to see this film. This is easily one of the greatest films\u000aof all time. I couldn't believe the outstanding job done by all of the\u000aactors. I've seen very few scripts on the level of this one, but have\u000anever seen so many strong performances from the entire cast.Morgan Freeman is incredible as Red and narrates the action better than\u000aany other voice-over I've ever heard. I was very surprised with Tim\u000aRobbins. For some reason I still thought of him as Nuke Laloosh and\u000anever dreamed he had this kind of acting ability. The story is\u000aincredible and the dialogue keeps the entire film rolling. Two and a\u000ahalf hours go by like nothing. I also have to applaud William Sadler,\u000awho showed great versatility (watch Bill & Ted's Bogus Journey or Die\u000aHard 2 to see what I mean). The film is intriguing as well as inspiring\u000aat the same time. I found myself inwardly cheering for Andy to escape\u000afrom Shawshank and was even happy when he is shown emerging from the\u000asewer tunnel. His reunion with Red is almost tearjerking. The movie\u000amanaged to have a happy ending without it seeming to be another\u000aunrealistic Hollywood Ending.This film is definitely a must-see. I have seen Braveheart, and though\u000aI thought it was fantastic it doesn't come anywhere near the power of\u000aShawshank Redemption. I doubt another cast ensemble of incredible\u000aacting talent will ever match this one. Easily a 10 on the IMDb.com\u000ascale.\u000a

V\u000aThe first time i read about this movie, I was sure that this movie is\u000aoverrated, But after seeing him, I am sure that this movie is\u000aunderrated It is the best movie ever. It is about hope, passion, love\u000aand friendship. I do not think that Hollywood can produce an other\u000amovie like that, it one in century. The acting was GENIUS, The script\u000awas the best ever, The director was a maestro. A lot of Novel-Moivis\u000anot good as the novel, I did not read Stephen King's Novel, but I am\u000asure that the movie is much better. believe me if you saw the movie you\u000awill not be able to forget it. Believe me when I say that you will not\u000aable to talk after seeing the movie at least for 20 minutes, and the\u000afirst thing you will say 'Why this sons of bitches did not give it Best\u000aMotion Picture'.

V\u000aThis is the greatest film ever made ..... bar none! It has everything\u000ayou could ever want in a film and more! The story is quite different to\u000athe short story by Stephen King but thats not necessarily a bad thing\u000aas the Green Mile followed the book closely and wasn't nearly as good\u000aas this! It says if you can to think of a film to compare it to but its\u000ain a genre all of its own. Other good prison films I could suggest are\u000a"Against the Wall" and "Killer: A Journal of Murder". Both of these are\u000agood but lack the depth of characters portrayed in Shawshank. For a\u000agood prison televisual drama then "Oz" has to be the best thing to come\u000aout of America after the Simpsons, it has the characters and plots to\u000amatch Shawshank but generally without the feel good factor thrown in.\u000a

V\u000aThis film gave me a great feeling at the end. My mother thought it\u000awouldn't be my typical everyday action movie, I saw the recommendations\u000aand had a look at it. I was amazed, and so was my mum. At the end I saw\u000aher on the edge of her seat yelling at Morgan Freeman to do what Tim\u000aRobbins had said.I recommend this movie very much. It is a sad, funny at times and it is\u000amost importantly, Heart warming. For those of you that haven't seen it\u000aI tell you now, this is the best movie of the Nineties.Just another thing, I saw Forrest Gump and that was not as good as\u000athis. The Shawshank Redemption should have won the Oscars!\u000a

V\u000aI look at many of the contenders that would be the most marvellous\u000amovies ever made and can only be more reassured of this film's true\u000astatus as the absolute pinnacle of what Hollywood has tried to portray\u000aover the past century. This film (as many greats), was originally\u000aignored by critics even shunned.So we should ask what actually makes a good film..., what makes the\u000aperfect movie???? Well, the answer in three words is .... 'The\u000aShawshank Redemption'. This film was originally put down because it was\u000anot the best filmed or best acted etc., but overall it is better than\u000a'ANYTHING' ever before and the benchmark for all that followed. I can't\u000aimagine a movie lover who would dismiss any notion that his or her life\u000awas made slightly better by this film (YES REALLY IT IS THAT GOOD).The Godfather films even The lord of the rings are enormous cinematic\u000atriumphs, but for me the measure of a film is in how it tells a story,\u000aand how it leaves you feeling at the end. I can't imagine any narcotic\u000athat could rouse you in the same way as this would should you be\u000aviewing for the first time.A simple story of a middle class young man, imprisoned for killing his\u000awife in an unforgiving fortress, left with nothing but his intelligence\u000aand his strength of heart. Through his relationships with his inmates,\u000aand his ability to survive we walk every step with Andy until we\u000afinally witness the genius of ..... "The Shawshank Redemption" If you\u000ahaven't seen this you are so unbelievably lucky to be able to\u000aexperience it for the first time.The best and most 'need to see' film ever made.11/10\u000a

V\u000aFreedom and brave ¡°Birds need air, human need freedom!" If you lose\u000afreedom in your life, you imagine what you can do? Maybe your world is\u000agrey; you can¡¯t control your behavior. That is too awful and\u000amiserable!Andy is a good sample, he is a young and clever banker, and he was\u000asentenced because he killed his wife, but he did not do that in fact,\u000ahe have to stay at the boring prison at last. The truth is so cruel!\u000aAndy is brave person, I admired him very much. He did a good job for the minister of prison nearly twenty years, with\u000aa place mood and tastiest. This is not easy. Under this badly\u000aenvironment, how can keep a place mood? Maybe most of people can not do\u000athat.Andy had a great plan when he came into the prison. He did not plan to\u000astay here in all his life. He must war with his freedom. He dipped a\u000along road about 500 yards. The road stands for his freedom and hope.\u000aRod is his good friend, and helps him a lot.Shawshank Redemption is a good film. I got a lot from it. First,\u000aeveryone is free, don¡¯t be controlled by others, you have your ideas\u000aand behavior. Second, don¡¯t give up your courage; face the truth with\u000ayour braveness. No one can help you, but yourself. Third, if you want\u000ato succeed, the courage, strengthen tastiest and place mood.\u000a

V\u000aThis movie became my favorite movie of all time, before i had even seen\u000athe whole thing. Has this happened to anyone else? I had seen parts on\u000aTV and that was it. The day i finally rented it, i was practically\u000ajittery with excitement. This just tells you about my unique subjective\u000aexperience with it. After it was over, I wasn't dissatisfied in the\u000aleast. It is truly a great film all around. It is one of those things\u000awhere part of me wants everyone in the world to see it, but another\u000apart of me feels like my personal experience with it makes it my own. I\u000adon't want to write an extensive review and put it under some kind of\u000alens and analyze it. I'll just say that from that day forward, The\u000aShawshank Redemption had profoundly affected the way I view movies and\u000ait his been the gateway into my current passion for films.\u000a

V\u000aSomebody said that life as fence, those who are inside want to leave,\u000awhile those who are outside wanted to go inside. There are also have\u000aanother kind of man who satisfied with the about circumstance and\u000aeasily become victim. Lu Xun, a very famous writer in china said: If\u000ayou don¡¯t uprising in silent, you will die in it. The Shawshank Redemption, Andy is a man who satisfied with the about\u000acircumstance: Through his strong abstention, he didn¡¯t shoot his wife\u000awhen he found her betray; Through his strong will, the first night in\u000ajail, which full of fear and dark, he had a narrow escape from death;\u000aThrough his sturdy resistance, he didn¡¯t yield to force and join in\u000athe dark organization. At the same time, he also was a man didn¡¯t\u000asatisfied with the about circumstance: his brave exchange a box of beer\u000afor his friends and gain a strong shield; his never give up made the\u000ajail library had the first class equipment; his was severely punished\u000abring the wonderful music to the jail where nearly forgot by angel.Everything passed in silent. Dark hair turned to white; adult became\u000aold man. The kindly librarian killed himself after he was set free. It\u000aseems just the other prisoner¡¯s fate .Silent, everyone hesitate to how\u000ato continue their lives. Andy gave the insensible and perplexed\u000aprisoners a reason of relive. Sun , sands, sea ¡­¡­ overthrow the\u000aviolence of political power.I remember there is a kind of bird , she use her hold life time to find\u000aout a kind of thorn tree . when, thorn of tree pierce the bird of heart\u000a, she will sing the most wonderful music in her life until died.How beautiful life is when in freedom.\u000a

V\u000aAndy, he is my the most admire character, and he is the man who own the\u000aspirit, that I searching for a long time. I think that as long as I has\u000athe spirit like his, I was success a half, so I will going on to this\u000aaim.The Shawshank Redemption is a prison movie about Andy Dufresne (Tim\u000aRobbins), a man being charged with the murder of his wife and her lover\u000aand is consequently sent to Shawshank prison on two life sentences.\u000aYear after year, Andy faces more and more adversity, victimized by\u000aruthless prison guards and malicious inmates, but combining his\u000amentality, courage, determination and spirit, as well as his close\u000afriendship with veteran inmate Red (Morgan Freeman), Andy's journey\u000abecomes an utterly unforgettable one.The reason Shawshank is so good is because it's so incredibly moving\u000aand powerful. Up until the very last minute, you're drawn tightly\u000atowards the screen witnessing, step by step, Andy's growth in Shawshank\u000aprison. The acting is sublime, the dialogue is intelligent, the story\u000ais inspirational, the cinematography is breathtaking and every other\u000alittle detail is done to maximum superiority.Above all, is my comment about this movie, and I hope have a\u000acommunicate with you on the movie.\u000a

V\u000aSpoiler Alert Shawshank Redemption hit the movie world in 1994.It\u000atouched the hearts of the filmgoers like no other movie.It is no longer\u000ajust a movie but has become a vivid legend .I love this movie very\u000amuch, it is the story of a lifetime.It tells a story that Andy\u000aCoufresne, a banker ,who has been convicted falsely of murdering his\u000awife and her lover.But he never lost his faith to be innocent\u000aagain.Through two turbulent decades of his life in jail,viewing the\u000adarkness of jail and the coldness of the world.He learnt to deal with\u000aloneliness ,desperation ,unfairness.Exactlly,Andy is the embodiment of\u000aan era, an innocent at large in a world that is losing its innocent.But\u000ahis irony strength and kindness known what he could.Armed with his high\u000aIQ ,irnoy will and kind nature to versus the world's cruelty.I admire\u000ahis strong character and faith,Andy is a person of great\u000adetermination,who is burdering the greatest insult and facing the\u000afallen from a freeman to a personier.No one can see the beauty of the\u000aworld and touch the gender of the sunshine but Andy.The movie give the inspiration to us all and a sense of the redemption\u000ain our soul.In this movie ,friendship is also brilliant,Red ,a black,\u000aAndy , a white, they communicated from the bottom of the heart to corss\u000athe racial discrimination.At the end of the movie,we can see that they\u000aembrace warmthly by the seashore .A prefect ending in the background\u000awith blue sea and white sky.Everything is in harmony ,as beautiful as a\u000arainbow after storm."Hope is a good thing,maybe the best of the\u000athings,no good thing ever dies." Andy said to us. This is a kind of\u000aspirit we need in our way to be self-esteem.All in all,Shawshank\u000aRedemption is the movie we need in our lifetime.\u000a

V\u000a"The Shawshank Redemption" is not a depressing story, although I may\u000ahave made it sound that way. There is a lot of life and humor in it,\u000aand warmth in the friendship that builds up between Andy and Red. There\u000ais even excitement and suspense, although not when we expect it. But\u000amostly the film is an allegory about holding onto a sense of personal\u000aworth, despite everything. If the film is perhaps a little slow in its\u000amiddle passages, maybe that is part of the idea, too, to give us a\u000asense of the leaden passage of time, before the glory of the final\u000aredemption.All in all, I think it is a very good film and worthy everybody to\u000awatch it, the most important sentences ¡°Hope is a good thing, maybe\u000athe best of things, No good thing ever dies.¡± It is really make us\u000athinking deeply, and another one which was said by Red, he said that\u000athere has one kind of birds that you could never keep him in the cage,\u000abecause every feather of his body was covered by the brilliance of\u000afreedom. I think everyone should remember this, everyone of us are\u000acovered by some brilliance of our own, we should never give up no\u000amatter how difficult it is! And we should remember that ¡°hope is a\u000agood thing¡± ,we should have hopes for all our lives!--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\u000a

V\u000aShaw shank Redemption,is the best movie I have ever seen,which is\u000adifferent from common Hollywood story .The story is not complex ,\u000alacking of moving scenes which could be seen in many Hollywood stories\u000a.The director devotes to carefully picture the figures.It is the\u000acuriousness of the fate of Andy and Red that causes my interests. Andy\u000aif under a very awful situation.He is educated and thin , falling into\u000aa environment full of into violence ,if no painfulness and\u000aill-treatment,it would be quite usual .Upon being put into prison,he\u000afirstly is a violence-taker.As an audience,at the very beginning,I\u000acould not tell Andy is not a murder,and hard to judge whether the\u000aadversities he gets are deserved.It is not a good element for\u000arecognition of a figure.The director solved this problem through\u000aRed¡¯voice incredibly.Voice out of the scene is to help narrator to\u000acomplete the content which the pictures could not\u000adelivery.Especially,this movie is such long-lasting and large-contented\u000aone that needs voice out of movie so as to help us set up the\u000arecognition of Andy.Though the story by the time does not show how much\u000agood Andy has,we have liked him.When Andy helping the bad prison\u000apoliceman,I did not blame the deed he did morally,but glad to see his\u000asituation turning well. With the emotional narration of Red,we could\u000asee more and more good form the inside of Andy.He relies on his\u000aknowledge and persistence, even regardless of the punish of being throw\u000ainto a locked room, bringing knowledge ,music,not just spiritual\u000achange, but the hope of life .We also know that Andy is virtually\u000ainnocent, when being informed that the president of prison letting the\u000aunjustic case of Andy alone instead of killing Tommy who is only one\u000acould proof Andy innocent. By the time, the audience tend to stand at\u000athe side of Andy and be angry with the innocent prison life of Andy.\u000aAndy finally escapes from the prison and takes away all the money from\u000athe president of the prison with illegal method.But no one is\u000aunhappy.This movie has a classical Hollywood end,but I do not think it\u000ais common, because I am fascinated by the story and hope to see such\u000aending .It is the charm of Hollywood.\u000a

V\u000aLike picasso,chaplin and the beatles the sycophantic veneration of this\u000a"icon" is a complete mystery.Its a decent film - but it certainly isn't\u000aa great one,its no better than escape from alcatraz,brubaker,i escaped\u000afrom a chain gang, but that doesn't matter to the cinematic lemmings\u000avainly looking for prestige and kudos about a run of the mill film\u000aglorified by movie luvvies.Even trailer park trash have got in on the\u000aact" my favorik filum iz da shawshank regemshun". -thats when i knew\u000athe farcical proportions of overrated glorification this film had\u000areached.Its supposed to be about "liberation,emancipation....blah blah\u000ayou know the usual poncey guff thats trotted out for meaningless\u000asymbolism and metaphor.Luvvies love a movie voice over commentary,aka\u000ascorcese - why ,who knows?.But the film does have a potent manipulative\u000apower - which was also used by another weakish film -the shining, and\u000athat is the pathos laden empowering music score- this is what so\u000abrilliantly fools gullible viewers sadly.In the final analysis how can\u000aa film be great when it contains a ridiculous scene of a\u000aprisoner(robbins) immobilising a whole prison full of violent\u000aincarcerated males by playing opera- and yet he doesn't even receive a\u000arightly deserved mother of all beatings\u000a

V\u000aHope is a good thingThe movie named the shawshank redemption told us a story about a banker\u000acalled Andy Dufresne who is convicted and jailed for the murder of his\u000awife. His life is changed.The life in the shawshank redemption is a life-long nightmare. Severe\u000aand unbearable rule and punishment, what¡¯s more, the same routine\u000alife; boring and dull make them isolated from the outside world. The\u000ahigh wall can isolate the freedom of the physical body, but it can't\u000aisolate the freedom of the mind. Andy Dufresne have strong will in his\u000amind that hope is a good thing .his inmate friend red told him good is\u000adangerous thing ,especially inthe jail. There can be miracles when you believe though hope is frail.\u000aIt¡¯s hard to kill. Who knows what miracle you can achieve! Andy found\u000amany meaningful and beneficial things to do .during the imprisoned life\u000atime he is digging a channel led to the outside bit by bit. A continues\u000adripping water can wear through a stone. we all know that life is too\u000ashort for waiting, but I also know that life is long enough for doing\u000asomething that really turns me on and energize me .......hope is a good\u000athing always it is .after watched the movie, I thought a lot about my\u000alife . Do I still have hope in my future life? I always complained\u000aabout my present life .always resented my boring life .never think\u000aabout how to change it. I am awake now .clearly awake! I don¡¯t want to\u000abecome the frog which is boiled by the warm water step by step! If you have hope you can overcome anything no matter what our\u000asituation.

V\u000aSomething more beautiful -----The Shawshank RedemptionThis movie tells us a tale that takes place during the 1940's in a\u000ahorror prison called Shawshank. The story is about a young banker named\u000aAndy Dufresne; a man was wrongly accused of murdering his wife though\u000ahe was innocent. After Andy Dufresne was sentenced to Shawshank Prison,\u000ahe must deal with those people despise and bully him, those brutal\u000aguards without any justice, and a corrupt warden who cannot do\u000aanything. Then he discovers the horror of prison. Prisoners in this\u000aprison seem to have been forgotten the hope and freedom which belonged\u000ato them. They forget how to live a free life and cannot think of some\u000abeautiful things outside the prison. Gradually, they get use to the\u000aprison life and give up the seeking of freedom. They become unconcerned\u000aand lose their faith, which is the most awful thing to one¡¯s life. In\u000athis prison he meets a man who has been sentenced to there for some\u000atime already, Red, who then strikes up the friendship with him. He is\u000athe narrator and is known as the guy who is able to get almost any type\u000astuff from the prison. He helps Andy finding a rock hammer which helps\u000aAndy escape from the prison at last. What make me admire Andy most is\u000ahis unremitting perseverance. He spends almost 20 years to dig a\u000achannel and escape outside from the prison just by a small rock hammer!\u000aOne should not lose or give up his faith and dream, or just like a man\u000awithout his soul. He cannot do nothing only knows he is surviving in\u000athe world like an animal. Courage is the motivations which stimulate\u000ayou go ahead the success field in the dream. Andy writes a letter to\u000aRed after he gets outside. In the letter, such sentences like this:Remember, Red. Hope is a good thing, maybe the best of things,and no good thing ever dies. I will be hoping that this letter findsyou, and finds you well. Your friend. Andy. I like the letter very\u000amuch. It touches my heart deeply and makes me think much. I think about\u000athe life in the future, think about the meaning of my life. How should\u000aI do and which road I choose will make the life more meaningful? It is\u000adecided by yourself!Guangxi University of Technology Foreign Language Department English Major Class022Yuanqiong Chen (Joan)\u000a

V\u000aWhy does SHAWSHANK look like a cheap TV Production? - Average Camera work. It does the job, but nothing more. The director\u000ais a first timer... this shows! - Many scenes last too long. Lack of\u000abudget? - Nothing really exiting happens. It's just a nice story with\u000amany happy happy endings (thanks to Stepen King). Too manipulative!Don't get me wrong: SHAWSHANK is not a boring or bad movie ... it is\u000ajust an average feel good happy message movie. I would rate it a 6.5\u000aout of 10.OK folks, watch this if you like manipulative feel good movies. Is\u000athere more to say?\u000a

V\u000a\u000aI struggle to find how people hate this film, it's their opinion and\u000athat's fair enough but I can't help but think they hate this film\u000abecause of it's great reputation!It probably is the greatest movie of all time. From the screenplay to\u000athe direction to the cast right to the Special Edition DVD cover art\u000athis film is genius!So sad that it was overshadowed by two other films that year! I believe\u000ait must have been Forrest Gump at the Oscars and Pulp Fiction to the\u000acool dudes! I think if someone can boast seeing Shawshank at the cinema\u000adeserves a medal!!!Frank Darabont, Tim Robbins & Morgan Freeman deserve all the praise\u000athey've received since and they've gone on to great careers.I don't need to go on about the story etc because the majority know how\u000agood the film is.If you haven't watched it where have you been?\u000a\u000a

V\u000a\u000aIn our culture today, action films have become the (unfortunate)\u000astandard. The Shawshank Redemption defies that standard to the last\u000amoment. Not an action scene to be seen, yet it still holds just about\u000aany audience captive (excuse the pun). With a great deal of (at times, preachy but) never dull dialogue,\u000aexcellent characters, remarkable situations and one of the finest, most\u000adramatic scores ever written, this film manages to inspire and uplift\u000ajust about any viewer.Personally, next to the "The Godfather", this is the perfect film. Some\u000acould even justify it as the most perfect film of all time, and I would\u000abe unable to argue that even, for I fail to see it becoming dated or\u000airrelevant. And on a closing note, Frank Darabont is the genius behind this\u000ascreenplay (which was, of course based on a Stephen King short). But\u000aMr. Darabont is also one of the writers behind the far inferior sequel\u000ato "The Fly", known as "The Fly II" and "Nightmare On Elm Street III".\u000aSo, I guess if he can bring to life this film, anyone who believes in\u000atheir project enough could also have a shot.\u000a\u000a

V\u000aI know that other people's votes shouldn't influence mine, either\u000away--but geez, No.2 of all time? What are the IMDb demographics that\u000acreate that overblown result?I thought this was a very entertaining movie, somewhere around 8\u000apoints. But the script is kind of sugary and the characters lack the\u000asubtlety you would expect in a truly great drama. The ending reminded\u000ame of The Great Escape.There are several good performances that aren't quite able to shake\u000aloose the limitations of the script and become stirring.Cute, but not the greatest prison drama ever. I think there must be a\u000alot of teenagers voting on IMDb.\u000a

V\u000aOn the outside, Frank Darabont's directorial piece de resistance does\u000anot look promising: Scripts purloined from little-known Stephen King\u000anovellas, hacked up and padded with sentimental Hollywood schmaltz do\u000anot tend to yield cinematic gold. King, a master of unnerving,\u000apsychological drama would never be so trite as to tag one of his\u000astories with a vague, syrupy axiom like 'Fear can hold you prisoner.\u000aHope can set you free.'  that kind of corny meddling smacks of the ad\u000amen tugging mercilessly at the heart strings, ripping the freshness and\u000aoriginality out of every project they come across. I am also\u000aimmediately wary of prison melodramas (especially those with the word\u000a'redemption' in the title)  they are all so predictable.These were my thoughts as I first contemplated watching The Shawshank\u000aRedemption almost a decade ago. Then there was nothing like the hype\u000aand fervour that surround the movie now. I had only the rapturous,\u000abreathless testimony of a friend of mine to go on, and he was something\u000aof a philistine when it came to the pictures (I believe his previous\u000afavourite film was Robin Hood Prince of Thieves, so you can forgive my\u000ascepticism).Still I did some research before going in: Yup, thought so: Idealistic\u000ayoung man, banged up for a crime he didn't commit  I'll bet he soon\u000abears the brunt of some pent-up sexual aggression from his misanthropic\u000afellow inmates. What's that? He befriends an institutionalised black\u000aguy played by Morgan Freeman? I would imagine he'll be providing a wise\u000avoice-over throughout, perhaps whimsically tinged with an ingenuous\u000aSouthern drawl. And the Warden: He'll be a stern, God-fearing fellow\u000awith steel-rimmed spectacles and a shady secret.I went along and watched it anyway of course (my social diary as a\u000ateenager was hardly cram-full) and as I sat, I soon realized I was\u000aright on all counts. But still I watched. Past the grim depictions of\u000anew recruits being raped and beaten by both guard and lag; past the\u000ascene on the roof with the insurance advice and the ice-cold beers;\u000apast the bittersweet tale of Brooksy's freedom and Tommy Williams'\u000afateful revelations. I watched through the ever-changing posters on\u000aAndy Dufresne's wall, and at the end I, like everybody else in the\u000acinema emerged blinking, dry-of-mouth and my heart soaring.Teenagers aren't supposed to be awash with optimism and joy. They\u000aslouch and scowl and lock themselves in their rooms with the stereo on\u000afull blast, but, despite myself, I couldn't take the big soppy grin off\u000amy face or shake the shiver from my spine. After watching The Shawshank\u000aRedemption, I smiled so hard my cheeks ached.Because what cynical young sods like me didn't realize was that some\u000afilms are formulaic for a reason. You cannot reinvent the wheel every\u000atime. What I also learnt was that redemption (when it is done right)\u000acan be the most moving and satisfying cinematic theme of them all.\u000aShawshank excels in its simplicity. It is by no means the only great\u000aprison drama: Cool Hand Luke oozes, well cool, but the young Paul\u000aNewman was such a screen god that the film ends up being more of a\u000aslavish homage. Other prison revenge flicks (Murder in the First and\u000aSleepers spring to mind) are more obsessed with action or courtroom\u000afinger pointing than any thoughtful resolution and the protagonists are\u000abitter and angry. Not here. The characterisation is crisp yet understated. Tim Robbins'\u000aDufresne draws empathy and respect in equal measure, while Freeman's\u000aRed has an extraordinary dignity. When we meet him, he has served 20\u000ayears for a murder he committed as a kid and any angst and aggression\u000ahas gradually ebbed away. Now he is revered as 'a man who can get\u000athings.' Inside his ability to procure contraband has made him\u000ainfluential  much more so than he ever was as a free man  but instead\u000aof using it to bully and menace his fellow cons, he sits back in quiet\u000areflection. This is Red's redemption.Dufresne meanwhile has a grander plan and it comes to fruition in the\u000amost splendid fashion. Unusually, we see it all through Red's eyes and\u000athat leaves us as wide-eyed and incredulous as the warden after he\u000athrows the pebble through Raquel Welsh's midriff. I am not usually in favour of the retrospective voice-over. It is a\u000alazy, mawkish device that is all to often used to paper over plot holes\u000aor lack of imagination. This one is different. I suppose it is all in\u000athe voice and Freeman sounds like he has been gargling with a heady\u000amixture of rich New England soil and spitting whiskey. It is quiet but\u000awholly convincing  much more so than his subsequent authoritative\u000aPresidential ramblings in Deep Impact. The language he uses is easy and\u000auncomplicated but breathtakingly effective:'His first night in the joint, Andy Dufresne cost me two packs of\u000acigarettes. He never made a sound,' he says when the new convict\u000arefuses to buckle, wryly encapsulating the intricacies of a friendship\u000abased on a mutual respect and true affection.Who will ever forget Red as an old man 'so excited I can hardly sit\u000astill or hold a thought in my head' as he shuffles along the stone wall\u000ain the cornfield towards the big oak tree and Andy's hidden treasure \u000aa true moment of silver screen magic. 'Get busy livin', or get busy\u000adyin',' is the final maxim, and by that stage, no matter how cold or\u000ahard-nosed you purport to be, I defy you not to have a lump in your\u000athroat. Maybe for once the ad men got it right.10/10\u000a

V\u000a\u000aSo everybody in the world thinks I am insane for having never seen "The\u000aShawshank Redemption", so I finally broke down and rented it the other day.\u000aWhat I thought was going to be a really good film turns out to be nothing\u000abut a bunch of hoop-la sandwiched in-between opening and closing credits\u000aamounting to nothing. What a snooze fest this turned out to be. I was bored\u000aalmost 90% of the movie and have decided to make a list of things I would\u000ahave rather spent the two hours of my life doing instead of torturing myself\u000awith what I consider to be one of the worst 5 movies ever made (don't get me\u000astarted on Pulp Fiction).1. Wash dishes2. Let a burning candle drip wax on my arm3. Drive 60 miles and turn around and drive back without\u000astopping4. Practice getting my tetris score just a bit higher5. Count silently in my head to 10,0006. Beat King's Quest I againThere are countless other things I would rather do that watch this horrible\u000amovie again, but I think you get the point. Do not believe the hype\u000asurrounding this movie because you will just end up hurt and bitter like I\u000adid. \u000a

V\u000a\u000aIf you haven`t seen this film, watch it as soon as you can. Maybe you`ve had\u000athe chance to do it, but just skipped it because you thought it was one more\u000astory in prison. Yes and no! YES because most part of "Shawshank Redemption"\u000ahappens in a prison, but NO, it's not like the others. It's much better.The story, you may know more of it in the Plot Outline, is really\u000ainteresting and the performances are just impossible to forget. There is a\u000alittle of everything: drama, friendship, violence, love and dream..."Dream\u000aof Freedom". That's the title in Portuguese.My Rate 9/10\u000a   \u000a

V\u000a\u000ayes this movie is one of the greatestThis movie changed my thinking about people who go to prison. I believe\u000athat everyone deserves a second chance no matter what it is. They need\u000ato be given a chance to change themselves. Morgan Freeman did justice\u000ato his role i was really touched at the end part when he's there for\u000athe parole and the words that came out of his mouth. Tim Robbins was\u000atremendous, its the first time i noticed him as an actor and he's one\u000aof the best.prison is terrible place to be its like a whole new world and my\u000aperspective has changed about that. I rate this movie 10/10 its the\u000abest, the story is great and the director does a great job. well done\u000a\u000a

V\u000a\u000aSome truths not much but a few are accepted by nearly every people. You\u000amay not love Lord of the Rings, Star Wars,Braveheart, Love stories,\u000aGrease or any big movie but YOU LOVE THIS. LOOK in IMDb it is in the\u000asecond place but look how many people voted, more than 120000 voted so\u000athis is the secret first movie. It stimulates your neurons, something\u000achanges inside you. White, black, yellow, American, European, African\u000aall people meet in some ways. THE BIGGEST EXAMPLE IS SHAWSHANK\u000aREDEMPTION, everyone likes it -few exceptions. I sometimes think that\u000awe are all humans that are created in a way that we love this movie (or\u000aDarabont-director is not human so he made the movie for us to love\u000ait)Go talk to others ask about films then ASK ABOUT SHAWSHANK and see\u000athe change on their features then catch the smile of people when you\u000atalk about SHAWSHANK.Some truths not much but a few are accepted by\u000anearly every people (beginning as finish) (finish as beginning)\u000a\u000a

V\u000a\u000aThis Is My Absolute Favorite Movie Of All Time. When This Movie First\u000aCame Out In Theaters, I was still in Middle School And Thought That It\u000aLooked Pretty Stupid, Boy was I WRONG! Some Of the Best Performances\u000aI've Ever Seen Given In A Movie, Heart Wrenching Emotion, And Most Of\u000aAll Hope. No Matter What Never Give Up Hope. This Movie Changed My\u000aLife. Before I Saw This Movie I Was A Troublemaker Who Did Poorly In\u000aSchool. After I saw This Movie I Tried Harder To Be A Better Person, A\u000aPerson Who Always Did My Best. I Believe This Movie Has Helped Me Get\u000aTo Where I Am, A Happy, Hard Working, Hopeful Person, & That Is Perhaps\u000aThe Best Of Things. I Would Appreciate Any Feed Back From People Who\u000aAppreciate This Film As Much As I Do.\u000a\u000a

V\u000a\u000aI am dumbfounded by the exorbitant praise for this movie. It is almost\u000afrightening--like a cult.  I watched it last night and was completely\u000aunderwhelmed.  This did not have have half the emotional charge of a dozen\u000aother prison flicks, not to mention other dramatic categories.  Yes, the\u000astory was OK, good (not great) acting, but I found it to be largely insipid\u000aand predictable.  It just did not grab me like other stories of redemption\u000asuch as A Christmas Carol or It's a Wonderful Life.  As you can see by my\u000aciting these two films, I am not offended by cheesy sentimentality, if well\u000adone.  Shawshank simply had nothing new to say or a new way to say it.  The\u000aonly reason I am writing this review is to demonstrate that there are indeed\u000asome people who are not swept away by this movie.  Otherwise, I would not\u000ahave bothered.  The film simply was not interesting enough.\u000a

V\u000a\u000aThe Shawshank Redemption is the 1994 movie about the banker named Andy\u000aDufresne (Tim Robbins). Andy finds himself being accused of the murder\u000aof his cheating wife and her lover. After being convicted of both\u000amurders, Andy is sentenced to two life sentences at the dark Shawshank\u000aPenitentiary. He is mostly a quiet man and only talks to a few men in\u000aprison. Early on, Andy meets Ellis 'Red' Redding (Morgan Freeman). Red\u000ais the man in prison who can get things from the outside and knows how\u000athe prison runs. He may be a step above the inmates and a step below\u000athe guards, but deals with both to keep everyone satisfied. Throughout\u000aAndy's years in prison, he has many projects that he works on, starting\u000aon maybe the hardest--surviving. From the very beginning of his\u000aincarceration, Andy has to fight off the prison gang 'The Sisters' who\u000atry to isolate Andy so the can sexually have their way with him. After\u000athe leader is finally taken care of by the guards, Andy is left alone\u000ato work on other ventures. Andy decides to take up an old hobby and\u000astart carving rocks in chess pieces by using the rock hammer he\u000areceived from Red. He is later given an office job of assistant\u000alibrarian after doing taxes for the warden and all the prison guards.\u000aDuring these years, Andy writes to state legislators to get the prison\u000amoney for a better library and helps many inmates receive a high school\u000aeducation. Andy soon finds out that the warden is corrupt and helps him\u000alaunder money, but makes sure the warden doesn't find out about his\u000aplans that he is willing to carry out at the end of the movie. This is\u000avery dark movie and shows both the good and bad sides of living out a\u000alife sentence. The movie has a message about how some men become part\u000aof the prison and cannot live without it. It shows that people can get\u000amentally attached to the worst the world has to offer.\u000a\u000a

V\u000a\u000aI can understand why this film is loved so much, but I can equally\u000aunderstand, although I do not agree, why it is despised. People say it\u000ais life affirming, brings hope and happiness, and it does, others say\u000ait is sentimental crap, and at times it is. But I've always been a\u000asucker for sentimental movies, ones which have the power to genuinely\u000amove the viewer, and not hide under a cheap plot and a tragic death.\u000aBeing another King adaptation, there is violence, and hardness to\u000acounteract the sentimentality, and the prison, although not as\u000ahorrifying as those seen in Midnight Express and other movies, breaks\u000athe human soul to the point that it relies on the prison for survival.\u000aHeartbreaking, tear jerking, brutally funny, all phrases used\u000arepeatedly to describe this film, all appropriate. A film everyone\u000ashould love. Great Quotes: Andy. 'I have to remind myself that some\u000abirds aren't meant to be caged' 9 out of 10\u000a\u000a

V\u000a\u000aI was amazed, encaptured and enthralled when I saw this film for the first\u000atime. I was flicking idly through the television one night when I caught\u000athe\u000aopening titles just as I was about to go to bed, and thought I'd give it a\u000atry. What can I say? 3 hours later I was almost in tears over the ending,\u000abut I'll say no more.It's obvious the film has overwhelming themes of hope, friendship,\u000aredemption ad freedom, but it is the hope that so suffuses the film and\u000alifts it above other "triumphing over adversity" films. It is a film that\u000adoes not try to justify any governmental or judicial system, or the skill\u000aof\u000aa lawyer, but simply the hope and compassion that is part of the tarnished\u000ahuman spirit.I bought this film on DVD recently, replacing my rather elderly tape, and\u000ait\u000acost me the grand total of £3 (about $5 or so) and, pound for pound, it's\u000athe best value for money I've ever spent on anything. If only all DVD's\u000awere\u000athis good and this cheap.\u000a

V\u000a\u000aWell... this is the cat out of the bag. Pandora's box opening. Why did I\u000aever find a critique site. I'm one of the most opinionated stubborn\u000ash...uhh\u000aso and so's.... in the world.So I guess first and foremost did I like it. No!..........Just kidding.\u000aHow\u000acan you fail to? Its my favourite movie of all time. It has just occurred\u000ato\u000ame that this may be my first ever sober critique of the film. It's one of\u000athose movies confined to the small, smokey, pokey corners of a pub when\u000athe\u000aissue of greatest film of all time comes up. There's always a 'goodfellas'\u000aand a 'Godfather trilogy' and an 'Empire Strikes back' 'Labyrinyth' (?)\u000aVoice in the crowd ,(I mix in strange circles) But its fairly unanimous,\u000aeveryone likes this film. So why?Where do I start. Morgan Freeman...Goes without saying. Tim Robbins...Not\u000asure anyone else could play Dufresne now. Bob Gunton....Born to play evil.\u000aWilliam sadler...Under-rated.But it's not really the actors or the Director/photography etc. It's the\u000ascript. Beautifully constructed. It flows like liquid perfection. Morgan\u000aFreeman's VO helps no end. (Brad Pitt described it in 'Se7en' commentry as\u000athe voice of god).I had the fortune to watch this before the hype. I got it out on video the\u000aday it came out cause I was a fan of Morgan Freeman. I sat there in\u000asilence\u000afor fifteen minutes after the final credit had scrolled past my screen.\u000aIt's\u000athat good. Breathtaking. (spoiler) When Red wanders across that beach and\u000awe\u000asee Dufresne there, and the camera slowly pans upwards and away, you know\u000ayou've been part of something special. I'm not a fan of sickly sweet\u000a'hollywoodised' endings but every now and then they get it\u000aright.I should stop now cause I could go on for ever. (The 'record' scene,\u000aBrook's\u000aparole, the 'beers on the roof', the 'poster', the 'salvation comes from\u000awithin' rock hammer).I better stop there. Need to take a tablet. See thats why they shouldn't\u000amake movies this good.Yeah I quite liked it then.Don't mind and comments/critique/feedback. The e-mails\u000athere.\u000a

V\u000a\u000aThis film offers pretty visuals, good-acting and an interesting\u000ascreenplay.But it´s a movie very overrated among IMDB users, who put it at the 2th\u000aplace on best movies list.The explanation is simple the old "fight for your dreams", "never give up"\u000amotive, which thrills and delight audiences.SPOILERS AHEAD\u000aFor me, the movie doesn´t work in this way. At the end, the protagonist is\u000aold, he had been raped, bitten, etc. The final doesn´t work for me in a\u000afull\u000ahappy end, the main time of his life has already gone!\u000a

V\u000a\u000aThis film is based on one of my favourite Stephen King novels (albeit a\u000a'novella') The original book contained four long 'short stories' one which\u000abecame 'Stand By Me' (another great movie) and 'Rita Heyworth & The\u000aShawshank Redemption' which has been (full marks to the director& production\u000ateam)lovingly rendered into a true cinematic masterpiece. Staying true to\u000athe printed word, it follows the prison life of Andy Dupree from sentence to\u000afreedom with care and sympathy, never revelling in his hardships or flouting\u000ahis attempts at beating the system. The film concentrates on his will to\u000asurvive and his hope for eventual freedom. Tim Robbins & Morgan Freeman were\u000aborn to play their respective parts in this film. If neither had ever made\u000aanother film, it would not matter because this film will always be their\u000amark in movie history. No major action sequences, no breathtaking special\u000aeffects and no outrageous subject matter. Just a great movie, based on a\u000agreat story, acted convincingly with great skill by two men who could really\u000abe the best of friends the story requires them to be. Superb.\u000a

V\u000a\u000aI love this film so much,it is my all time favourite movie,and I really\u000adont\u000athink any film will have such a profound effect on me.It almost inspires\u000ayou\u000ato do almost anything,and the tagline alone has a mystic and philisophical\u000afeel about it(Fear can hold you prisoner,Hope can set you free!).The great\u000athing about this film is that it can represent anything that has happend\u000ain\u000ayour life,good or bad.I think that is what gives an edge to this film,of\u000awhich many films forget to include!It's quite funny to think that this\u000afilm\u000awas a huge flop at the box office,and that it wasnt untill the film came\u000aout\u000aon VHS that it really got the world wide recognition that it so truly\u000adeserved!Beautifully made,inspiring and an emotional ride of hope and\u000afreedom!I absolutely love it,best film ever!!!!!!!!Stu.\u000a\u000a

V\u000a\u000aThe Shawshank Redemption IMHO is truly the  greatest movies of all time.\u000aIt\u000ais my personal favourite and I can not comprehend how anyone would not\u000alike\u000athis film. After seeing it, for nearly a dozen or so times, I can still\u000asee\u000ait with the same fervor and excitement. Not one moment of this movies is\u000adull or uninteresting.\u000aThe cast is brilliant, especially Tim Robbins as the wrongly accused Andy\u000aDufresne and Morgan Freeman as Red. Also, the greedy  and treacherous\u000awarden\u000ais wonderfully portrayed by Bob Gunton. The film sends a message about\u000ahope\u000aand the human spirit.\u000aThe movie has several subplots, which each have their own pace. Andy\u000amaking\u000afriends with his inmates first and then the prison guards, his building of\u000athe library, him tutoring Tommy, working for conniving Warden Norton,\u000aescaping from prison and then Red getting out and going to find him, all\u000aof\u000awhich never create a boring moment.\u000aThe best part of the movie is after when Andy escapes, and the story of\u000aRed\u000auntill he meets Andy. I also liked the part when Brooks gets out and  cant\u000aseem to cope with the changed pace of life after being "institutionalised"\u000afor nearly 40 years.\u000aIt is hope which keeps this movie alive. The hope that someday Andy will\u000aget out, the hope that Red will see his friend once again really sends a\u000amessage of inspiration, to never lose hope. As Red truly says, "Get busy\u000alivin', or get busy dying "!\u000aThe score by Thomas Neuman is also brilliant.\u000aFor those people who have not yet seen this movie, you should definitley\u000awatch it whenever you get a chance. A true masterpiece. I cannot see how\u000athis movie did not get Best Picture. Forrest Gump can not even be compared\u000ato this film.\u000a

V\u000a\u000aThis is perhaps one of the best movies I have ever seen and no doubt the\u000abest of Stephen King. Director Frank Darabont created a masterpiece.It is a very intelligent story telling us how hard prison life can\u000abe.\u000aIt critics the judgements of innocent prisoners. But the most I liked is\u000athat every time there is another interesting story that develops in this\u000aprison. At the last third of the movie we can enjoy the big surprise or the\u000adessert. This novel is very nice told and it merits standing ovation. I and\u000amy wife rarely see such films. This is quality of film making and today\u000awhere we are?   8.5/10.If you liked this don´t miss another masterpiece from the same director\u000acalled "THE GREEN MILE". \u000a

V\u000a\u000a**SOME MINOR SPOILERS**I was like some other people in that I have had never seen "The Shawshank\u000aRedemption" until 2 nights ago.  Now, I just got done watching it for the\u000a2nd straight night in a row.  How anyone can say that this movie is\u000aoverrated is beyond me; it is almost like they want to say that to be\u000adifferent!The acting is outstanding by everyone involved including Robbins,\u000aFreeman,\u000aSadler, Gunton, Brown, etc.  Maybe the most chilling scene is when Tommy\u000areveals to Red and Andy about how he had a cellmate at another prison\u000areveal\u000ato him about that time "he killed that golf pro and that b*tch he was\u000aknocking up".  There was something about that scene in how Darabont\u000afilmed\u000ait with the lighting and the laugh of that guy.  It left an impression on\u000ame.  It also was the turning point of the movie, although you could tell\u000afrom the very beginning that Andy was not like any other\u000aconvict.One thing that sorta bothered me was near the end when it was revealed to\u000athe press about all the stuff going on at Shawshank, how it was so quick\u000afor\u000aNorton, Hadley, etc. to get theirs.  I mean how did Andy really\u000aaccomplish\u000athis without giving himself away and how did they not trace his\u000awhereabouts\u000aor question him?  Oh well, I guess wondering about one thing like that is\u000anot too bad.  Normally, there are like 5 things or more that I wonder\u000aabout\u000ain every movie, but that is why it is a movie, I guess.At any rate, don't let the above paragraph ruin it for you...I'm just a\u000aweirdo after all...:)  The music, camera angles, lighting, acting, etc.\u000aare\u000aall outstanding.This is a movie that needs to be watched over and over again and should\u000abe\u000atreasured.  There is a reason for it being ranked #2 all-time, people.\u000aIt's\u000athat good.  If you wind up enjoying this movie, I recommend another\u000aDarabond\u000amovie based on a Stephen King work in "The Green Mile".  It is a\u000alittle-bit\u000amore fantasy than Shawshank but it is an outstanding movie.\u000a

V\u000a\u000aReading through the comments by other contributors here, I begin to\u000arealise\u000athe reason why this movie features in so many all time top 10s - the film\u000ameans different things to different people.As straightforward prison drama it is head and shoulders above others of\u000aits\u000atype - an epic story told with sensitivity and emotion, superbly acted and\u000abrilliantly shot. What makes what would have been a good film into a great\u000aone is the subtexts and themes which run through it that allow the viewer\u000ato\u000aactually think.Personally, my more recent viewings of the movie have highlighted the\u000areligious subtext - the way that Red is influenced to 'get busy livin'\u000a(and\u000afind his way to the Promised Land) as a result of meeting Andy, the\u000aCrucifixion/Resurrection/Redemption metaphor of Andy's escape as he stands\u000awith his arms wide letting the rain wash away everyone else's\u000ash*t/sins.To be honest, I hate it when people try to look too deeply into art and\u000aidentify supposed meaning of which the artist probably had no intention at\u000aall. I might be way off with these religious musings but the fact that I\u000ahave been stirred to comment on them merely reinforces the power of this\u000amovie in the way that it can move us.\u000a

V\u000a\u000aAlthough a long film, and for the most part not light hearted, I am able\u000ato\u000awatch "The Shawshank Redemption" again and again and to this day I can't\u000afind fault with it. It was a brave film to make because if it hadn't been\u000amade and acted so well, some parts could have been very tacky. One thing I\u000alike about the film is the way in which it shows the convicts to be normal\u000apeople who have made mistakes, not monsters. It emphasised how everybody\u000adeserves rights, even if they are in prison. It is an emotional\u000arollercoaster for me making my heart break or swell with happiness. That\u000asounds tacky, but it's not if you've seen the film.\u000a

V\u000a\u000aMINOR SPOILERS AHEADThe Shawshank Redemption is a rare film that pulls off something no other\u000asappy movie is capable of: it manages to touch me effectively.  I was\u000aabsolutely enthralled by the story of Andy (Tim Robbins) who is wrongly\u000aconvicted for a double murder and spends twenty years in prison, making\u000afriends with "Red" (Morgan Freeman) "the guy who can get things".  The\u000atrials of his life in prison were effective and entertaining without\u000aresorting to the unrelenting sap of modern sap loaded atrocities like Mel\u000aGibson's unbearable The Patriot.  The story is full of wonderful acting,\u000abeautiful direction and a great story. A must see!   \u000a

V\u000a\u000aThat such an excellent film could possibly derive from a short story by Rita\u000aHayworth before she was a mean gleam in anyone's eyes, rewritten here for\u000athe screen by Stephen King, is in itself a surprise. Tim Robbins and Morgan\u000aFreeman turn in excellent performances, ably helped by a supporting cast of\u000afellow inmates and prison wardens which give the film a wholeness as against\u000aa film with two stars and some other actors. I'm not one for physical\u000aviolence, but in this film the violence is limited and justified by the\u000astory line, as this is inevitable in prisons at any moment. But the film is\u000amuch more  friendship and love, with its humourous moments.Photographed almost in a 50s style but with an obviously 90s mentality,\u000aRoger Deakins not only fills the screen visually but also emotionally, an\u000aextraordinary feat indeed. Thomas Newman caught that emotion well and his\u000aaccompanying music is very correct.\u000aMorgan Freeman pleases me more and more each time I see him, though I still\u000afeel that it is in `Driving Miss Daisy' where he gives his best performance.\u000aHe has wisely kept out of Sidney Poitier stereotyping, though it must be\u000asaid that times have changed and Poitier had to reflect social conditions of\u000ahis time and thus opened the way for excellent actors like Freeman and\u000aDenzel Washington.\u000aFrank Darabont has created a wonderful film  but number two best of all\u000atime in the IMDb scale? Well, I can give it a high 8 out of ten, about the\u000asame as the other Darabont/Stephen King film `The Green Mile', another\u000aprison film, hard, harsh. You might like to try Susan Sarandon and Sean\u000aPenn in Tim Robbins' film `Dead Man Walking' (also filmed by Roger Deakins)\u000awhich has a similarly powerful message, but without so much\u000aviolence.\u000a\u000a

V\u000a\u000aThis was one of the best films of the 1990's and was all but snubbed by the\u000aAcademy.  It was nominated for seven Oscars in 1995 including best picture,\u000abut it came up empty, trodden under by the Gump stampede.Frank Darabont's adaptation of Stephen King's short story was a thing of\u000abeauty.  The story of an accountant who thinks his way out of a\u000amaximum-security prison, and survives on sheer intelligence, guile and will\u000ais expertly spun and engrossing.  The ending is uplifting and\u000aexhilarating.Both Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman gave career performances.  Robbins was\u000aoutstanding in the portrayal of a character whose phlegmatic and understated\u000apersona belied his cunning and razor sharp intellect.  Freeman was also\u000afantastic as the old convict who knew how to get things done in the joint. \u000aFreeman's performance got him a Best Actor nomination in a year when Tom\u000aHanks was a cinch.  Everything about this film was superlative.  The direction, the\u000acinematography, the sound and the music were all top flight.  It is\u000adifficult to comprehend how such an accomplished film was left with so\u000alittle acclaim.I rated this film a 10/10.  I highly recommend it, although viewers should\u000abe advised that there is some disturbing prison violence.  Don't miss\u000ait.\u000a

V\u000a\u000aI can't help but feel emotional every time I see this film. Both Robbins and\u000aFreeman are excellent, and the supporting cast is good enough not to screw\u000aanything up, but they aren't spectacular. One of the few complaints I have about the film is that it does get slow at\u000atimes, and I find myself becoming a little bored. Another complaint I have\u000ais I wish the makers of Shawshank would give credit where credit is due for\u000athe amazing amount of scenes and ideas taken from Escape From Alcatraz,\u000astarring Clint Eastwood. How can so many critics claim that Instinct is\u000aderivative while none of them mention the fact that Shawshank Redemption is\u000aone of the most derivative movies of all time? Shawshank is significantly\u000abetter than Alcatraz, and it does have important emotional elements that\u000aAlcatraz is void of; but a theft is a theft, and that won't change unless\u000athe makers of Shawshank start giving credit to Alcatraz. Here are some of\u000athe things stolen: The digging tool being kept in a carved out bible and the somewhat funny\u000airony that that entails. The rapist encountering the star in the showers near the beginning of the\u000afilm to set up further encounters. An inmate at mealtime asking the star whether he will be eating something\u000aand then pulling out a small animal. I'm sure most Shawshank lovers thought\u000athat the whole bird thing was a completely original symbolic idea. Sorry,\u000abut even though the symbolism is well taken, it was FAR from original. The\u000awhole idea probably started with the mealtime animal scene, as it was\u000aobviously a direct steal. The digging debris being emptied out of the star's pants during strolls.The star befriending the black guy who can get you anything. True, Red is a\u000amuch more important character in Shawshank, but considering how much was\u000astolen, this certainly was too. There are several others that I have forgotten, as I have not seen Escape\u000afrom Alcatraz in quite awhile. And if Instinct had any cliché's, Shawshank\u000acertainly did, with the evil warden, the evil guard, the religion, the\u000a"highly intelligent" star, and the concentration on the "hole", where the\u000astar is always sent to burn for a while. Despite all of this, I really do like Shawshank Redemption and will probably\u000awatch it many times in the future, but it absolutely amazes me that I have\u000anot seen or heard one single critic mention the robbery here. And as people\u000abecame critic-following sheep with Instinct, they certainly did with\u000aShawshank. Jeremy Barger \u000ahttp://clubs.yahoo.com/clubs/firegodsmovieclub \u000a\u000a

V\u000a\u000aThe little-known novella Rita Hayworth and Shawshank Redemption has always\u000abeen one of my favourite King stories.  It's a prison drama with a\u000adifference, a tale with a twist which would make Jeffrey Archer turn green\u000awith envy, an exercise in character building which is difficult to fault.\u000aIn other words, a King tale just ripe for some hack to stuff up\u000aroyally.But Darabont doesn't.  What we have here is a rare work, a film which, on\u000apaper, doesn't have a great deal going for it, but which transcends the\u000aprison movie genre by basing its main thrust on people, as opposed to the\u000astandard violence and inhumanity tack adopted by most films based inside\u000afour high walls (use Lock Up or Fortress as relevant case studies).  It's\u000aa\u000abuddy-movie which has more in common with One Flew Over The Cuckoo's Nest\u000athan 48 Hours, and if you think that's too lofty a comparison then I\u000areally\u000acan't bring myself to care, such is my awe at the work I beheld on a\u000aTuesday\u000aevening some four weeks ago.I am at a loss to describe what has been created here.  The cast is\u000auniformly excellent - Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman could pretty much\u000acarry\u000athe show themselves, such is their screen presence, but there's not a weak\u000alink anywhere down the line.  The storyline is perfectly structured,\u000aproviding a sense of the passage of time without causing us to feel that\u000atoo\u000amuch has been left out.  The moments of violence are exactly as they\u000ashould\u000abe - short, sharp and brutal, not lovingly choreographed as is so often\u000athe\u000acase in this genre.  These scenes are genuinely oppressive, but the film\u000awisely intersperses them with moments of levity to prevent the viewer from\u000abeing overwhelmed by the injustice of it all.But what impresses me the most is the way in which King's novella has been\u000aexpanded by Darabont (who wrote the screenplay) in such a way that you\u000acould\u000abe forgiven for thinking he wrote the entire storyline exactly as it\u000aappears\u000aon the screen.  This is not so - many extra scenes have been added, but\u000athey\u000afit seamlessly into the whole, taking a great tale and making it even\u000abetter.  I would not have believed this to be possible, but such is the\u000atalent on display here that I am forced to admit that maybe, just maybe, a\u000ascreenwriter can take liberties with a source work and, in so doing,\u000aimprove its translation into the visual medium.This is the best movie I have seen in 1995, and at the end of the year\u000ait's\u000aodds-on that it will *still* be the best movie I saw in 1995.  I think\u000aeveryone involved with this project can take a bow, and when the Academy\u000aAwards time rolls around again I predict we'll be hearing a few acceptance\u000aspeeches  from the Shawshank team.If there's any justice in the world, that is.P.S.  I wrote the above in 1995.  Take a look at the awards results for\u000a1995\u000aand you'll see just how much justice in the world there\u000a*ain't*.\u000a

V\u000a\u000aI've read the novella from "Different Seasons," and feel that Frank\u000aDarabont's screenplay was an excellent refinement of King's story.  It\u000apretty much sticks with the original plot while eliminating some portions\u000awhich didn't add much to the story as a whole.  The only part I wish they\u000awould have included (that they didn't) was Red's tales of other breaks at\u000aShawshank Prison, if only for the novelty of them.\u000aRegarding the movie alone, I thought the grand aerial views of the prison\u000acombined with Thomas Newman's score (especially the 'Stoic Theme') were\u000aquite wonderful, almost breathtaking in their scope and power.  I would\u000ahave\u000ato say this is by far Tim Robbins' best role to date while it at least is\u000aamong Morgan Freeman's top three cinematic performances.\u000aI have seen this movie several times, and although I'd say the first\u000aviewing\u000ais the best, I never tire of experiencing the story of Andy and Red, their\u000astory of hope. \u000a

V\u000a\u000aThe Shawshank Redemption is a beautiful film about the power of\u000ahope. Andy Dufrense (Tim Robbins) is one of those rare \u000acharacters in American cinema that inspires one to live with\u000aconviction, tenacity, and poetry. The relationship between he\u000aand Red (Morgan Freeman) echoes the deep friendship found in the\u000aBiblical story of Jonathan and David. Truly a film to watch\u000aagain and again. "Get busy living, or get busy dying."          \u000a\u000a

V\u000a\u000aWhy do I think this movie so good? Because I find myself thinking about it\u000ayear after year, and I get more out of it each of the three times I've\u000aseen\u000ait. It works on several different levels.  First, the surface level, the\u000aplot and it's surprising twists the first time I saw it. On a second\u000alevel,\u000aare the themes of hope for Red and Andy, of how Red finally finds hope, of\u000ahow Andy secretly creates his own hope and escapes.On a deeper level, the movie is an allegoric tale for all human lives.  We\u000aare all imprisoned for crimes we didn't commit, namely the prison of life\u000awith it's ultimate death sentence for all of us. We all would love to be\u000aredeemed from death, whether we are religious or spiritual, or not.\u000a>\u000aI can think of no other movie that satisfies on these different levels. I\u000asee other comments here at IMDb about how other movies have better\u000acinematography, better directing, better acting, or comparing it to Cool\u000aHand Luke or other prison movies. Those comments miss the mark completely\u000abecause they are about the task of film making or superficial comparisons\u000aof\u000aplot devices.To me, great movies, like great literature, touch people's lives, change\u000aour\u000aview of the world, make us think about our place in the world. Does the\u000aGodfather hit that mark? Star Wars? Cuckoo's Nest? No Way! Even\u000aSchindler's\u000aList or Saving Private Ryan, as wonderful as those movies are, don't hit\u000athe\u000alevel of universal truth that Shawshank does, and does again, and again\u000aand\u000aagain.\u000a\u000a

V\u000a\u000aWhat is so great about this movie? The question should be: "What is not so\u000agreat about it?" And the answer would be: "Nothing!"The story is good, and the outcome is not obvious but great. The acting is\u000asuperb all over the line. Tim Robbins is Andy Dufresne and we suffer and\u000afeel joy with him.\u000aMorgan Freeman is magnificent as Red, and when he is narrating it is like\u000achocolate to the ears. He has so\u000amany great lines, most of which are quoted here, because they are worth\u000aremembering, like this: "Prison\u000alife consists of routine, and then more routine."\u000aThe music by Thomas Newman is fantastic. It soars over the movie giving it\u000athe right mood, sad many times but it always fits in.\u000aI have just seen this movie for the fifth time, and it keeps getting\u000abetter.\u000aI'm looking forward to seeing it again, when some time has passed. I know\u000athere will be something new to notice which is another reason why it is so\u000agreat.\u000aI haven't talked to anyone that didn't like it,\u000aand with the number one spot on IMDb's top 250 most people\u000amust like/love this masterpiece. I haven't found any flaws in the history,\u000athough you can find some errors on the\u000agoof list. That Forest Gump ran off with the Oscar\u000athat year seems unfair to me and obviously to a lot of other people\u000atoo.Why only the second best movie? My absolute favorite is and will always be\u000a"The Good, the Bad and the Ugly."\u000aI like This movie for some completely different reasons, like that I'm a\u000ahuge fan of Clint Eastwood, Sergio Leone and spaghetti western. But with\u000a"The Shawshank Redemption" almost everyone I know agrees with me.I hope there will come more movies like this, I hope many more people will\u000asee and enjoy this movie, I hope....\u000a

V\u000a\u000aIt makes me wonder how people can bash this movie and then rate such\u000amediocre films above it.\u000aOne thing we have to remember - yes, it's rated #1.  Why? Because it is rare\u000ato find a person out there who hated it. Thus, it makes sense that it is\u000aranked #1 - it has the highest AVERAGE RATING of all films voted upon here.I loved the movie.  And I didn't think that it was that hard to believe that\u000athere are men in prison who regret their crimes - much less that there were\u000amen in prison in the 60s that regretted their crimes.Incredible that people use this space to rip on the movie because of it's\u000anumber one status instead of giving it an honest review.\u000aLove it or like it, Shawshank is a good movie.  \u000a

V\u000a\u000aShawshank may not be the best film of all time, but for me it was perfect. A\u000afilm is perfect (for me) if it shows a character who wins against\u000ainsurmountable odds (Robbins). Another essential ingredient for a perfect\u000afilm is a character who, by his actions, changes the life of another human\u000abeing for the better (again, Robbins). The last 15 minutes of the film are\u000aso gripping: we don't know what is going to happen to Freeman, but we are so\u000ainvolved at this point that any other ending would be unthinkable.

V\u000a\u000aThe Shawshank Redemption is a wonderful film. It is one of the best films of\u000a1994. It is one of the better films of the 90's. It most certainly is not\u000aone of the best films of all time, and in turn, obviously not the best of\u000aall time. I respect those of you who have put it at number one. At least\u000ait's better than calling Happy Gilmore number one, but I\u000adigress.This is addressed to anyone who wonders how in all the world this film beat\u000aThe Godfather, Citizen Kane, 2001, and even Pulp Fiction for best film of\u000aall time. Each of these films is celebrated, henceforth it is also "chic" to\u000abad-mouth these movies. People hear that Citizen Kane is great so often that\u000awhen someone sees it and is disappointed, they take it personally. Same with\u000aPulp Fiction, so many loved it, that when somebody didn't like it all that\u000amuch, their dislike becomes hate, relative to the passion some people have\u000afor the film.Another prime example is Titanic. Where is it? It's not here on the Top 250.\u000aYet upon its release (and the subsequent months it was out) you almost\u000adidn't hear a single negative word about it. Not until the people who were\u000aso sick of the raves went, minds already made up to hate it. Some people are\u000aso pretentious that they despise anything mainstream. Hence, the backlash\u000aagainst Titanic.Now on to The Shawshank Redemption. The Shawshank Redemption is a film, like\u000aTitanic, that I have never heard one uncynical person say a bad thing about.\u000aObviously then, its ratings will be high (well-deserved). However, also\u000aworking in Shawshank's favor is the fact that it has never gone mainstream.\u000aThe fact that it tanked at the box office may have been the best thing that\u000ahappened to it. It never has become cool to knock Shawshank, therefore we\u000ararely have people rating it 1 out of spite. With this lack of poor reviews,\u000ait is no wonder Shawshank shot to the top. It is a marvelous little movie,\u000abut certainly no Citizen Kane or 2001.\u000a

V\u000a\u000aFor the longest time, since first seeing this movie in 1994, I never could\u000aplace my finger on WHY it has remained one of my all-time favorites.  At\u000afirst, and most obvious, was that it was a Stephen King screenplay, as I\u000alove how Mr. King writes, not from the horror aspect but from the suspense\u000aaspect.  This is a jail movie, and I have never really liked jail movies,\u000athey just never interested me.  However, this film was much more than a jail\u000amovie.  My growing interests in the visual and written arts, and continuing\u000astudy thereof has made me consciously aware of WHY this is one of my\u000aall-time favorites.The Shawshank Redemption, you can even speculate from its\u000atitle,"Redemption", that there is a struggle with humanity going on here.\u000aThis film is largely based on the human condition, and the struggle for this\u000aman, Andy, to not lose his humanity in his incarceration.Through a series of events, too much to elaborate on in this 1000 word limit\u000aby IMDB, Andy overcomes the emotional and physical barriers of his\u000aimprisonment to find his peace by means of a daring and well calculated in\u000ayears of preparation, plan which puts the warden and certain guards\u000ain the hands of real justice finally.  All these characters in this film,\u000aare so deep, that each one really deserves his own critical analysis.  This\u000ais a must see movie, and not one you can watch once.  You have to watch it\u000aseveral times to grasp what the writers have put forth.  It is truly one of\u000athose films that comes along out of nowhere, and has a great impact but is\u000anot recognized for what it really is.  As is all great art at the time, that\u000aillustrates the struggle of humanity and the human condition.  Kudos to\u000aStephen King for this gift.\u000a

V\u000a\u000aI'll save everyone from having to read the same list of superlatives that\u000aare in 99% of these comments, and just agree that it is literally the best\u000amovie ever made.My comments will be about my theory that Andy Dufresne was intentionally\u000adeveloped as a Christ figure in the movie.  I never actually read the short\u000astory, so I don't know if that was Stephen King's intention, but I do\u000abelieve that that is what the film-makers had in mind.  Andy Dufrense\u000a(initials A.D.) gave many speeches that sounded like sermons.  He spoke of\u000anever losing faith, no matter how bad it was in prison.  He wanted his\u000afriends to believe there was a better place waiting for them (Mexico).  He\u000aperformed miracles providing them with beverages on the rooftop.  By the end\u000athe warden saw Andy as a threat to his power if nothing else through sheer\u000acharisma.  Andy escaped the prison and contacted his friends still in prison\u000athrough a letter, giving them all hope.  When he escaped, he raised his arms\u000ainto a definite crucifix-like position (in the rain storm).Maybe I'm just stating the obvious (I mean "Redemption" is in the title!),\u000aor maybe I'm completely off base, but I am suprised I haven't seen this\u000amovie discussed in a more religious way (other than having such a religious\u000afollowing).  I'm not really a church-goer for my own reasons, but I found\u000awatching this movie to be a wholly spiritual experience.  I don't know what\u000amy favorite movie is, but whatever it is, it's no Shawshank... \u000a

This movie should have\u000aswept the Oscars for best picture, best acting (lead and supporting), best\u000adirecting, best screenplay....etc.I simply could not believe it when I saw that the AFI Top 100 did not\u000ainclude this picture at all.  It is simply the best film ever made.  Given\u000athe highly different tastes of individuals, it is rare that you can ask\u000afriends and acquaintances what the best movie that they have ever seen is and\u000aconsistently hear the response: "The Shawshank Redemption."

Most of them came back and told me how much they loved it\u000aand they couldn't believe they hadn't seen it sooner.  This is one of those\u000amovies that will be remembered forever by those who have seen it.  Those who\u000ahaven't are definitely missing out on a superb piece of work.  I enjoy it\u000amore every time I see it, and can't believe it didn't win the Oscar (it\u000adeserved many!) when it first came out.\u000a

V\u000aI enjoyed this the first time I saw it. But then again I was only an\u000aeasily impressionable 14-year-old, craving for new emotion. Recently,\u000amore than 10 years later, I revisited it, and barely managed to finish\u000ait. Bluntly, it's as plain and trite as it gets. In fact, I believe\u000aFrank deliberately wanted it that way, so that it would increase its\u000aappeal to the casual movie goers. In general, I have no problem with a\u000asimple, feel-good movie that does not take itself too seriously and is\u000anot looking to change its audience in a profound way. However, this\u000adoes and it seems it is succeeding unfortunately....We have a story about hope and its redemptive qualities, portrayed by\u000aan innocent man that is sent to prison(Tim's character). It's told\u000athrough the eyes of his closest prison friend(Morgan's character). The\u000anarrative framing and flow are rigid, there is no rhythm, no ebb and\u000aflow, no metaphors, no irony, just constant relentless narration -\u000aextreme simplicity. It's stripped to the point that you can only\u000aremember the generic message. Dangerous stuff. Some people carry it\u000aaround and "apply" it diligently. The others only observe the snowball\u000aeffect.I hope there are more intelligent endeavors out there. I hope everyone\u000asees them and appreciates them. I hope...1/5 - Skip this, if you are over 15. There is no art here - almost no\u000acontribution to the art of filmmaking and storytelling.\u000a

V\u000aThis film is very overrated by seemingly sensible people. It is a\u000aremarkably emotional film on a par with various pulpy Catherine Cookson\u000afilms. Talking of pulp, Pulp Fiction is awesome in comparison, as is\u000aThe Shining. That Shawshank is voted Number One on many movie charts,\u000ais absolute madness. I have seen it on various occasions and via\u000avarious media. And I cannot work out why people have it in such high\u000aregard. Over. Rated. Fact. Also, the film has no air of being cool or\u000astylish in any way - it has no wow-factor of great cinematography in\u000athe way a film like Let The Right One In has for example. It has no\u000ablack humour. It is tame by comparison to other films. It has no\u000aastounding scenes which Pulp Fiction has by the truckload. It has no\u000aatmosphere which a film like The Shining has by the snow-plough load.\u000aShawshank at Number One - Absolute Madness.\u000a

V\u000aThis film touches me. I believe it's the greatest film because I has an\u000aeffect on people's lives. We watch a lot of films everyday but hardly\u000awe refer back to them.This is a film I apply in everyday life. Hope is a good thing, maybe\u000athe best of things. The part I liked most is when Red said "some birds\u000aare not meant to be caged; they'll fly away and when they do, that part\u000aof you that knows it was a sin to have locked them up does rejoice..."Indeed we should build our lives such that circumstances cannot cage\u000aus.

V\u000aI saw this film back in '95 in Romania. Funny thing - it's translated\u000atitle there was "Angels' Prison"...I don't if it's the best ever made,\u000afor sure it's the one I liked the most. the film is about friendship -\u000aone thing who became pretty rare nowadays - and is simply magic, don't\u000ahave any other words to add except that I've logged in on IMDb' site\u000ajust to be able to vote and make sure it stays no. ONE. So it had 7\u000aOscar nominations, walked away with nothing. That tells me nothing\u000afolks, I only remember the emotions I experienced when I saw it. I'am\u000anot a touchy one but Shawshank did it for me, big time. And one final\u000aword, please don't forget Stephen King in all this, just because he had\u000acommercial success doesn't mean he's not great.\u000a

V\u000aThere are so many reviews here that it'd be amazing if anyone gets this\u000afar down the List, but it just proves how excellent this film is. Why\u000adidn't it win the Best Picture Oscar? Simple, because the Oscar voters,\u000alike most of us, hadn't seen it yet. Most people blame the title and\u000athe title does nothing to sell the film. It sounds like a religious\u000afilm as did "Deliverance". It was definitely not promoted well at all.\u000aI would bet the farm that most people on this list of reviews DID NOT\u000asee it in a theater. I didn't, but since my first viewing of it on DVD,\u000aI've seen it at least 6 times. I loaned my DVD out to friends,\u000arelatives and neighbors and not one of them said it was less than\u000aexcellent, and I'm talking some fussy movie watchers and folks who\u000ararely watch movies. Why? Because it's an engrossingly fabulous story,\u000atold extremely well by gifted filmmakers and crew. It has everything a\u000agreat movie has to have...stunning cinematography, crisp, swift-moving\u000adirection, an intelligent script, an emotionally moving score, a\u000atop-notch cast and more. If there's anyone who saw "it" coming, I'd say\u000ayou're fibbing, as it is anything but predictable. What more can one\u000asay! Excellent!\u000a

V\u000aWhat can I say about this movie; simply awesome, adorable, great,\u000abrilliant, excellent, the best ever movie I have seen in my entire\u000alife. Surely it is worth to be on the top for decades. When I got to\u000aknow about this movie I watched it and to my surprise it was zillions\u000atime better than I thought. Even the new sensation "The Dark\u000aKnight"(which is the best in its genre with the legendary acting by\u000alate Heath Ledger) could not match with this.I have watched movie so\u000amany times and even now not bored of it.The greatest performances from the actors Morgan Freeman (who is my\u000afavorite actor) and Tim Robbins is worth a watch.The story had every\u000athing about the prison life, the friendship bonding, about the\u000aHOPE(never to loose). The supporting cast was also very convincing and\u000arealistic.I will give it 10 if I can will give it more than that.I suggest you\u000aall to watch it and am sure u will love...........\u000ait.............................\u000a

I\u000ahave to admit, this is not one of the greatest, BUT THE GREATEST movie\u000aever produced.Brooks was there, so was Red... I wish I was also there to see it for\u000areal.This movie gave me new avenues, new thoughts, new energy and more than\u000aeverything... it gave me what it gave Morgan Freeman... HOPE\u000a

V\u000aI know tons of people have commented on this masterpiece already but I\u000afeel the need to make another one. First of all the plot, the\u000aconclusion, the acting, and the narration are classic. Morgan Freeman\u000acan make a movie just with his voice (but for the record this movie is\u000aso good it doesn't need it).There's no action or explosions just great actors committing to their\u000aroles and making it seem as if you know the characters personally. When I had just finished watching this the other night, I started\u000awatching Family Guy and a joke about Andy Dufresne and the sisters came\u000aon. Although I didn't find it to be very funny I thought to myself "Hey\u000aI know that movie!"When I finished watching it I thought about how it good it was and how\u000ait made me feel about myself for a good day and a half.If you like movies that are not just put out to entertain watch this\u000amovie, trust me you won't be disappointed.\u000a

Thomas Newman's music in the background makes the\u000amoments so sore and intense that you forget everything else. Some\u000acritics might say its a sentimental cry-baby movie, but forget about\u000ait.

V\u000a'The Shawshank Redemption' is that rare exception that transcends film\u000aitself to become a moving and harrowing experience. Based on a short\u000astory by Stephen King and brought to life for the big screen by Frank\u000aDarabont, one can only watch in awe as this story touches true\u000agreatness. Superb performances, commanding direction, smothering\u000aatmosphere, beautifully bleak cinematography. All the pieces come\u000atogether, and do they ever. This is worth more than just a second look,\u000athis a modern masterpiece.There's a great sense of inspiration that can be found at the center of\u000a'The Shawshank Redemption', and that's a story of hope. Hope through\u000aall that life throws at you, hope in midst of uttermost despair. We go\u000aon a journey with these characters, and their stories remain with us\u000along after we leave them. Andy's attempt to maintain hope and Red's\u000astruggle to allow the thought of it into his life is a powerful story\u000ato be told, highlighted by the fantastic performances from Tim Robbins\u000aand Morgan Freeman.What else is it but art? If a film can reach out beyond the annals of\u000acinema and become larger than itself, something more than a movie to be\u000aentertained by, can it be considered art? 'Shawshank' marked Frank\u000aDarabont's first venture into the work of Stephen King ('The Green\u000aMile' and 'The Mist' would follow), and it arguably remains his best\u000aand most accomplished effort to date. His ability to set the tone and\u000acreate its smothering prison atmosphere instantly grabs your attention\u000aand never relinquishes it.'The Shawshank Redemption' is a deeply moving picture that has to be\u000aexperienced, not observed. Felt, not merely seen. It tells an intricate\u000astory of extreme magnitude, leaving in its footsteps a poignant tale of\u000ahope and freedom. Allow yourself to be taken where films rarely go, the\u000atragic beauty of it all is nearly overwhelming. A sweeping work of art\u000ato remind us that above all else, when all seems to be lost, never give\u000aup hope. As Andy tells Red, hope is a good thing. And no good thing\u000aever dies.More reviews at\u000arottentomatoes.com/vine/journal_view.php?journalid=219276&view=public\u000a

V\u000aThe movie really seems to have moved me. Its a Story that arouses hope\u000awithin an individual. it reminds me of the famous lines from the a\u000agreat poem that "when winter comes spring cant be far behind".The movie revolves around the two character Andrew Dufresne and Red.\u000aAndy Dufresne, is sent to Shawshank Prison for the murder of his wife\u000aand secret lover. He is very isolated and lonely at first, but realizes\u000athere is something deep inside your body, that people can't touch and\u000aget to....'HOPE'. Andy becomes friends with prison 'fixer' Red (Morgan\u000aFreeman), and Andy epitomizes why it is crucial to have dreams. His\u000aspirit and determination, leads us into a world full of imagination,\u000afilled with courage and desire. This is about how he spreads his\u000amessage of hope through the Shashank Redemption!!!A must watch!! although it may don't seem so great at the beginning but\u000athe ending is marvelous which makes it a masterpiece!!! Do watch it....\u000a

V\u000aThere's just something about the way this movie is made that makes it a\u000aperfect film. Maybe its the dialouge, or the acting, or the music, or\u000athe cinematography. Whatever the case may be, the point is this, this\u000afilm is perfect! Whether your 15 or 80, this movie should deeply movie\u000ayou. I know that I was when I first saw it. I don't remember the exact\u000aage I was when I saw it, but I do remember how much this film made me\u000acare about the life I have today.This Film is a personal favorite of mine, not just because of what a\u000agreat film it is, but because it's a film my father and I have seen\u000aover 200 times together. The film really analyzes the bond between two\u000afriends and that's how I see my father and I.This film is absolutely brilliant. Morgan Freeman's best performance. I\u000athink the music and the cinematography go VERY unnoticed in the film, I\u000athought they were both brilliant. This film is perfect in every sense\u000aof the word and I believe should've won the Oscar for best picture over\u000a'Forrest Gump'(even though I truly loved this film).If you haven't already seen 'The Shawshank Redemption' please do\u000ayourself a favor, go to your local videostore, spend the seven dollars\u000aand watch it. Its worth every penny.This film is a true American classic.\u000a

V\u000aIn my personal view, any person in the world who understands English,\u000awould never say some thing wrong about this movie. If some does\u000aunderstands English and still says something wrong about this movie, it\u000ameans he has not seen the movie. If some one understands English and\u000ahas seen this movie as well, and still he says something bad about this\u000amovie, it means he has a really bad taste regarding movies or he does\u000anot know what a movie is.

V\u000aI'm constantly amazed by the praise heaped on this film. I've always\u000aseen it as a good film, but too clichéd to rate as as truly great one.On the plus side, it has high production values, has a good performance\u000afrom Tim Robbins as Andy Dufresne, and it's well-paced until close to\u000athe end.But the downsides are legion.First of all, some of the secondary characters are utterly\u000atwo-dimensional (particularly Warden Norton and Captain Hadley). They\u000alumber through the film as such obvious and simplistic bad guys that\u000athey may as well have moustaches and wear black hats.Secondly, the film cranks out every prison cliché in the book. The\u000aassaults, the corrupt wardens, the ex-con who can't handle the outside\u000aworld, the withdrawals of privileges - all have been done before and\u000awith considerably more impact.Thirdly, there are plot holes you could crawl through (as Andy does!).\u000aThe notion that Andy Dufresne could dig a tunnel for 20 years without\u000abeing spotted isn't up-lifting, it's ridiculous. Did no-one feel the\u000adraught? Did no-one lean against the poster when they visited him in\u000ahis cell? As a resolution, it's not clever, just silly.And the finale (from the tunnel to the beach) is overlong and\u000aoverwrought.And yet there are standout sequences. The scene where Andy locks\u000ahimself into the Warden's office and blasts an aria from Mozart's\u000aMarriage of Figaro over the prison Tannoy is sublime and haunting.An enjoyable way to pass a couple of hours, but no more than that.\u000a

V\u000aI would recommend this movie to everyone. The acting, directing,\u000acinematography are all top notch. The cast are so good that its hard to\u000aimagine anyone else in those roles. If this movie does not make you\u000alaugh and then at, the very least, make you cry a little bit, then you\u000ahave no soul.The greatest movie never to have won an academy award - no doubt. The\u000agreatest movie of all time - possiblyIf you have never seen this movie you are lucky, because i will never\u000aagain be able to see it for the first time.A truly heart-warming and\u000ainspiring piece of cinema. Awesome\u000a

V\u000aI am new to commenting on movies, so maybe I shouldn't have started\u000awith trying to put the Shawshank Redemption into words. The themes of\u000ahope, depression, friendship, greed, and triumph connect with the best\u000aacting I have ever seen in a movie. The actors are so good, you begin\u000ato look at Morgan Freeman in real life as "Red" and Tim Robbins as\u000a"Andy". The humor is ever present, such as conversations held by the\u000ainmates. But perhaps the very best thing for an average viewer is the\u000aconstant surprises. I'm not talking about monsters jumping from trees,\u000aI'm talking about how every time the movie starts to seem to get slow\u000aBAM! something happens that represents one of the themes. If you have\u000anot seen this movie, maybe because the fact that it is a "prison\u000amovie," or maybe because it is now eleven years old, you have missed\u000aout on a life experience. It is my favorite movie of all time and\u000aalways will be. The 9.1 rating on IMDb is so well earned and\u000aunderrated.\u000a

V\u000aI know lots has been said about this film since it bombed at the box\u000aoffice then became a hit through video rental. I am probably not going\u000ato add anything new. I am a Stephen King fan, and have a policy not to\u000awatch the films made from the books as they usually turn out to be\u000aquite dodgy. However, I was urged by a friend to give it a go and I was\u000anot disappointed. This film is about hope and redemption and the\u000acharacterisations are faithful to the original story.Tim Robbins is perfect in the lead role, quietly enigmatic, just as I\u000ahad pictured when reading the book.The movie is quite old fashioned in concept but don't let this deter\u000ayou. You are taken through the whole spectrum of human emotions and end\u000aup feeling better because of watching it. The relationship between the\u000atwo lead men is charming and kind of restores your faith in human\u000anature.You must watch this movie whether or not you have seen it before,\u000abecause it makes you feel good.This film will end up being a perennial classic up there with the likes\u000aof "it's a wonderful life" and "the wizard of oz".I can't think of a single criticism.\u000a

V\u000aI cant find another word to describe this movie. AMAZING! The title is\u000aso horrible and i never expected i would watch it for 30 minutes. But\u000awhen i saw it, i realised the big mistake in not watching it earlier.The movie has a beautiful plot set over 20 years. Every part of the\u000amovie has a bearing on the ending. And never did i imagine such a\u000aspectacular ending. Not many movies can boast of a suspense of such a\u000akind. This movie is not a thriller, nor is it adventure; but it is a\u000adesire of a Man who lives on Hope and who paves his own Destiny.\u000aShawshank Redemption leaves you with a elated mind and a moral that it\u000ais fear that holds you back and Hope that carries you forward. I have\u000aonly one message for IMDb viewers. Just watch Shawshank Redemption. Do\u000anot avoid it because the title is bad or else you too will have the\u000asame wretched feeling that i had today. Wish i had seen it when i did\u000ahave an opportunity a decade ago. Well.. sometimes, cinema is like\u000athis. You go for titles, stars and big buck films and come back home\u000adisappointed. But Shawshank Redemption proves that all you need is a\u000aexcellent script, a good director and some thespians like Morgan\u000aFreeman and Tim Robbins.\u000a

V\u000aMany of the most powerful stories are the soulful ones that teach us\u000anot to despair, not to be swamped by sorrow. They remind us that ¡°\u000ahope¡± is a precious and buoyant emotion that can give our lives\u000asubstance and meaning. Most people who see this movie for the first\u000atime are not going to appreciate it completely, I feel that it is quite\u000apossible the best movie ever made. Some may be more entertaining, like\u000asay Indian Jones and the last Crusade, but none as compelling. The\u000amovie shows a world of different emotions, mainly through its two main\u000acharacters, Red and Andy. The acting is incredible. The message is\u000astronger than that of most any movie, and is stated very clearly. ¡°\u000aHope¡± is a good thing, maybe the best of things, and no good thing\u000aever does.¡± After being drained by the sad events that occur in the\u000amovie, the ending uplifts, and thoroughly fulfills the gap that it\u000acould leave you with.I believe that one reason that this movie is under appreciated is that\u000apeople have not seen it multiple times. At first viewing it is the\u000astory of Andy and his struggle to maintain hope despite his\u000acircumstances. However, this is really a movie about Red and his\u000astruggle to find meaning and purpose. The final segment of the movie\u000atestifies to the fact that the final resolution of the story comes\u000aabout only when Red is faced with the same fearful situation as Brooks.\u000aBecause of Andy, Red can find different path of freedom that is lit by\u000ahope. No matter what circumstances you live in, don¡¯t forget that hope\u000ais the best thing in the world. And you will have courage to struggle,\u000ato forward, and to live better in the world.\u000a

V\u000a\u000aStrong, meaningful and everlasting message is what makes this movie such\u000apowerful.\u000aThe Hope, the Life and the Friendship are elements of Great Impact and are\u000awell incorporated in this feature. But, lots of flaws also. This movie lacks\u000aoriginality. Approach, characters and dialogues are rather cliched and mold.\u000aPortraying of characters is loose and poor. Dialogues are pretty ordinary\u000aand too conventional. Overall approach is just Routine and  the whole movie\u000ais based on the Final Impact of  the story. In short, its actually not\u000asurprising no Oscar winning and no including into the 100 Greatest Movies by\u000aAmerican Film Institute. Greater Effort in developing characters to be\u000amultidimensional and story to be less conventional would produce One of the\u000aBest. Pity. 7,5/10\u000a

V\u000a\u000aMany reviews talk about how they don't have words that can describe this\u000amovie.  I have the perfect word: vanilla\u000aThis movie is the Toyota Camry of movies.  Pleasant, but bland.  It\u000adoesn't\u000atake any risks, just plays it safe and the result is a pleasant\u000aexperience,\u000abut not a satisfying one.\u000aI would have liked to see more risks taken.  How about some\u000aground-breaking\u000acinematography?  What if some of the characters pushed the envelope a\u000alittle\u000afurther?  Far enough to be accused of overacting by some?  How about a\u000aparallel story?  How about SEVERAL parallel stories?\u000aWhat about moving the story at a faster pace?  The beginning of the movie\u000awas really quite slow...There is no reason this movie should be more than\u000a2\u000ahours.  I give it only a 7 out of 10 for breaking no new ground.  I think\u000athis movie fails to distinguish itself in my memory.\u000a

V\u000a\u000aThis wasn't a bad movie by any means, in fact it was pretty good. Good\u000astory, good acting, fairly dramatic, it has most of the key elements in\u000aplace. But after reading the book, which was amazing, watching this drawn\u000aout film version just isn't the same. Compared to some of the modern junk\u000athat's out there, Shawshank is pretty solid. But overall, it truly is\u000aoverrated, and #2 all time is silly. \u000a

This film is still\u000awell worth seeing but the characters are not as well crafted as in 'The\u000aGreen Mile' nor do they command your compassion (Brooks\u000aexcepted).I suppose I'd better see 'Hannibal' SOON!\u000a

V\u000a\u000aGood Movie. The first time I saw it, when it first came out in 1994, I\u000athought that it was fantastic. But now that I have seen it approaching 15\u000atimes now (thanks to TNT), there a few things that I have noticed that have\u000aconvinced me it does not deserve to be in the top ten or even the top 50 of\u000aall time.I find the film to be unrealistic. The prison seems to exist in some sort of\u000ahyper-reality where people are either bad guys or good guys but there is\u000aabsolutely no grey area. The prison and the prisoners are also very clean,\u000aneither have the lived-in quality that you would expect. I do not know if\u000athis feeling I get from the movie was on-purpose by the director Darabont,\u000abut I feel as the though the authenticity of the movie is not there. I also\u000afeel as though the movie is very manipulative of the audience's emotions in\u000athe way that the story is used to make the viewer feel a certain way about a\u000acharacter. Of course all movies are manipulative in this way. But I am very\u000aaware of it when I watch Shawshank. I was also aware of it when I watch\u000amovies like The Green Mile or The Hurricane, I feel as though these movies\u000ado not give the audience an opportunity to decide for themselves. Lastly I\u000athink that this movie was carried by the supreme acting, and that if the\u000aFreeman and Robbins were not so good it would not even deserve to be in the\u000atop 250.Otherwise, I rooted for this movie get the oscar in 1994 because I thought\u000ait was a superior movie to Forest Gump.\u000a

There is no acting in any other film that comes close to Tim\u000aRobbins\u000aand especially Morgan Freeman.  I fail to see how anyone could fault any\u000apart of this film it is, in my opinion, perfect.  The plot line is great\u000aand\u000athere is no way you could guess what is coming next and the ending is\u000acompletely unpredictable.    \u000a

V\u000a\u000aWhen I first saw this movie i was 16 and wasn't allowed in the theatre since\u000ait was rated R.  I asked some of the people standing in line if they would\u000alet me come in with them.  I don't know why I wanted to see it so much(the\u000atrailer wasn't that great).  But when I sat down and watched that opening\u000asequence where the judge slams down that gavel for the poor Mr Dufresne and\u000aRed comes walkin in to the parol board i knew i was in for something\u000aspecial.  The cinematography  of that old prison was amazing.  As we hear\u000amore dialog coming from the two main characters our hearts go out to these\u000a"brave souls".  The character development is better than in any movie i've\u000aseen for a while.  You really start to care and feel for these imaginary\u000apeople as if you knew them.  The more times i watch it on my laserdisc\u000aplayer, the more I can't believe how anyone could not at least "like" this\u000amasterpiece of filmmaking.  It really got the shaft at the oscars.  Tim\u000aRobbins should have at least been nominated.  I still don't think forrest\u000agump had as much to offer about the human experience as "THE SHAWSHANK\u000aREDEMPTION".  It really is a fantastic piece of work. Writing, acting,\u000adirection, and cinematography come together in this masterpiece.\u000a\u000a

V\u000aMy favorite movie was really The Godfather until I saw The Shawshank\u000aRedemption.A lot of people would might disagree with, but I love this movie. the\u000aactors are great, the director has done a fantastic job and the\u000ascreenplay is magnificent.I was so impressed with how every single subplot was given a great deal\u000aof respect and attention from the director. The acting was world-class.\u000aI have never seen Tim Robbins act as well since, Morgan Freeman maybe\u000a(e.g. Seven). The twists were unexpected, an although this film had a\u000afamiliar feel, it wasn't even slightly pretentious or clichéd, it was\u000aoriginal. The cinematography was grand and expressive. It gave a real\u000aimpression of the sheer magnitude of this daunting prison.I remember, when i saw the movie I didn't want to get up and go to the\u000atoilet. When I finally was done in the bathroom, I couldn't wait to get\u000aback and press play on my DVD. At the time I was done with the movie I\u000awanted to see the movie again.This film manages to redeem Hollywood in the eyes of people who feared\u000ait long lost in a dark sea of clichés and predictability. Darabont\u000ashows us that artists still work in the Hollywood studios and\u000aproduction facilities. These artists show their capability to produce\u000aart; real art that inspires you to look at the deeper aspects of life\u000aand the world around you. The Shawshank Redemption delivers much-needed\u000abreath of fresh air for anyone who realizes the capability of film. It\u000aproves that masters of the craft still live on this earth, and still\u000abless us with timeless masterpieces that we will never forget. So see it, buy it, love it.\u000a

V\u000aThis film should be joint along with The Godfather as being the\u000agreatest film of all time. The character development and the messages\u000athat is conveying is beautifully done. When the messages such as hope,\u000afriendship and survival come together, it makes an excellent display.It consisted of different metaphors when they were drinking the liquor\u000aon top the roof, and Morgan Freeman was narrating his thoughts as\u000afeeling that they were a free man, this was the best moment of the film\u000aand made me how at that time people were living in jails.Excellent. Prefect. Outstanding film, best jail film I saw in my entire\u000alife...10/10 PS watch out for the new drama that came out in the UK...\u000aPrison Break on channel five. If you liked Shawshank then you will like\u000athis.\u000a

V\u000aFilmmakers that plan to make use of Stephen King's writings in the\u000afuture need to pull an Orson Welles and watch this about 40 times\u000abefore they get into it. And read the short story just as many times.\u000aThis is the best transfer of a Stephen King story I've ever seen. I\u000awould give it to Kubrick's The Shining, but it's more like Kubrick took\u000athe story idea and did his own movie on it. In other words, while it's\u000aa classic, it's not that great of an adaption. Andy Dufresne is wrongly\u000aimprisoned for murdering his philanderous wife and while in prison\u000abefriends a prisoner named Red, who is great at getting outside\u000aproducts to the inmates. The message of the film is strong and clear :\u000aHope Hope Hope is a beautiful thing. The film is about triumph. About\u000afriendship. It's also about some knockout acting. Tim Robbins and\u000aMorgan Freeman are at the top of their game. A Must see. Especially if\u000ayou are a fan of Stephen King's short story.\u000a

V\u000aThe Shawshank Redemption, based on the fantastic Stephen King novel, is\u000aa moving story about Andy Dufresne, an innocent man charged with the\u000amurder of his wife and her lover who is sentenced to 40 years in prison\u000aand fights hard to survive, but in prison he forms a rare and close\u000afriendship with fellow inmate Ellis 'Red' Redding. The film more or\u000aless focuses on the friendship between Andy and Red, played beautifully\u000aby Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman, Morgan's deep and moving voice was\u000aperfect to describe the closeness of his friendship with Andy. The film\u000ahad a great happy ending where Andy escaped from the prison after\u000aserving almost 20 years, he also managed to expose the prison as there\u000awas murder and corruption going on there, Andy moves to a beautiful\u000aisland abroad and when Red is paroled after serving 40 years in prison\u000ahe is reunited with Andy, it was a great ending to a beautiful movie.\u000a

V\u000a\u000aThere is no reason for this movie to be above Citizen Kane, Godfather 2,\u000aetc.  It is a good enjoyable movie yes.  But it is also cheesy at times and\u000aa little bit pretentious. I believe what works for this movie is that it\u000ahas\u000aa sort of "everyman" charm to it. It is a movie that an entire family can\u000asit and watch and enjoy.  Yet, if one digs deeper into it, those that know\u000amovies should be able to see its weaknesses. Its dialogue for one is not\u000avery strong.  The performances are solid, but I believe I have seen Morgan\u000aFreeman do this role better many times before.  Is this a better prison\u000amovie than say... "Murder in the First"? Probably, but is it sooo much\u000abetter that this film deserves to be number 2 all time.  THink about\u000athat...\u000athe second best film EVER. Somehow I doubt that. \u000a

Well..I'm an old\u000aStephen King fan and the story of "Redemtion" is good and thrilling and\u000athe acting and photography is good as well but its nothing that has'nt\u000abeen made before. don't get me wrong i liked it but i think its just a\u000awell made entertaining picture and nothing more.So watch it and have a good time but don't expect an artistically great\u000awork or something all too original.\u000a

V\u000aAndy Dufresne (Tim Robbins) is convicted of murdering his wife and her\u000alover, and is sent to Shawshank prison: For Life. Andy is a very\u000aintelligent man, a hot shot banker when he was free, and now he's just\u000aa number, at the mercy of Warden Norton (Bob Gunton) and his head\u000aguard, Byron Hadley (Clancy Brown).Andy is a quiet man, but manages to attract the attention of the\u000asisters (Barely Human Homosexual rapists) led by Bogs (Mark Rolston)\u000aand he begins his prison life, desperately fighting his admirers,\u000asometimes he'd win, sometimes he'd lose, but he always stayed quiet.Red (Morgan Freeman) is the man who can get things, and he is Andy's\u000afirst friend on the inside. We witness Andy's relationships with Red,\u000athe Guards, the Warden, the sisters and the rest of the inmates,\u000adevelop through Morgan Freeman's perspective, but always revolving\u000aaround Andy. In his time there he successfully wins personal battles,\u000agains favour with the guards and inmates alike, and restructures the\u000arehabilitation of so many with his unwavering persistence and drive.All the members of the cast are more than adequate, but i have to\u000asingle out Freeman and Robbins. Freeman guides the viewing audience in\u000aan informative and subtle manner, and Robbins, in his finest\u000aperformance ever, gives us hope and wisdom, as he manipulates the\u000apowers around him so cleverly, to make life as easy as he can for all\u000ahis fellow inmates.The Movie is very powerful and moving throughout, and it doesn't shy\u000aaway from the darker aspects of prison life. And at the end when the\u000aclimax falls into place, you will be left completely satisfied by its\u000aunquestionable brilliance.For those who have not seen this movie, all i can say is watch it.10/10\u000a

V\u000a** Some spoilers about the general storyline **I had some expectations regarding this movie, because of the excellent\u000arating it got here. To start with the positive: the acting (especially\u000aby the two protagonists) is indeed of the highest level, and some\u000ascenes really grip you. The camera-work is also excellent (beautiful\u000aprison-building!)The story of this movie is a 13-in-a-dozen story about someone who (of\u000acourse) is wrongly sentenced to a long story; who meets his new friend\u000a(mostly an elderly person), who makes enemies and defeats them, who\u000aturns his long-stay into something good, then is betrayed by his\u000acorrupt warden, etc. etc. Sometimes it even got a bit cheesy, the way\u000ain which all the prison cliché's were displayed.I could recommend this movie to you, if you are looking for a nice\u000adrama with good acting and good camera. Don't expect an Oscar-worthy\u000amovie, though.\u000a

Imagine my surprise, almost 10 years later, when it's rated the\u000a#2\u000amovie ever made by IMDB users! Having finally had a chance to see the\u000amovie,\u000aI'm still just as surprised.This isn't a bad movie. It's a good movie. In some ways, it's a very good\u000amovie. But it's certainly not a great movie. Better than Casablanca?\u000aBetter\u000athan Citizen Kane? Better than The Seven Samurai? I don't think so. As\u000acornball melodrama, it's not even better than the first Star Wars. What\u000acould possibly account for this movie's inexplicable popularity?As I say, it's not a bad movie. The acting is generally good, and Freeman\u000aand Robbins are both typically excellent. Roger Deakins' photography is,\u000aof\u000acourse, gorgeous. The story itself is compelling (a "page-turner"), as\u000aare\u000amost of Stephen King's stories.Yet under it all, the story is just as much a fantasy as any of King's\u000ahorror novels. While it's presented as a serious drama about prison life\u000aand\u000athe tenacity of the human spirit (and make no mistake, every emotion,\u000aevery\u000asignificant action in this movie is foreshadowed, highlighted and\u000agenerally\u000atelegraphed to the degree that there's absolutely no doubt as to how the\u000adirector expects you to react), the storyline and characters are so\u000asimplistically drawn that the movie wouldn't have rung significantly less\u000atrue if an army of vampires had appeared in the final reel. This is a\u000amawkish, sentimental and highly manipulative movie where the evil\u000acharacters\u000aare pure, unadulturated evil and the good characters are the unsullied\u000aembodiment of pure nobility. It's the male equivalent of one of those\u000aLifetime Channel movies where the woman's abusive boyfriend sleeps with\u000aher\u000asister, steals her car, poisons her cat and kidnaps her developmentally\u000adisabled daughter to another state. It's pure melodrama, and while the\u000agreat\u000aperformances and photography make it enjoyable to watch, they can't\u000achange\u000athe fact that it is, Freeman's voice-over notwithstanding, a fairy tale.It's hard to really care for anyone in this movie because the characters\u000aand\u000atheir struggles are so completely cliched and cartoony. There never seems\u000ato\u000abe the least chance of Robbins' sprit being broken and the rest of the\u000aprisoners rarely seem any more perturbed by their incarceration than the\u000aprisoners on "Hogan's Heroes". There is something of a plot twist near\u000athe\u000aend, but it's telegraphed almost two hours in advance and there isn't\u000areally\u000aany question of the movie ending up any differently than it does. What\u000awe're\u000aleft with is a beautifully-filmed, well-acted movie without the slightest\u000ahint of subtlety, nuance or ambiguity. This is the sort of movie where\u000ait's\u000anot enough to give the hypocritical, self-righteously religious warden a\u000awall hanging that says "His judgement cometh, and that right soon." We\u000aalso\u000ahave to cut to a quick shot of the hanging right before the warden gets\u000ahis\u000acomeuppance, just to make sure that not one single person in the audience\u000amisses the incredible irony.It's supposed to be a celebration of the triumph of the spirit, but since\u000athere never seems to be the slightest chance that Robbins' spirit *won't*\u000atriumph, we're left with no more genuine suspense than we would get\u000awaiting\u000afor the cavalry to appear in an old-time western. What could have been an\u000aabove-average B-movie has been turned into an overwrought, ham-handed,\u000apretentious melodrama.\u000a\u000a

V\u000a\u000aI don't want to offend anyone, some of you actually seem quite\u000aintelligent,\u000abut listen up: If a movie is on the on top 250 list, in this case second\u000afrom top, it simply states that this film is the second best liked film in\u000athe "IMDB" world. You can't argue that it don't deserve it just because it\u000aaren't as creative, innovative, artistic or influential as many other\u000afilms\u000aare. "THE SECOND BEST LIKED"! It's a fact. Swallow the truth.Movie lovers, as opposed to the general movie enjoyer, have, like most\u000adisciples of art a much more developed, or trained mind when it comes down\u000ato their field of obsession and will choose accordingly. (You can't expect\u000ayour classmates to love jazz, prog rock and classical music, just because\u000ayou do.) Shawshank Redemtion is, obviously, generaly an enormously\u000alikeable\u000amovie and even some of the most artsy people people I know accept it as\u000avalid and enjoyable entertainment. In my book it rates a solid 9/10. It's\u000aindeed, along with Back to the future (that ranks high much because it hit\u000ame so hard in my early youth.), my favourite mainstream movie of all\u000atime!FJL from Norway \u000a

V\u000a\u000aLet me review this film on two aspects: it's merit and it's high\u000aplacement.First of all, ask yourself this question: Is a film great simply because it\u000aachieves? I hope many think this is not the case. Shawshank has a slow and\u000amethodical pace. Along with good performances around the board. The simple\u000astaging and lighting of the film is over-done in it's simplicity and I\u000apersonally see no art in it at all. But, I'm not saying it's a bad film.\u000aIt's not, and it's far from it. But to be ranked over vastly more\u000aintelligent efforts is a sad reflection on our society.The writing is top-notch. The best thing about the film is the flow of the\u000astory, and I could have simply read a book. I am no huge fan of visual\u000aeffects or quick paced story-telling ... but I am a fan of art. Reading a\u000abook would be as enthralling as watching this film. Seeing the acting is\u000alike watching lines being delivered, but being delivered\u000awell.As for it's rating on the site ... the film pushes no boundaries in which\u000afilm often offends people to the point of disliking it. It has a nice\u000auplifting story at the end and presses a lot of hot buttons. Including\u000amurder, infidelity, and scandal. Searching for the soundtrack for this film is what brought me to IMDb for\u000athe first time, actually. So I dare not say this is a bad film; I only say\u000ait's ranked higher than vastly superior films.Rating: C+\u000a

V\u000a\u000aI too was dazzled by this movie when I first saw it; Robbins and Freeman\u000awere both fabulous and the story was an intensely happy marriage of the\u000anostalgic and edifying to the tense and disturbing. The theme of success\u000aagainst the odds is rarely so emotive, and the desperate hope and yearning\u000aare truly palpable.But it's simply NOT the best film of all time! Parts of it are cliched,\u000amost\u000aof it is downright implausible. The symbolism is trite and way too\u000ain-your-face, particularly with Freeman explicitly spelling out (albeit\u000atouchingly) what should have been the movie's duty to portray.The ending was a shameless exercise in trying to make the world feel better\u000athan it's ever felt before. Films have\u000aevery right to be manipulative, but when it's this blatant the magic\u000acollapses. Or did for me anyway.Mind you, still a smashing flick. I'm only nit-picking because everybody\u000aelse seems to be in such a weird frenzy of Shawshank worship.\u000a\u000a

V\u000aThe Shawshank Redemption offers a life lesson; that no matter what,\u000ahope must never be lost. Hope is a good thing. In addition, it shows\u000athe true benefits of friendship, of those that care for you.Andy Dufresne was sentenced to two life sentences for the murders of\u000ahis wife and the "fella she was banging." Inside, he meets Red. Red\u000awill learn a lesson from Andy, that hope cannot be stripped from you,\u000ano matter what is done to you, no matter what happens, no matter how we\u000asuffer, hope will always be there to comfort us. Andy's education gets\u000ahim benefits with the warden, who makes him his "financial pet" for his\u000amoney laundering activities. He does not know however, that his world\u000ais going to come crashing down on him.This movie has had a very poignant and influential impact on myself. I\u000ado not get tired of seeing it, and every time I do, I feel like nothing\u000ain this world can hurt me. Only one word comes to my mind when\u000adescribing the power and beauty of this movie. Perfect.Hope will set you free.\u000a

V\u000a"The Shawshank Redemption" should have won Best Picture for 1994. A\u000astory of banker Andy Dufresne (Tim Robbins) getting falsely convicted\u000aof murder and sent to the hellish Shawshank prison, the movie is beyond\u000aamazing. In prison, Andy meets Ellis Boyd "Red" Redding (Morgan\u000aFreeman), who was imprisoned many years earlier. Red gets Andy a poster\u000aof Rita Hayworth. Over the next twenty years, Andy experiences all the\u000ahorrors that one would expect in jail: beatings by the guards, rapes by\u000aother inmates, and so on. But he never gives up hope.This movie, like "Carrie", "The Shining", "Dolores Claiborne", "The\u000aGreen Mile" and "Hearts in Atlantis", just goes to show what a great\u000aauthor Stephen King is. When we think of horror, we think of spooky\u000ahorror, but "The Shawshank Redemption" is a different kind: personal\u000ahorror. Pure genius. I can only hope that in the coming years, this\u000amovie is recognized as what it is: a masterpiece. I can't believe that\u000ait won no Oscars!\u000a

V\u000aI have a friend who hasn't seen the Shawshank Redemption, and his\u000acomment was essentially this: "I hate prison movies, and I hate\u000areligion movies, so I'm not gonna see a flick that has both aspects in\u000ait." His loss. This movie, based on a Stephen King novella, is on my\u000aall-time top ten. Of course it has morals and many lessons we can\u000alearn, but bottom line, it is a great movie. Even though we know that\u000aTim Robbins is innocent, he acknowledges his guilt on a more subtle\u000alevel, his failure to be a good person. That he is in prison affords\u000ahim the opportunity to become a "good" man for the first time in his\u000alife. He touches the soul of many inmates, in that he educates them in\u000asome of the finer things in life, namely, good music and great\u000aliterature. (He corrects an inmate's pronunciation of Alexandre Dumas'\u000alast name from "Dumbass" to the correct "Dumah") The last quarter of\u000athe movie is spot-on great. We are always touched by redemption themes,\u000ajust look at how popular "Scrooge" and "It's a Wonderful Life" have\u000abecome over the years. Shawshank simply is too good to miss.\u000a

V\u000aShawshank Redemption is one of those infamous movies you never stop\u000ahearing about if you are a crazed movie fanatic. I've been through the\u000aentire top 250 list up and down and this is going back and fourth\u000abetween #2 and #3 struggling with Lord of the Rings: The Retrun of the\u000aKing. I had to see this movie to see what all the fuss is about.Based on Stephen King's novel, The Shawshank Redemption is a terrific\u000aadaptation of his book. The acting, I mean don't get me started. Tim\u000aRobbins and Morgan Freeman were perfectly casted and fit so well\u000atogether. What I mean in my title to my summary is, I felt that I could\u000arelate. This reminded me so much of my friendship with my best friend,\u000abecause her and I are so close and would do anything for each other.\u000aEven wait until the end of time just to hang out and talk again.I felt this story also brought up major important points, what does a\u000aconvict do after so many years in prison? Pretty much a good job is out\u000aof the question, same with a decent place. Your family might disown you\u000aand everything you knew was in that prison. It's sort of like being\u000ashoved from a lake to an ocean and you're drowning with no life\u000apreserver. This movie actually got me thinking about that.Also there is the final notion of the court systems, because we are\u000aalso dealing with Tim Robbin's life. He keeps claiming his innocence\u000aand no one will listen to him or believe him. I felt awful for him, I\u000aknow there are a lot of men and women in prison who are innocent and\u000aare paying for other people's crimes.I would highly recommend The Shawshank Redemption, I believe it's\u000abetter than Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King. So watch it and\u000aunderstand this movie, it's important. This should be watched by\u000aeveryone and you get out of the movie what you bring into it.10/10\u000a

V\u000a\u000aGood acting from all concerned carries the rather simplistic and obvious\u000astoryline beyond the saccharine, but the villains are really predictable in\u000atheir villany and the storyline, while initially moving and affecting, seems\u000aforced and unreal once you step back from Robbins and Freeman's\u000aperformances.In other words, a high impact movie that rapidly loses credibility with\u000aconsidered thought after viewing. Far more worthwhile, though, than many\u000aother similarly stretched dramas and by no means a failure. But by no means\u000ain the top rank of movie making.\u000a

V\u000aSome consider it a masterpiece, some just an example of experienced\u000afilm-making. I'm sticking with the second opinion. I really do like The\u000aShawshank Redemption, mainly because of its actors, but it remains a\u000amovie which pretends to tell a shocking story while using\u000ablack-and-white schemes, unlikely characters (Andy Dufresne makes some\u000asaints look like amateurs) and incomplete character backgrounds. It is\u000autterly unauthentic wherever you bother to question its settings or\u000acharacters.A better prison movie should at least give the audience an idea of what\u000arape, the loss of freedom, the loss of contact to your family and\u000afriends, bad conditions and dullness can really do to a person.I like the movie when it manages to show me how Brooks isn't able to\u000aadapt the outside world anymore. I find it mediocre when it tries to\u000atell me the story of true friendship, strength and hope itself lying\u000awithin a prison. I do not like it when it sells me men who manage to\u000aget through such hard times without developing any kind of trauma or\u000anegative characteristics.\u000a

V\u000a\u000aThis bloated and soggy piece of work is so far from earning a number 2\u000aspot on the IMDb that I have to imagine that Stephen King has bought\u000avotes for it. Trite , mawkish, shallow, unconvincing, ugly... How much\u000amore can I say about its awfulness? Morgan Freeman is tolerable, Tim\u000aRobbins is not. There is a romantic glow to the cinematography that is\u000areally inappropriate if the main characters are heterosexual. If they\u000aaren't there is an unexplored subtext poisoning the base of the movie.\u000aThere is nothing else about this movie that makes a lick of sense:\u000aemotional, dramatic, logical, racial, penological. Rips off the Count\u000aof Monte Cristo and Huckleberry Finn and cheapens and flattens them.\u000aIts appeal escapes me utterly. For the love of God, sink this film!\u000a\u000a

V\u000a\u000aI finally decided to see this film after reading good reviews and noting\u000athat this film ranks in IMDB's top ten list (currently #2). At the very\u000aleast I disovered where all the noble people are: they're in\u000aprison!The film is decent, but it certainly isn't what I would call great or\u000aextraordinary. There are good performances by Robbins and Freeman, but\u000athe\u000apace of the movie is very slow and the cinematography is unremarkable.\u000aCharacters are largely stereotypes, the story is somewhat formulaic (and\u000asometimes ludicrous), and the noble prisoners vs wicked guards dichotomy\u000ais\u000asimplistic and unrealistic. I was also particularly annoyed at the\u000anarration, which always seemed to explain more than it needed to. As for\u000athe\u000aending, I guess I was not as suprised as others since I did read the\u000aStephen\u000aKing novella many years ago. Still, given that the story takes place in a\u000aprison, you don't need to be a genius to guess part of\u000ait.This movie reminds me of Dead Poets Society in terms of its tone and\u000atheme\u000aof uplifting the human spirit against a backdrop of despair. If that's\u000ayour\u000athing, you'll love the movie. It's not really my thing.5/10\u000a

V\u000aIt is the most basic of all principles of film-making: A story of\u000aredemption. This time the story is set inside Shawshank Prison, where\u000asuccessful banker Andy Dufresne (Tim Robbins) is sent to during the\u000a40s, after being falsely accused of murdering his wife and her lover.\u000aThe jail veteran, Red (Morgan Freeman), sees Andy being forced through\u000athe front gates of the jail on his first day of arrival and sees him as\u000aa weakling. Red even makes a bet with the fellow inmates that he won't\u000alast. He's wrong.Andy does last, and becomes an inspiration to all of those behind bars.\u000aThe warden of the jail, Samuel Norton (Bob Gunton), is intent on\u000abringing down Andy and his defiant nature, as all villains always are.That is the prevailing message, I suppose. The redemption comes\u000atwo-fold -- Andy is given time to reflect upon his life in Shawshank,\u000aand Red (who is obviously deeply moved by Andy's influence) learns a\u000athing or two, going through a cleansing process. We see the gradual\u000achange, too -- first Red is the cynical veteran, then the curious\u000ainsider, then the close friend, then the surprised object of\u000aredemption. As strange a title it may be, "The Shawshank Redemption" is\u000aa worthy one.At the end of the day, "Shawshank" is a good film - but far from a\u000aperfect one. I'm not interested in responding to its Top 250 placement\u000awith my review (as countless others have done), but the fact that it\u000ahas been voted into the number one slot is a reflection of how\u000auniversal its appeal is: it's about as likable and mass-marketed as\u000apossible. There's nothing here to really offend or provoke and the film\u000adoesn't take enough changes to potentially polarize audiences -- it\u000aplays it safe, and in my opinion, a bit too safe. The film's message of\u000ahope and redemption is way too heavy-handed, the outcome being a movie\u000athat is very simple and easy to digest -- but not really very\u000ainteresting beyond its surface. It speaks volumes that so many people\u000awho have gone through depression often reference this as one of the\u000aaids they used for comfort -- it's a movie that pats people on the back\u000aand gives them hope and inspiration. That's a great message, but if you provide it without any challenge to\u000athe audience -- and instead just spoon feed it -- well, for me, anyway,\u000ait doesn't leave much of an impact. It's just a well-made but\u000amanipulative and self-important film.\u000a

V\u000a\u000aThe Shawshank Redemption is with out a doubt one of the most over rated\u000afilms of the 90s.  There have been many intriguing prison movies over the\u000ayears, Shawshank is not one of them. Instead it's sentimental slop served to\u000auplift the souls of the American people.  There is never any sense in the\u000afilm that Tim Robbin's character is in true danger.  If the film wanted to\u000ashow the true horror of prison maybe it should of been far more darker,\u000ainstead of inspiration. Morgan Freeman is wasted as usual, in the role of\u000awisdom spouting inmate. Freeman's character is mainly there to look wise and\u000abring inspiration to us all, but he is never treated as a typical person.\u000aTim Robbins is good, but his character is all good, while the prison warden\u000ais sure evil. Everything is black and white.  Shawshank has potential to be\u000agreat, but director Frank Darabant's obsession with being Frank Capra ruins\u000athe film at every turn.  \u000a

This movie insulted my intelligence from the\u000afirst minute. All the prison clichés are painfully represented in this\u000aone film. The Innocent lead character, the benevolent inmate friend,\u000athe evil warden, the sadistic guard, etc.. Then of course you are\u000amesmerized by the hackneyed subplots and obligatory scenes (i.e.) the\u000aattempted rape. About the only ingredient not thrown into this\u000aproverbial soup was a football game.This movie has some fine acting and direction, but considering its big\u000aname cast and production, the product is sophomoric at best.\u000a

V\u000aOver the years many IMDb users have wondered why "The Shawshank\u000aRedemption" was ranked so high, and many "wished" that in time it would\u000asink to a lower, more appropriate slot. Many analyses missed the mark.\u000aFollowing is the real reason it is ranked so high, and why it will\u000anever sink much, if any. And I hope it never does.This film deals with several "hot" buttons in us. A cheating spouse. A\u000ahusband wrongly convicted and sent to prison. Corrupt law enforcement.\u000aA prison where inmates get maimed or killed. A smart inmate who plots a\u000abrilliant escape. The corrupt warden getting his just reward. Two\u000afriends being re-united with a good life ahead of them. Combined with a\u000agood script and good cinematography. What's not to like about this\u000astory?I have seen this movie a number of times. Each time I get something new\u000aout of it that I either didn't see before, or had not made a mental\u000aconnection to. I recently (year 2014) upgraded my personal copy from\u000aDVD to Blu-Ray and both the picture and sound are better. This film continues to spark the occasional argument of whether it\u000areally should be rated on IMDb as the top film of all time. I don't\u000aknow exactly where "Shawshank Redemption" should rank on the all-time\u000alist. That is akin to comparing home run hitters or golfers from\u000adifferent centuries. The games are quite different, as is true in\u000acinema. I gave this film a "10", and on my list it is in one of the\u000abest movies of all time, along with a number of others. At the same\u000atime, I recognize that everyone else has a different opinion. I don't\u000areally see any value in trying to decide a rank order for all time.\u000aEach film should be appreciated for what it has to offer, no more, and\u000ano less.\u000a

It is an extraordinary motion that people "will" be talking about\u000ain 50 or 100 years. Stephen King"s novel adaption best movie... Stephen\u000aKing's story is brought to the screen with great elegance and\u000aexcitement. It tells a lesson about life. It's a poignant story about\u000ahope. Hope gets me.... It's also a story for freedom. Freedom from\u000aisolation, from rule, from bigotry and hate. Freeman and Robbins are\u000amajestic in their performances.\u000a

V\u000aSo is this the best of all time? For me personally no, but its def in\u000athe top 20, and I think this is probably true for most people. It is\u000athe most consistent highly rated movie, that's why it is the best. The\u000afriendship between the two main chars is the star of the movie. You\u000awill probably like this movie regardless of what age you are or your\u000atypical movie preference. Pretty awesome writing. This also shows that\u000ayou don't need to spend 200m to make a good quality film, just get a\u000agood story, good actors and good screen writing. There is a huge trend\u000ain Hollywood now that you gotta spend huge to get a good return, they\u000acan learn a lot from The ShawShank Redemption\u000a

V\u000aThis is simply one of the best movies I've seen in my whole life.

And once you've watched the movie\u000aonce, you will want to see it again and yet again, there is no point in\u000atime this movie will bore you.Its raw genius, from the actors and to the director - everybody did an\u000aexceptional job to give this movie true character. No movie will ever\u000asurpass this movie as the best movie of all times. From the plot, one can draw some conclusions about whats going to\u000ahappen, but that is irrelevant, to just follow through the story and to\u000abe able to enjoy whats being displayed is the greatest thing one can\u000ado.\u000a

V\u000aThis is an outstanding movie from beginning to end. The cast was picked\u000awith excellence and the characters were made so that the audience would\u000acare about them. Even though the middle of the story was a bit slow, it\u000abegan to drag when it started building up the plot for the climax in\u000athe middle. Stephen King does not usually write novels as a drama and\u000awhen he does do it, it is critically acclaimed. It is amazing how much\u000athough was put into making this story, with the back tracking to reveal\u000amajor plot points and how this happened. Morgan Freeman's narration is\u000aexcellent in this movie too, his character is one you won't forget\u000abecause of how strong his performance is. Over all this is a fantastic\u000amovie. If you haven't see this yet I recommend you do, this movie is\u000aone you won't want to forget.\u000a

V\u000aWhy do I want to write the 234th comment on The Shawshank Redemption? I\u000aam not sure - almost everything that could be possibly said about it\u000ahas been said. But like so many other people who wrote comments, I was\u000aand am profoundly moved by this simple and eloquent depiction of hope\u000aand friendship and redemption. The only other movie I have ever seen that effects me as strongly is To\u000aKill a Mockingbird. Both movies leave me feeling cleaner for having\u000awatched them.I didn't intend to see this movie at all: I do not like prison movies\u000aand I don't normally watch them. I work at a branch library and one day\u000aas I was checking The Shawshank Redemption out to one of our older\u000apatrons, she said to me, "Whenever I feel down or depressed, I check\u000aout this movie and watch it and it always makes me feel better." At the\u000atime, I thought that was very strange. One day there was nothing on TV\u000aexcept things I absolutely would not watch under any circumstance or\u000athings that I had seen too many times already. I remembered what she\u000asaid, so I watched it. I have watched it many many times since then and\u000ait gets better with every showing.No action, no special effects - just men in prison uniforms talking to\u000aeach other.The Shawshank Redemption and To Kill a Mockingbird are the best movies\u000aI have ever seen. I do not judge it by it's technical merits - I don't\u000areally care about that. I have read that Citizen Kane or The Godfather\u000aor this or that movie is the best movie ever made. They may have the\u000abest technique or be the most influential motion pictures ever made,\u000abut not the best. The best movies are ones that touch the soul. It\u000atakes a movie like The Shawshank Redemption to touch the soul.\u000a

V\u000aI have to say this gotta be one of the best movie of all time. I love\u000athe story the acting and the emotions, even the directing was great in\u000athis film. It's gonna be hard to have a movie like this complete again\u000abut it will i believe so. Morgan Freeman is so great even from this\u000amovie and everything else he has done throughout his career, i think\u000ait's his calmness that i like about the way he approaches his role in\u000athis and full of emotions inside. I feel like it's a story we can\u000arelate, how we are so used to something and then that's all we know\u000aabout and it's hard to change the habit and the way we look at things\u000aand also the struggle of life even most of it in this movie happens\u000ainside a prison. There's so many things i guess i can learn from this\u000amovie, so many messages that we can take and to realize that life is\u000apretty crazy and beautiful at the same time and we just gotta enjoy\u000aevery moment and every seconds we have living in this world. Cause\u000athere's so many people out there who's in a position that have done\u000asome wrong and got locked up in a prison and don't have any more\u000achances to change their mistakes and also opportunity to start fresh or\u000anew in life. We given chances in life and also free will to choose, so\u000aanyway i believe this movie changed my perception and also gave me\u000alessons to learn.\u000a

V\u000aCentral to the film's success is a riveting, unfussy performance from\u000aRobbins. Freeman has the showier role, allowing him a grace and dignity\u000athat come naturally. There are times when The Shawshank Redemption\u000acomes dangerously close to sounding one of those "triumph of the\u000aspirit" notes. But most of it is eloquently restrained. As the uptight\u000abanker, Robbins does some of his subtlest acting to date. As his\u000ahardened but resilient friend, Freeman is simply miraculous, giving the\u000arole so much depth, dignity, and good humor that you feel that you've\u000aknown this man forever. If the film is perhaps a little slow in its\u000amiddle passages, maybe that is part of the idea, too, to give us a\u000asense of the leaden passage of time, before the glory of the final\u000aredemption. Some of "The Shawshank Redemption'' comes across as\u000aoutrageously improbable. Yet the film keeps pulling you back with its\u000asense of striving humanity slowly turning the tables against evil.\u000a

V\u000aThis is truly one of the best movies ever made! Stephen King is an\u000aamazing writer and this movie reflects his abilities to a T. I cannot\u000apick a favorite between this and The Green Mile. It could not have\u000abetter done!!! The movie was perfectly casted. All of the actors were\u000asuperb in their acting. It followed the book rather well, with very few\u000achanges made. If you love Stephen King, you will love this movie. I\u000alove Andy and Red's relationship the most. And it had a perfect ending.\u000aI have told everyone I know to watch this movie at least once, just for\u000athe experience. Everyone I have told to watch it has thanked me for\u000atelling them to, saying they too loved this movie. Even my children\u000alove this movie and will sit through its entirety without complaint.\u000aAbsolutely a 10 out of 10!!!!\u000a

I'm saying this,\u000abecause what you are getting here, is very close to adult films.\u000aSomething people in Germany (censors that is), do not have a problem\u000awith (the movie is rated 16+).I can only guess the movie will be NC-17 (if they rate it) in America.\u000aThere are explicit images of male genitalia, a lot bare breasts (though\u000amostly of our main female lead). With all that said, I went into the\u000amovie with the impression I wouldn't like it at all.\u000a

V\u000aFor someone who always thinks they are being wrongly accused of\u000asomething, this movie is the ultimate journey of one man's redemption\u000aand triumph over his past. Tim Robbins, Morgan Freeman, and the entire\u000acast are flawless in their performances and this movie hits the head\u000aright on the nose with the social justice politics and policies of the\u000atime period that the movie appeared in. I highly recommend this film to\u000aanyone who loves a good "man vs. nature" story. One of my favorite\u000ascenes is when Timothy plays the opera music in the office. The Italian\u000aarias that the two women sing are incredibly beautiful and speak to the\u000acaged bird that he has become who wants to break free and soar past his\u000acircumstances\u000a

V\u000aA good prison movie whose cult of fans has made it into something so\u000amuch more than it is. Greatest movie ever made? Get real. It's not even\u000athe greatest prison movie ever made. Hell, it's not even the best movie\u000areleased in 1994! It's predictable and borrows heavily from decades of\u000aprison movie clichés. It's also nowhere near as deep as its staunchest\u000aadmirers would have you believe. Still, it's an entertaining movie.\u000aNice direction from Frank Darabont. Morgan Freeman is the highlight\u000awith a solid supporting cast. Tim Robbins, however, is borderline\u000aridiculous at times with his cartoonish facial expressions and silly\u000a"stares-off-into-the-distance" moments. He's so far beneath Freeman as\u000aan actor it's sad. With a normal movie like this, I would focus more on\u000athe positives. I did give it a 7, after all. Unfortunately, it is\u000aeasily the most overrated movie of all time (on IMDb, for sure) and as\u000asuch the balance of positive to negative is out of whack.\u000a

It is not on par with godfather 1 and godfather 2 and also there\u000ais Schindler's list. the villain could be better. If this is what\u000asomeone says about Shawshank redemption, do not fall for it. And it's\u000aall about perspective. It has a powerful message waiting for you to\u000arecognize.

V\u000aThis movie is based on the resilience of a guy whom had the chance to\u000abe all along his detention in the same cell, near the outer wall of the\u000aprison. Then, of course, no one thought that a wall made of mud, which\u000aconveniently doesn't make a sound when dug, wouldn't be sufficient to\u000aprevent a detainee, who has nothing else to do, to dig it in to get\u000aout.The rest of the movie is stepping up to be the masterpiece we all know\u000aand love.

V\u000aThis movie is based on a novella by Stephen King, but don't let that\u000aput you off. It's not a horror film, rather a thumping good ode to\u000afriendship, hope, wit, wiles and wisdom, brimming with crackling\u000acharacters and topped with the most twister of twists since The Crying\u000aGame. Found guilty of killing his unfaithful wife and her lover in a\u000afit of passion, sullen accountant Andy Dufresne (Robbins, casting off\u000ahis goof ball image to display more layers than the proverbial onion)\u000ais shipped to the Gothic wind-swept corridors of the Shawshank State\u000aPrison for life. It is here the movie gracefully unfolds.

V\u000aI'm not giving a low rating because I'm against whats popular.\u000aShawshank Redemption is a great film, its actually one my favorites.\u000aThe characters are portrayed very well, except for Andy. I know he is\u000asupposed to be an emotionless socially awkward guy who only has one\u000afacial expression. In that case he played his role perfectly but I\u000adon't think its a wise choice to have a... main? Character like that?\u000aI'm not sure if Red was the main character, he is our eyes and ears\u000aso...Either way the film shows cinematic genius and truly amazing story\u000atelling. I enjoyed every second of it, some say certain areas of the\u000astory dragged on too long but hey its prison. Every moment in prison is\u000adragged along. But I don't know about being the greatest film on IMDb.\u000aI would say Citizen Kane should be number 1. Citizen Kane is so amazing\u000aits actually art. So again loved Shawshank Redemption and I wish more\u000amovies were like it, but I don't know about greatest film of all time.\u000a

V\u000aIt has long been my contention that it is the movie-maker's task to\u000ahold the viewer's attention, not to burden him with his self-indulgent,\u000adifficult-to-follow symbolisms. That having been said, I find it\u000adifficult to find another movie I would recommend more highly than The\u000aShawshank Redemption. Without any high- adrenaline action sequences or\u000asteamy sex scenes (two sure-fire ways to get the viewer's attention),\u000athis film somehow has the power to make you sit through all 142 minutes\u000awithout for a moment getting bored. And I challenge anyone who has seen\u000ait to delete any scene, even any minute, from the final edit. The fact\u000ais, you can't. Because every single scene is an essential element that\u000acontributes to the final result: a masterpiece that captures the drama\u000aof enduring friendship and resiliency of the human spirit more\u000apowerfully than any other film ever made. Even those who normally do\u000anot watch movies with a critical eye will find themselves so drawn into\u000athis experience. I really can't say enough about this film. Suffice it\u000ato say that this is certainly the Greatest Movie Not to Win an Oscar.\u000a(Since Citizen Kane, at least. )Actually, I can forgive the Film Academy for not honoring this film\u000awith the Oscars I firmly believe it deserved. But when the American\u000aFilm Institute in 1998 put together their list of The 100 Greatest\u000aMovies of all time (covering the period from 1896-1996), and so\u000amyopically overlooked Shawshank in favor of such titles as Rocky, Dr.\u000aStrangelove, Network, and Jaws, well, I thought that was absolutely\u000aridiculous.I wouldn't hesitate to put it in the top five of all time.\u000a

V\u000aI cannot believe that it took me 17 years to see this movie and was it\u000aworth the wait well here's what the film is about.The story is about a young banker played by Tim Robbins who was\u000aconvicted of murdering his wife and her lover and is sentenced to life\u000ain Shawnshank prison where he meets a former crook named Reed played by\u000athe brilliant actor of our generation Morgan Freeman. The two become\u000ainseparable as they deal with prison life and the guards betting the\u000aHELL out of some of the prisoners; one got killed to death by the guard\u000awhile the other hanged himself to death.Everyday they have to dig up\u000aholes and eating disgusting food, but will Andy(aka Robbins)ever get\u000aout of prison and did he really kill his wife and her lover in\u000acold-blood?Bottom line is this; I'm 22 years of age a female who hates watching\u000athese kind of movies as there really not my cup of tea,I'm sort of a\u000aromantic/fantasy/cartoon/drama/weepie kind of chick and I hate watching\u000aviolent movies,but this movie was really good;but seriously is it the\u000abest movie in the world? well for me its not in fact its all about\u000adealing with prison life and the whole motto is get busy or die trying. Overall I did enjoy this movie but I wouldn't be watching it again.\u000aOnce is enough for me.SO I'm giving it a 7.5/10\u000a

V\u000aIn my opinion this movie is far from the greatest movie of all time.\u000aThou, it's a thrilling story, includes great acting and visually\u000aconstitutes of some extraordinary cinematography. The overall\u000aimpression you're left with after watching the shawshank redemption\u000adoes not make a lasting one. I don't know if it's the relatively dull\u000aundertone or the mainstreamness of its story style, which makes it a\u000arather ordinary movie experience. I believe the Godfather was a better\u000achoice for the number one spot, however there are a lot of other great\u000aones out there. I don't regret watching this movie, it's well worth its 2,5 hours and I\u000arecommend you to watch it for the movie classic it is. But I wont\u000abother to see it again.\u000a

V\u000aNever has perseverance played such a strong character on film. The\u000arespect and friendship that came from it were against all odds, but to\u000ado so one would need hope. Tim Robbins' Andy Dufresne manages that\u000aintangible saving grace over decades while falsely imprisoned and it's\u000aMorgan Freemans' Red who narrates for us and in constant perspective\u000aagainst the institutionalization of the Maine State penitentiary. The\u000asymbiotic relationship between the two is perfect cinema chemistry. The\u000aending is quite fantasy, but makes for good afternoon drama on TNT who,\u000aI believe bought the rights for a cheep price, and that's a happy\u000aending for Ted Turner!\u000a

V\u000aIt's a good movie. I love this film. It's a story about hope and dreams\u000aand one whose emotional impact is as great as the Pacific Ocean is\u000ablue. An amazing movie. Easily one of the best movies made during the\u000a90s and definitely one of the top 'prison' movies of all-time. Pretty\u000amuch everything about this movie works and works extremely well! I have\u000anot read Stephen King's novella (his first non-horror), but some of the\u000amovie's deficiencies, such as the old-fashioned morality tale and\u000aportentous message about camaraderie and redemption--must have been in\u000athe source material. Darabont explores the range of human kindness and\u000acruelty as he lovingly and patiently sculpts his large cast of\u000acharacters against magnificent scenery.\u000a

V\u000aI would recommend this film. It has a good plot and in the end all the\u000asmall things you never noticed all add up. So overall it's a good film.\u000aIt has a good meaning to it which a lot of films nowadays lack. However\u000aduring the first hour of the film I found it quite boring. It was as if\u000athe film was leading to something and although things happened it just\u000adidn't interest as me as much. In saying that the film really does have\u000aa good meaning which is why I like it so much.Although I would recommend this film there are other films which have a\u000asimilar meaning which I personally think are better.I gave it 7 out of 10 simply because this film is above the average\u000afilm but it's not exceptional.\u000a

V\u000aThe movies is very good and near spellbinding. I have seen it more than\u000aonce. Every time I see it playing on TV, I still watch it. The plot,\u000athe acting, the dialog are very good. You do tend to lose yourself at\u000atimes. The plot is also unusual. It also has some my favorite lines. But, I am really surprised to see Shawsank Redemption at the top. I\u000aguess, most people look for entertainment value and overlook things\u000athat are not very possible. The movie tends to be a bit unrealistic for\u000acertain events. They could have made it more realistic, since\u000aeverything else was done to perfection.Should you watch it? Absolutely.Should you give it a 9/10 rating? I am not so sure.\u000a

V\u000aOkay, if you seen this film because it was the number one top user\u000arated film on IMDb, you are along with pretty much everybody else\u000aincluding me. This is still a rich film with a great ending and just\u000asomething that leaves the audience over all happy at the end. The only\u000amajor issue is how incredibly over-rated this film is, that since its\u000agot to that status people start to hate it due to his incredibly\u000ainflated ratings. Which is sad, because its a great film, nothing\u000asensationally magical about it, just a solid film that did what it was\u000atrying to do. Everything was a little above average on this film, but\u000anothing really stood out to you and made you say 'wow this is\u000abrilliant.' It's no a masterpiece by any means just a film that should\u000abe respected but in it's entirety nothing more.I watched this film hoping that since it was number one it would live\u000aup to that spot and it fell short for me, but it may just me, and my\u000astyle of movies. However, I don't really think anybody will hate this\u000afilm, but I don't think it deserve to be where it is, there are plenty\u000aof other films I would choose as 'better' over this one. Over all it's still a great flick that everybody should ultimately\u000aenjoy, but to claim its the best film ever made? Is quite simply\u000aentirely untrue. score:7.5 to 8\u000a

V\u000aFirstly, as you probably know, this film is great! There's no two ways\u000aabout it, this film is great and always will be for many decades to\u000acome.The casting is perfect and the performances of Tim Robbins and Morgan\u000aFreeman are just brilliant. The film also has a message which all\u000aviewers will relate to in one way or another and the last half an hour\u000ais probably the best period in the film.However, the plot of Shawshank is entirely predictable and the movie is\u000away too long with periods where absolutely nothing is happening.All in all, Shawshank Redemption is a great film, if not the best of\u000athe last century. It has many things going for a bit but is let down by\u000aa few dull scenes and a predictable story line.\u000a

V\u000aBeginning as a story about a man named Andy, who is sentenced two life\u000asentences for killing his cheating wife and the man with her. Except he\u000adidn't do it. Beginning as a simple story, it develops. And slowly but\u000asurely, it rises and builds. He meet's Red, a inmate in the prison. He\u000abuilds a library, a prison and a friendship. And he loves getting beer.\u000aEven with out suspense, it's kind-of suspenseful. The ending is very\u000asatisfying. It is not a okay movie. It is a great film. One of the\u000abest. 8 out of 10. A fine rating for me. As good as King's story. If\u000ayou have not seen it, give it a try. It deserves it's high rating. In\u000amy top ten films. As it is known as a masterpiece, I have to say, it\u000ais. And as it has trolls, I have to say, they are so wrong.\u000a

V\u000aEssentially, The Shawshank Redemption is about the survival of the\u000ahuman spirit---in a colossally adverse situation. The brutality and\u000acorruption which goes on in Shawshank Prison...never hits the viewer\u000aright between the eyes (like it should). Thats due to the calming tones\u000aof our narrator...Morgan Freeman. Mans in-humanity to man....is on full\u000adisplay here...and its this strange mix of violence, upright stoicism\u000aand high morality that makes for a heady brew. Lets not under-rate the\u000anarration of Morgan Freeman---this was a huge reason why this movie is\u000anow considered to be...a Classic. So, why did it bomb when it was\u000areleased ? Maybe it needs a couple of viewings for all the gears to\u000amesh (Who knows?) My major criticism , is that i thought the two leads\u000aneeded to be a bit more edgy , a little bit more angry. After all\u000a..they weren't Saints. However, the messages that most people take from\u000athis movie are positive (me included). I do not think its a\u000aClassic------but it sure is a powerful movie ... and a very good one.\u000a

V\u000aHaving not read the book initially, this movie blew me away. With such\u000aintricacy to detail and screenplay which kept the viewer gripped The\u000aShawshank Redemption was one movie which ranks as most appealing to me.The whole time I, as a viewer, did not expect that the ending was going\u000ato be like that, to that extent. The acting was indeed superb and the\u000away of expressing the changes in character and settings was impeccable.To reiterate to an audience what was occurring inside of the jail, and\u000ato depict changes in emotions and feeling with such clarity definitely\u000ajustifies that the director of this movie was more than the average one\u000ain Hollywood.1994, 18 years ago, was when this movie was made but to the level to\u000awhich it takes one is truly outstanding. One is absorbed by it, and\u000athere is no confusion about what is happening but rather thoughts in\u000athe viewers' minds about "What is gonna happen next?" These thoughts\u000aare present when watching a horror/ thriller movie for the most part,\u000abut for aficionados of different genres to all like this movie proves\u000athat this was one heck of a movie.Cannot miss this movie; it is one that makes one think, learn, and be\u000aentertained simultaneously.\u000a

V\u000aTwo imprisoned men bond over a number of years, finding solace and\u000aeventual redemption through acts of common decency.With The Shawshank Redemption number 1 on the top 250, you can easily\u000asay that I had huge expectations. I never thought of it as the best\u000amovie ever, but I still thought it would a great, moving experience\u000athat gradually deserved it's position. If your expecting just that; I\u000asuggest to throw your expectations away and keep away. HONESTLY, I\u000afound the film to be quite good but the movie is obviously overrated.\u000aFirst up, the acting and directing was fantastic. The first, say, 30\u000aminutes had drawn me in fantastically. Unforgivably, this is the point\u000awhere the movie dragged itself down and made me lose interest a couple\u000atimes. Again, this is no way means I hated the film; I found it to be\u000agreat, but the fact that this film is top (especially over The\u000aGodfather) confuses me. Honestly, the final minutes failed to move me;\u000awhich I expected. But although I found the movie to be good, I don't\u000afind it to be one of the best. In fact, I might forget about it soon\u000adown the road. So if your like me, and had all these expectations for a\u000agreat film, and was sadly letdown by a poor interest-level, stay away.\u000aI know I'm probably going to get a lot of heat for this post, but I'm\u000astating my opinion. Maybe I was too tired to understand the impact or\u000amaybe I wasn't in the mood for this kind of film. MAYBE, one day, I'll\u000ahave the time to re-watch and reconsider my opinion. Nonetheless, I\u000awasn't too impressed. The movie is great but lacks your interest. I\u000agets 7/10 for it's premise and 5/10 for it's overrated score. I would\u000arecommend (possibly) if your into prison movies and maybe not so much\u000aif you relate to me. 5/10.\u000a

V\u000aAt the beginning when you watch the movie you will see the film was an\u000aordinary and doesn't deserves to be the best film in cinema history,\u000abut don't be fooled by the title of the book because you don't know the\u000acontent is real only when you deepening it,, because the viewer\u000abreathtaking start the story epic and heroic "people say that old\u000amovies the best of the modern I agree with that as soon as I watched\u000athis film, but i don't always agree that it is impossible to logically\u000a"..I was surprised in the past before I watch the film to see what all\u000aof these popular about so? ... I have started gradually discovered that\u000awhen I saw a lot of details about the main story ..I raised my\u000aadmiration for the story associated with some double by (andy) and that\u000athe new person who came recently to the prison, which is called (Tommy)\u000awho told the story to (Andy) about the real killer of his wife and her\u000alover .. So it was a story I didn't hear the strangest of them before.\u000aI must say that this scene is the strangest sight I have ever seen.\u000aThis is true art, to begin to describe this film as a story of hope I\u000ahave some words about hope, I like to write to you, which I doubt\u000areally that it will consolidate in the mind of the reader when they\u000ahear or read (do not give up that stalled your feet and fell into a\u000alarge hole claims the prison will come out of them and you are more\u000acoherent and strength to that, whatever the difficulties of life they\u000aare experiencing and if the problems and your weight on your shoulders\u000aand if you really want to change, if you want to transform your life\u000afor the better, you must demonstrate hope, whatever the circumstances\u000athat prevailed in that bright future is linked with hope!) If you are a\u000afan of crime stories and movies that relate to imprisonment and escape\u000afrom it in a way you never heard before , which will satisfy your\u000adesire when you see the film because it contains a lot of meanings\u000apowerful and sincere feelings for those looking for hope and\u000aredemption. But not in the knowledge that this film does not hold\u000aAction or any of that because everything is owned by the effects of\u000aspiritual and words from the heart and the deep connotations.\u000a

V\u000aI, like most of the people I have known in the past thirty years or so\u000athat discuss movies find that some stick out as gems. This is not one.\u000aSince this movie came out, no one of dozens of people that are my\u000afriends have described it as the best movie ever. In terms of its rank\u000aon IMDb, is TSR overrated? YES! I went to about twenty other movie\u000asites before I stopped looking and only found it on only one site\u000awithin the top twenty. Just try it yourself. You won't even find it in\u000athe top fifty on most. Better than "The Godfather", no. Better than\u000a"Citizen Kane", maybe - (another overrated movie). Se7en is a more\u000aengaging movie in terms of relationships between people. Shawshank\u000aRedemption is like a vanilla R rated Disney movie, but enjoyable\u000anonetheless. I don't dislike the movie. I just do not understand the\u000acomplex and secret algorithms that IMDb uses. On some pages IMDb claims\u000ato explain its vote calculation methods to you and on others it says\u000athat it will never disclose its method of calculation completely. Maybe\u000athey have a system that works but is not perfect. It certainly does not\u000acoincide with the number of people that have seen a particular movie.\u000aMaybe the compensation for the fact that far fewer people have seen TSR\u000athan The Godfather is a factor.\u000a

V\u000aWow, been a few years. I'm editing my old post. I'd like to humbly\u000athank everyone here for rating my flick so highly. #1, huh? Providing\u000athe story for Shawshank Redemption was an imagination of myself under\u000athe short story's circumstances. It is similar to K-PAX that way and of\u000athe same vintage. Having been a business major at Georgia Tech, it\u000awould be natural for me to help with estate planning, taxes, and\u000aaccounting had I been taken prisoner. The inside out program of public\u000aworks and attendant graft, corruption, intimidation and murder was my\u000away of encouraging scrutiny of similar programs nation-wide. I had been\u000aPostmaster of the Georgia State Senate at 21, so that is why the State\u000aSenate was written instead of the more common oracles, say the Maine\u000aGovernor's office or other organs of government and foundations. The\u000aMozart duet wasn't of my choosing, but it's generally acknowledged as\u000aamong the most beautiful pieces of music ever written, so that choice\u000awas a no-brainer. I would have preferred the flute solo from Orpheus,\u000abut that's just me. I purposefully decided against another loathsome\u000aportrayal of racial casts that were very common at that time, so as not\u000ato 'date' the picture and to influence viewers toward tolerance even in\u000aintolerable circumstances. Against opposition, I gave the important Red\u000acharacter to an African-American actor. (In the short story Red had\u000abeen an Irishman.) At the time, that dimmed prospects for box office\u000asuccess, but given that the flick is now well- received, emulation has\u000aled to further improvement. When we did this one in 1988ish, in\u000aSyracuse, New York, I was attending graduate school of medicine at\u000aSUNY-upstate and working in Max Mozell's lab. At about the same time, I\u000adid dozens of films and won many Oscars for the various ghost writers.\u000a(Gladiator, Good Will Hunting, Cast Away, Mystic River, Eternal\u000aSunshine of the Spotless Mind, Enemy at the Gates, Green Mile,\u000aShawshank Redemption, Vanilla Sky, A Beautiful Mind, Forrest Gump, The\u000aMatrix films, The Bourne films, National Treasure films, Pirates of the\u000aCaribbean films, Avatar, Titanic, Lost in Translation, UP, ). The name\u000aof the Mexican town on the seashore was conveyed to me by my old\u000afriend, Frank Arnold, who was Zawataneo (sp?) on vacation while in\u000amedical school. He spelled it for me over the phone while the 'creative\u000ateam' and I worked out the flick's details. Since then, the town has\u000aboomed, an unexpected gift to Mexico. I set this one in Maine, to\u000ade-stigmatize inflexible regional prejudices then current. It seems to\u000ahave worked. Michael Meyers figured me out, this flick is part of the\u000aseries designed to change the world, save the planet, and bring the\u000ahuman race closer to God Almighty.\u000a

V\u000aI must start by stating that I have watched the movie at least 20\u000atimes. This is a masterpiece , work of a genius . And I recommend\u000aeveryone to watch this movie at least once in their lifetime .But .. yes there are some buts, when you get over the initial amazement\u000athis movie brings to you you will find out that the plot was not very\u000asolid. There are lots of very big loopholes (potholes ?? ) in the plot.\u000aLike how weird is it that the prisoner is in the same cell for 20 years\u000a.Or, he did not have another cell on his right, or he knew there will\u000abe thunderstorm on the right he decided to flee. I personally felt very\u000abad after I realized these very very weak links in the movie which\u000aactually weakens the foundation of the whole movie. It's like after\u000aworshiping a person for 20 years of your life you come to know some\u000athing really bad about him .At one point of time I used to very strongly vote that if any movie\u000adeserve to be the number 1 on IMDb, it's this movie. I am not so\u000aconvinced anymore .\u000a

We are shown flashbacks to the events leading\u000aup to their slaying, but not enough for us to convict Andy along with\u000athe judge and this makes for an intriguing character watching the movie\u000afor the first time 'round. Inside the walls of Shawshank, Andy still\u000aclaims his innocence, only to find he isn't alone. But it isn't long\u000abefore he approaches go-to-guy Ellis 'Red' Redding for a rock hammer\u000aand Rita Hayworth poster, eventually becoming best buddies with him.The theme of the piece is freedom and what it means to the men inside.\u000aThe elderly 'Brooks' Hatlen is what Darabont calls "the spine of the\u000astory", who walks the straight and narrow path upon his release from\u000aprison but whose institutionalisation holds him back from enjoying free\u000alife and participating in the outside world. Red is also "an\u000ainstitutional man" whose constant rejections from the parole board have\u000aled him to believe that hope is a bad thing. Whereas seemingly infinite\u000aoasis of hope Andy, who after being raped constantly by 'the Sisters'\u000aand being sent way down in the hole a buncha times, still maintains his\u000aspirit. "Salvation lies within", as the Warden says.However, there is also a physical journey Brooks, Red and Andy take.\u000aPrison represents Hell in this very symbolically Christian story, the\u000ahalfway-house Brooks and Red go through, Purgatory, and Zihuatanejo,\u000athe "warm place with no memory" is of course, Heaven. Andy is even\u000abaptised after escaping the walls of the prison when he falls out of\u000athe sewage pipe into the water of the crick in the pouring rain. The\u000amost seemingly Christian man in the movie, Warden, is actually the\u000aDevil with sadistic Captain Hadley as his Beelzebub. Writer and director Frank Darabont uses posters of sex symbols Rita\u000aHayworth, Marilyn Monroe and Raquel Welch to mark the passage of time\u000aAndy serves (just under twenty years) inside, while Andy uses them to\u000acover up his escape route. 'The Shawshank Redemption' may appear to be\u000ain colour at first, but it is very much a black-and-white old-school\u000aCapra story, with modern blood, profanity and references to sodomy. Bad\u000aguys are bad guys and good guys are good guys. The Hollywood way is a\u000atimeless thing. People climb out of sewers without a trace of turd on\u000athem and show no visible signs of ageing in twenty years.The movie has the same values of Capra, whom Darabont acknowledges as a\u000amajor influence, and that isn't a bad thing when you stand it up\u000aagainst the largely nihilistic or simply stylistic movies of it's era,\u000aergo all of QT's work, Scorsese's gangster pictures of that decade etc.\u000aThe American film industry of the time's fondness for the downer\u000aending, or lack of one was probably what drove the public out to the\u000arental stores in the mid-nineties in search of this after the perhaps\u000aoff-puttingly schmaltzy Gumpfest of this movie's year in the cinema\u000afailed to relate to many on a human level. 'Shawshank' has the necessary grit and real-life situations for a\u000amodern audience to get into it, but it also tells them what to think\u000aand feel with it's near constant narration and score like a movie from\u000athe forties might have. This is perhaps why it is such a firm favourite\u000aof the casual viewer, as it carries them along rather than allowing\u000athem to figure anything out or decide on their own ending. What the\u000aenormous popularity of the picture proves is that viewers would rather\u000anot be challenged but rather placated.\u000a

V\u000aThis is one of my favorite movies, but it does just go to show the\u000aimportance of a great script, good casting and good direction. By that\u000aI mean that, for example, in this movie, the Tim Robbins character\u000alooks like someone who's admirable in every way in the world. But in\u000areal life, I saw Tim Robbins on some TV show where he was interviewed,\u000aand he came across as about as smart as a doorknob. I rate the movie an\u000a8 and rate Tim Robbins a 5. What a jackass. Morgan Freeman is topnotch\u000aas always, and so is James Whitmore. Real professionals. So is Bob\u000aGunton, the warden. To Tim Robbins credit, this was one of the best\u000ajobs he ever did, and maybe the very best. Also an unusually good job\u000afor Stephen King, who, in this flick, took a break from his usual\u000amoronic horror stories.\u000a

V\u000aWhat would you do if you were convicted of murdering your wife and her\u000alover, and sentenced to two life-imprisonment terms? Would you just\u000agive up? Would you try to escape? How long would you have to live in\u000aprison before you lose hope? Writer-Director Frank Darabont (The Mist,\u000aThe Green Mile) explores these situations, and the themes of integrity,\u000ahope, and freedom.Tim Robbins portrays the character of Andy Dufresne, the man who's\u000asituation was described earlier. Andy claims he didn't commit the\u000amurders, but strong evidence overruled his claims. Did Andy really not\u000ado it? We never really know for sure until later on in the film. When\u000aAndy first arrives at Shawshank prison, he's antisocial, and goes along\u000awith the prison's routine for months. After a few months, however, Andy\u000astarts developing a friendship with Red (Morgan Freeman), a man who can\u000aget practically anything from outside the prison to inside, for a\u000aprice. Andy asks him for a rock hammer. The importance of this rock\u000ahammer is evident later on in the film. But Andy's request for this\u000arock hammer at the beginning of the film allows him to make a new\u000afriend at the prison to keep him company.Andy's time at Shawshank prison causes it to change dramatically.\u000aWithin a few years, Andy becomes an important aspect to the prison. His\u000aaccounting skills help him receive benefits for himself and his friends\u000aby helping the prison guards with their taxes and other financial\u000aissues. The warden of Shawshank prison also takes interest in Andy, and\u000asoon uses him for a complex money scheme. Andy's role in the prison\u000aallows him to have a library established in the prison, as well as get\u000abeers and other things for his friends. Andy is basically making a new\u000alife for himself in the prison, but he still wants to get out. However,\u000ahow many years does it take in the prison for him to give up? How many\u000ayears does it take until the prison is your only way of life? This\u000abecomes a problem for many prison inmates, and even to a friend of\u000aAndy's.One of the prisoners, Brookes (James Whitmore) is in this predicament.\u000aBrookes has lived in the prison for so long, for many decades, that\u000ait's all he knows. In the film Brookes gets released out of Shawshank\u000aprison, and is allowed to live a normal life; he has a job and a home.\u000aHowever, how does one live in a world that has drastically changed over\u000athe past decades? When Brookes was a little boy, cars were rare, but\u000awhen he gets released from prison cars were everywhere. It's difficult\u000ato cope with, and Brookes is unable to deal with it. How long until\u000aAndy is the same way?The film portrays two decades of Andy's sentence, with many different\u000ainteresting story lines and conflicts mixed in, with many different\u000acharacters. 'The Shawshank Redemption' has one important plot involving\u000aAndy's life in the prison and his hopes to escape, along with numerous\u000aside plots involving new inmates and such. The third act of the film is\u000athe quickest, and one of the most interesting parts. It involves a\u000astrong, yet completely unpredictable, resolution to the film. It also\u000awraps up the lives of the main characters within the film in satisfying\u000aways.'The Shawshank Redemption' does an excellent job at portraying the\u000athemes of integrity and freedom, and how the prison can sometimes be\u000asome peoples' freedom, with the outside world being feared. Andy's\u000aintegrity and hopes to escape from the prison is also a major part of\u000athe film. 'The Shawshank Redemption', adapted from the Stephen King\u000anovel, 'Rita Hayworth and Shawshank Redemption', is a strongly-acted,\u000awell-written, and wonderfully-directed film. It's an amazing and\u000ainspirational piece of work, and probably the most perfect film I've\u000aever seen. The plot is always at the same constant pace, and is never\u000aslowed down and boring. Every single part of the film is strong,\u000aentertaining, and thoughtful. It truly is a perfect film (this doesn't\u000anecessarily mean it's the the best film ever in the history of cinema).PS: 'The Shawshank Redemption' came out around the same time as\u000a'Forrest Gump' (1994). Both films are amazing and one of the best, but\u000a'Shawshank' was overshadowed by the popularity of 'Gump.' But years\u000alater, 'Shawshank Redemption' was placed even higher than 'Forrest\u000aGump' on AFI's 100 Years 100 Movies list. 'Shawshank' is also\u000acurrently the #1 movie of all time on IMDb. Go figure.\u000a

V\u000aThis movie is a heart felt classic. One of the best of all time. And\u000athats because it's one of the best story's of all time, combined with a\u000agreat plot, great acting, and great script. Quotable, emotional, and\u000aall about redeeming one's life.It contains great tragedy with great camaraderie. The villain, who is\u000athe warden at the Prison, may be one of the most well developed\u000avillains ever. You see his weakness and his strength. You see the same\u000aqualities in yourself in the mistakes you made. And when he collapses\u000aat the end, you hate and pity him at the same time. Andy, the lead\u000acharacter, is perhaps the greatest heroin. He doesn't possess special\u000apowers to make him great. He possesses the best of human nature. He's\u000atough, enduring, passionate, smart, and pure of heart.Had to review this movie when I saw the Godfather creeping up on it in\u000athe IMDb top 250. Godfather is not the same caliber. Anyone can\u000aappreciate this movie. There are plenty of people who would feel 'Out\u000aof Touch' with The Godfather, but they arn't reviewing it.\u000a

V\u000aReally Fantastic,Nicely presented movie.Many positives only.No\u000anegatives No regular features.Immeterial of the place and\u000asituation,what a difference a person's(Andy's) attitude & initiatives\u000acan bring for himself and his friend RED who is a hopeless person.The\u000aWarden considered a worthy good person in the jail premises suppose to\u000amonitor all.He is good only in the eyes of the public and Law,but\u000apractically not so.The Director and the people who voted positive needs\u000ato be appreciated for their bold initiative of supporting such a low\u000abudgeted movie with emphasis on reality.Watching this movie by any\u000aperson and in any situation can bring happiness to him/her and the\u000apeople around.\u000a

V\u000aSo as the summary of my post shows, I just registered on IMDb. Never\u000areally cared about writing reviews or rating movies before. But then a\u000afew days ago this movie was on TV. So I watched it, there wasn't\u000aanything with big explosions on any other channel, so I thought why\u000anot. This was before I've even heard of it. Now I know it's #1 on IMDb,\u000abut I didn't have any idea what it was even about when it was on.Anyway, after about 15 minutes I knew there would be something special\u000aabout this movie, and boy was I right. I might not be the most\u000aarticulate review-writer, as I've seen allot of good reviews on IMDb.\u000aBut I still want to write something more than "IT'S FRICKI' AMAZING!".\u000aBut I just don't know where to start. There are so many characters and\u000astories, and the depth of it all is just unbelievable. At the end of it\u000aI was just sitting there glaring at the screen, smiling to myself for\u000awitnessing such a masterpiece. So I guess I'll have to settle with\u000aoption 1. It's just simply amazing. Watch it. It's not overrated. That\u000ais all.\u000a

V\u000aThis movie is THE classic. It is a beautiful, well thought, captivating\u000adrama that really touches you. It is no surprise that's the number 1 by\u000amany reviewers and ultimately #1 in the IMDb Top 250.The plot is rather simple : a man is accused for committing a crime\u000awhich he did not take part in. That being said , the movie tells his\u000alife in the prison , thorough the eyes of another character, Red,\u000aportrayed by Morgan Freeman..One can ask how this basic, modest story , can be so astonishing.One of the things that contribute to this magic title , is the rather\u000ahumble , very human way that the main character acts . Although\u000ainjusticed, he manages to keep his head cool , and makes everything he\u000acan to aid his and their fellas life better , with the help of\u000aelementary things like a cigarette , a beer or even a book.The story is told with a perfect and quiet pace, guided by the words of\u000aFreeman - they transmit a sense of understanding, calming and wisdom\u000asense that follows through until the very end of the movie.In result, the Shawhank Redemption is the perfect ride - delivers\u000aeverything one could want and yet arises meaningfully questions\u000aconcerning the purpose and ways of life , that one should not just\u000aignore.\u000a

V\u000aWihthout a doubt this is one of my all time favorite movies and is\u000aprobably the best Stephen King film.I had never heard of it until i saw\u000athe IMDb top 250.Better than The Godfather.I'm super glad this is #1 on\u000athe top 250.It has an amazing plot and is a movie that sends a lot of\u000amessages one being that institutionalization has a huge effect on\u000apeople that are in prison for many years and they get used to it.When\u000athey leave they want to go back to the prison as it is their home. It\u000ais a shame it didn't win any awards at the Academy Awards.If I were on\u000athe panel deciding what movie should win Best Picture Oscar I would\u000ahave picked The Shawshank Redemption which would have been a hard task\u000aas 2 other masterpieces Forrest Gump and Pulp Fiction were also in the\u000anominees.1994 must have been a really outstanding year in film.I wish I\u000acould give it 11 stars.This is a movie you have to see.It truly is a\u000afilm that is for watching dozens of times and is a beauty all the time10/10\u000a

V\u000aThe Shawshank Redemption may be one of the best movies that I have ever\u000aseen. The acting is excellent with a stunning story provided by my\u000afavorite author, Stephen King, the movie had to be great. The Shawshank\u000aRedemption is original, dark, and mysterious. It keeps you guessing\u000athrough to the end. Having read some of Stephen King's work, I normally\u000awould enjoy the book more than the story because the movie has to be\u000achanged to fit MPAA criteria. This movie was just like the story and\u000athat is why it is so great. Tim Robbins makes a great lead character\u000abut what makes him even better is that he has got Morgan Freeman along\u000aside of him as his buddy. Overall, I would recommend this movie to\u000aeveryone. It doesn't even matter what kind of movies they like.\u000a

V\u000aThis movie was clearly the best movie I've ever seen. I watched it\u000abecause it was number 1 on IMDb. Turns out my favorite movies like the\u000areturn of the king, Forrest Gump, or the dark night didn't even come\u000aclose to it. Why can't movie directors now days make such a good movie\u000alike this anymore? I would definitely recommend people to watch this if\u000ayou like serious movies or meaningful movies. But if your the type of\u000aperson who has ADHD and can't stand watching a talking scene for 10\u000aseconds, i wouldn't recommend this to you. I would warn you that this\u000ais a long movie and it's not meant to watch it in birthday parties\u000aunless if your friends are all nerds or serious people. Also don't let\u000ayour parents see it because there are many swear words in it, with some\u000aviolence and almost a gay sex-scene. Other wise this movie is\u000agreat!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!\u000a

V\u000aDon't get me wrong,I loved this movie. It's a beautiful and powerful\u000afictional story, beautifully and powerfully told. Incredible job by\u000aeveryone involved,and this is a very rich movie,it goes everywhere and\u000anever misses,and the control and confidence with which it is driven\u000aforward by Darabont reminded me of Coppola. It also reminded me\u000asomewhat of The Hill,Pappilon,Brubaker which are one of my favorite\u000afilms about incarceration.Which brings me to my only discontent about\u000aShawshank Redemption: the fact that Andy Dufresne succeeds in solving\u000aeverything so completely. Revenge,freedom,happiness,reward for his\u000apatience and determination, all with one precise blow. And fate somehow\u000acooperates.Well,that's too much for me.The happy ending was nice,but it\u000awas a bit too happy.It really goes straight for that pure part of our\u000abeing that would want everything to be spectacular and complete, which\u000agives us great emotions but ultimately "insults" our common sense.Andy\u000aDufresne managed to beat the system. It took 18 years but he did it.\u000aBeautiful but I don't buy that. Makes for a great movie but doesn't\u000aleave much room to meditate.However I wouldn't even think of rating\u000athis one less than 9 and really deserves top marks. However,looking\u000aaround me and thinking about my fate and the fate of others and the\u000afate of the world, I see no Andy Dufresne's. I see the warden, I see\u000aRed and I see almost all characters but not Andy.He's like Tristan or\u000aHeracles to me,and I don't believe in those hero myths.So,almost\u000aperfect movie,but I'll make and take a point by rating it 9.\u000a

V\u000aGood movie but 9 is too extreme, is certainly one of the masterpieces\u000aof cinema, but like many Hollywood movies there is some bad things,\u000awhen the protagonist moves down the sewer pipe, in reality it would be\u000acaught bad. A very nice movie that you can refer to the way that each\u000aof us must do just to get out of certain problems. After all you put\u000apoor grades to great films, especially horror. Hardly comes out of jail\u000ain a tunnel of excrement, jail and violence and degradation but you can\u000aget out mainly in Italy. However great interpretation of Morgan\u000aFreeman, many sentences are historical and should keep in mind. In the\u000amovies there must be some humanity in this film there is too much\u000aviolence\u000a

V\u000aI break my reviewing of movies down into five aspects, each worth two\u000astars, plot, characters, cinematography, soundtrack, and acting. So\u000ahere's my broken down review of Shawshank Redemption: Plot: One star.\u000aWhile the plot flows neatly, is well developed, and doesn't have any\u000aloopholes I noticed, it lacks the originality one would expect from the\u000atop rated movie on IMDb. I have no complaints other than the lack of\u000aproviding me with something truly original and complex. It's not a\u000asimple plot, per say, just as it's not an unoriginal plot, but it is by\u000ano means an extremely original or complex plot.Characters: Two stars. No characters went blatantly against psychology,\u000anor did they ever break their characterization. Characterization was\u000apretty good and I have no real complaints, all I would have to question\u000ais Andy's character. He was gang raped and got his ass kicked multiple\u000atimes and was still this calm, cool, collected guy. I don't see how\u000athat would work out in the real world, so I didn't find that really\u000abelievable, but he kept with his characterization and the movie made up\u000afor it with the almost relatable nature of Red's character and how well\u000athe minor characters were developed. That's probably what blew me away\u000acharacter-wise. No character was exceptionally complex, but all stayed\u000atrue to their characterization. However, Andy should have been more\u000acomplex than he was, seeing as how he was the main character.Cinematography: Two stars. I have no complaints. Camera angles,\u000aeffects, etc. were very good, though there was nothing exceptional\u000aabout them that really stood out to me. Though I do realize that it was\u000apretty well done for a 90's movie. Again, no complaints.Soundtrack: Two stars. Again, very well done, no complaints here. At no\u000atime did it overshadow dialogue, and at no time were there awkward\u000asilences. However, nothing really stood out to me. Not a soundtrack I'd\u000ago on raving to my friends about, but no complaints.Acting: One star. This is obviously unexpected. I mean, Morgan Freeman\u000aand Tim Robbins...I was surprised I didn't find it amazing. But Morgan\u000aFreeman's monologues lacked heart and Tim Robbins' character didn't\u000agive him any room for heart to be placed into it. Again, the best\u000aacting in the movie, in my opinion, would be from the minor characters.\u000aFrank Medrano is worth note, in my opinion, as he was very, very good.\u000aBut he didn't remain in the movie long, so him and the other minor\u000acharacters didn't make it enough for me to give acting two stars. I'm\u000asure many people would disagree, though.All in all, I give this movie eight stars and would recommend it to a\u000afriend, but I wouldn't have it rated first on IMDb because, while it\u000awas very good, it didn't strike me as THAT good. There are more\u000aoriginal movies out there that I would recommend before this, though I\u000ado recommend that people watch this movie along with the others.\u000a

V\u000aI like this movie all right, I would not rank it on my top movies of\u000aall time and I am also not the type of person to give every movie I see\u000aeither a nine or ten or one and two. There are six other numbers in\u000abetween and I use them all and I say this one warrants a seven. The\u000amovie about two inmates becoming friends in a corrupt prison has its\u000acharm. It also has its bad points that being the evil prison system\u000awith its mean warden and guards who batter the prisoners. Still, I can\u000arole with that as I can the fact that Tim Robbins is horribly cast in\u000athis film. When he first arrives at Shawshank he does the role\u000aperfectly, however his performance never changes throughout the movie.\u000aHe still talks softly, still has the same look, the guy has supposedly\u000aspent some time here so he is going to change even if he does not lose\u000ahis hope. There are many positives too though as Morgan Freeman\u000aliterally carries the film and I loved the ending escape scenes. I also\u000alike the fact I can just start watching this movie in the middle and\u000ajust go on doing something else. Maybe pick it up again later at the\u000abeginning, it is just one of those movies that I can watch it from here\u000aor there and be entertained, but do not necessarily feel I have to\u000awatch it from beginning to end. I know I am now going to be attacked\u000athough as I did not give this movie a nine or ten though. Especially\u000aattacking a movie that so many people think is the greatest thing ever,\u000ahowever this is just an opinion so just chill. At least I did not like\u000ait and give it a one to lower its score like some people have.\u000a

V\u000aI started of watching this movie without any 'hype'. I knew it was a\u000agood film since it claimed the #1 spot in the IMDb top 250 movies.But\u000aafter the credits rolled down,i very well understood why it claimed the\u000a#1 spot. This is a gem of a movie. If you missed it, then go watch it.\u000aIt doesn't have speedy car chases,gripping war sequences or thumping\u000aaction. But it conveys a strong & warm story to the viewers holding\u000athem close. I cant stress more. This is a 'must watch before you die'\u000amovie. or you'll cry in the heaven,having missed out this\u000amasterpiece... Morgan freeman & Tim Robbins are outstanding.

V\u000aI was feeling a little discouraged the other day so I decided to put\u000a"Old Faithful" in the DVD player. Sure enough, after watching it--for\u000awho knows how many times--I felt inspired again. This movie is the best\u000amovie I've ever seen and maybe the best ever made. It's for anyone who\u000aneeds to understand the power of hope--which means it's for everyone\u000aeverywhere. I'm so proud it is the top movie on IMDb's Top 250, it sooo\u000adeserves it. I'm so glad it has touched others the way it touched me.\u000aIf you haven't seen it--first of all, what planet are you on? lol--but\u000aseriously, go rent it. This is a movie that can change a life. If it\u000adoesn't do something to your insides, you probably don't have a pulse.\u000aI'm so grateful to Stephen King for writing it and to Tim Robbins and\u000aMorgan Freeman and the director and others for making it such a classic\u000afilm. THIS is what movie-making was supposed to be.\u000a

V\u000aVery wrong. For so long, I avoided watching this film. I already knew\u000awhat it was going to be like: the slightly above average movie with\u000athemes about hope and freedom. An all-out American flick which only a\u000asentimental American could enjoy, and thus I resented it for holding\u000athe title as the best film ever. When it came to the themes I wasn't\u000awrong; hope & freedom are the skeleton on which this film is built but\u000athe way it is executed far surpassed any anticipation I could have\u000amustered, had I actually looked forward to watch it. Morgan Freeman is\u000asublime as always, Tim Robbins perhaps even better. It slowly develops\u000aand unfolds, which is refreshing compared to all too many fast-cut\u000afilms where it seems that the idea is that fast pace equals quality. I\u000aswallowed Shawshank Redemption whole, and even though I do not agree\u000awith its No. 1 ranking, I can now understand. Great movie!\u000a

V\u000aBoth the story and acting is very good. Though not provoking, the film\u000adoesn't stop when the credits starts rolling. It will make you think.This film slowly takes off and has no really element of suspense. It's\u000aa human story without any fast action. The production contains no\u000asurprises and make the viewer concentrate 100% on the story....but my single issue is how long it takes for the film to get\u000ainteresting. For me almost an hour. Maybe this is necessary to build up\u000athe story. A high rated film needs to be great from the start. The\u000afirst part is a film true to it's genre and quite predictable.I can's stop thinking that this film's outstanding rating on IMDb, like\u000asome others, maintain their position of obvious reasons. When a film\u000a(or music album)is considered among the best, new reviewers are\u000aaffected by this status.\u000a

V\u000aMost of the movie is great, but i think that the ending was bad.\u000aDufresne telling Red about the field and Zihuatanejo makes it too to\u000afigure out that they'll both end up free and happy :) A very dramatic\u000amovie until then and with some funny catch lines from time to time.\u000aGreat acting by not only Tim and Morgan but by most of the actors. The\u000asmall "stories" besides the main one makes it great, too. The library,\u000aRed's tries to get released, the boy who had met the one who committed\u000athe crime that Dufresne was sentenced for and such things help the\u000amovie going on without making it boring. I also think that it isn't a\u000amovie that can be seen a lot of times but i'm not sure before having\u000aseen it a couple of times more\u000a

V\u000aWhat is the movie about? The movie begins with Andy Dufresne in a Maine\u000acourtroom. He was prosecuted for the murder of his ex-wife and her\u000aboy-friend. He received two life sentences. Being the manager of a bank\u000ahe was very shocked at the long sentence. When Andy arrived at Shawshank Prison, life was very difficult. He did\u000ameet one person who became his best friend. Andy was hunted by some gay\u000aprisoners; they beat him up all the time. Red got Andy away from the\u000agang saving his life. Andy and Red always hung out and took care of\u000aeach other after that. Twenty years passed and a new inmate at Shawshank told Andy about a\u000acell-mate in another prison. This cell-mate was a born killer. He loved\u000adescribing his crimes. One of his stories was about two lovers who were\u000amurdered. He continued to say that the woman was the wife of a banker\u000aand he was found guilty and received the same sentence as Andy. Andy\u000aknew that this person he was being told about was himself.During Dufresne\u2019s time in prison he was the Warden\u2019s account. Samual\u000aNorton, the Warden, took huge bribes but Andy covered his tracks. When\u000aAndy went to the Warden with evidence that would set him free Norton\u000ahad Andy\u2019s witness murdered. He did not want to be discovered as a\u000acrook.Andy escaped from Shawshank through the sewage pipes with Norton\u2019s bank\u000astatements and checkbook. Andy Dufresne cashed in the Warden\u2019s money\u000aand the Norton committed suicide. In the end Red was released from Shawshank and joined Andy in\u000aZihuatanejo, Mexico.Main Characters:\u2022 Tim Robbins (Andy Dufresne) \u2013 Andy was a bank manager from a bank in\u000aBangor, Maine. He spent 20 years in Shawshank being innocent. \u2022 Morgan\u000aFreeman (Ellis Boyd 'Red' Redding) \u2013 He was in Shawshank for a murder\u000ahe committed when he was a teenager. When Andy arrived at the prison,\u000aRed had already spent 20 years. \u2022 Bob Gunton (Warden Norton) \u2013 Seemed\u000ato start off the movie as a tough but fair prison warden. As the movie\u000awent on, he became corrupt. He made prisoners work on roads and farms\u000abut collected money for himself from the State. \u2022 Clancy Brown (Capitan\u000aHadley) \u2013 He was the worst guard at Shawshank. He beat many convicts to\u000adeath. He was the Warden\u2019s \u2018pet.\u2019My opinion about this movie: This is one of the best movies I have\u000aseen. The acting was excellent. Even though the movie was set in a\u000aprison, it was a story about real friendship in a difficult setting.\u000a

V\u000aDarabonts film about an innocent banker and his troubles inside a\u000amaximum security prison with a tough warden (Gunton). Andy (robbins)\u000abefriends an inmate whose friendship gives him hope and is the backbone\u000aof the film, Morgan Freeman plays this role superbly in what i think is\u000athe actor's best performance of all time. This is Freeman's film,\u000athough Robbins is great in the lead and Gunton is a hell of an\u000aantagonist. Everything about this film is perfect, so i can completely\u000asee why its the 3rd best film of all time on IMDb. I am a big fan and\u000ahave watched it 5 times and wouldn't mind on seeing it again later down\u000athe line. IMDb Rating: 9.2 MY Rating: 10/10\u000a

V\u000aThe direction, the acting, the writing, absolutely everything about\u000athis film is masterful.To start off with, the acting is excellent.Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman both give what are arguably the\u000aperformances of their career. Robbins acts with subtlety and\u000aunderstatement, speaking his lines and manipulating his body language\u000awith an effortless grace. Freeman's acting and narration are brilliant,\u000ain particular his monologue near the end.The direction is some of the best, a surprising and resounding foray\u000ainto big budget films by Frank Darabont.And of course, the writing is the true shining feature. The creativity\u000aof the story, and the twists that give us the ultimate satisfaction are\u000ararities among modern American films.This movie, is unquestionably one of the best films of the 1990s, and\u000aperhaps one of the best that has ever been made\u000a

This movie was amazing\u000aand was instantly my favorite movie. Morgan Freeman is absolutely\u000aperfect and so are Robbins and the rest of the cast. Wonderfully well\u000aput together as Freeman narrates his character's (Red) thoughts which I\u000athought was pretty cool.I've never written a comment on IMDb, but this moment compelled me to\u000awrite one. By far my favorite movie of all time.\u000a

V\u000aAndy Dufresne is a young and successful banker whose life changes\u000adrastically when he is convicted and sentenced to life imprisonment for\u000athe murder of his wife and her lover. Set in the 1940's, the film shows\u000ahow Andy, with the help of his friend Red, the prison entrepreneur,\u000aturns out to be a most unconventional prisoner.I've heard much about this movie. I've heard great things about this\u000amovie; wait, scratch that. I've heard brilliant things about this movie\u000a(considering that this is #2 on the top 250 list in IMDb). I didn't\u000areally expect much from this movie because of the long running time and\u000athat this film (I thought) was about redemption. Boy, did it blow me\u000aaway!It didn't blow me away as far as people have been blown like a huge\u000atornado have wrecked the country. It had blown me away like a strong\u000awind would've knocked me down. It wasn't all that great (like a\u000amasterpiece) but it was an extremely satisfying film.The performances in here were pretty much rock solid as far as playing\u000atwo men in jail can go. The score was indeed very pleasing to one's\u000aears. What else to say? Oh, the story may feel dark but there are some\u000apoints where there are some light-heartedness and comedic scenes.This film won me over. It pretty much won everyone over with it's great\u000astory and heart. Overall, as I said, it was extremely satisfying to\u000awatch from beginning to end. It didn't drag a bit even for a two and\u000aalmost a half hour film. Watch it and you'll be blown away; but not as\u000amuch as many others have been.\u000a

V\u000aPerhaps the greatest movie ever made, The Shawshank Redemption tells\u000athe touching and emotive story of the Andy Dufrain. Wrongly convicted\u000aof a dual murder, Dufrain is sent to the to the infamous walls of\u000aShawshank Prison and the film explores his lifetime of experiences\u000athere.Throughout the film the audience is supplied with a variety of details\u000aand subplots. What is amazing however is the director's ability to\u000acleverly weave these details into the conclusion and to give each a\u000aremarkable significance.The film features some of the best acting to record and by far the\u000agreatest narrator, Morgan Freeman.

V\u000ai first heard of the shawshank redemption whilst watching the Oscars in\u000a1994 and i was filled with the usual negative pre conceptions-old\u000afashioned film,prison film,and a long film.therefore it was another 12\u000amonths before i watched it due to every man and his dog raving about\u000ait.i was then taken back by what is probably the only perfect film i\u000ahave ever seen.from the damning of andy in the opening scene,the\u000ahorrific suicide and rape scenes,the central relationship between red\u000aand andy,reds parole knockbacks,the enthralling escape right up to the\u000auplifting ending,this is cinematic perfection and i doubt that as the\u000ayears pass by Hollywood will ever be capable of making a film of this\u000acalibre again\u000a

V\u000aI have recently watched The Shawshank Redemption. To put it simply as\u000apossible, it is a great piece of movie history.This movie deserves to be where it is (second)on the best Two hundred\u000aand fifty greatest films of all time.The Shawshank Redemption is basically about a prisoner, who is in\u000aShawshank prison because of a murder which he didn't commit. The\u000aprisoner is a banker called Andy dufresne. As the film shows Andy is a\u000ahonest man. Andy is also a committed man. Andy is acted by Tim Robbins.\u000aAndy Dufresne makes a strong friendship with a man nicknamed Red. Red\u000ais acted by Morgan Freeman. I think this movie is on of the best I've\u000aever seen I would rate it 9 out of 10.\u000a

V\u000aThis is one of my favourite films of all time, but I would never have\u000awatched it if it hadn't been recommended because prison films are not\u000ausually my thing. Of course it is Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman that\u000ahelp make the film so perfect but also it has got to be the story. It\u000ais perfection and proof that Hollywood can still make good films. Why\u000adid it not win the Oscar? By far the best thing about it is that after\u000aall the troubles the two leading characters go through there is a happy\u000aending (which is not contrived) that leaves you feeling happy and\u000auplifted. If you have seen and liked "The Green Mile" try this one as\u000ait is even better!\u000a

V\u000aI stopped to see Shawshank when I was driving through Cincinnati. The\u000atheater was speckled with moviegoers.. all unaware of what an\u000aincredible cinematic achievement they were about to witness. There\u000awasn't the slightest sound from the audience....they were mesmerized.\u000aThe Jail(was in Mansield,Oh./now torn down), the music, the fantastic\u000aperformances from a slew of great actors, Whitmore as Brooks, Robbins\u000aas Andy Dufresne, and Morgan Freeman as Red,..they all did a\u000aspectacular job. This is a film(one of the few)...that will leave it's\u000aaudience in tears of happiness. The narration from Freeman is written\u000awith care and this film is crafted and paced with a precision that\u000aHollywood hasn't seen in a long, long, time. "I hope to see the\u000aPacific...I hope it is as blue as it is in my dreams". This film\u000aaddresses many moral trust issues....from being raped in jail, to\u000afinding a friend amongst criminals, to being unjustly incarcerated and\u000athen shunned when you prove your innocence.."how could you be so\u000aobtuse?".....in the end it is the simplest thing, friendship, that is\u000asynonymous with freedom. This was the last time I was in a theater that\u000acheered at the credits....and the only time an audience...so small in\u000anumbers...ever did that. One of my top 5 favorite films of all-time.\u000a98/100\u000a

V\u000aThe film tells the story of Andy Dufresne (Tim Robbins), an educated\u000abanker sentenced to life for the murder of his wife and her lover. In\u000aprison, Andy inspires his fellow inmates with his courage and humanity\u000aand has a profound effect on Red (Morgan Freeman), an older prisoner,\u000awho has given up hope.Unlike many films of the 90's, "The Shawshank Redemption" has "high\u000aconcept" plot premise and is somewhat episodic compared with the tight,\u000alinear narratives of closer structured pictures. This sense of freedom\u000ain the storytelling allows the film to consistently throw up genuine\u000asurprises, as the viewer isn't constantly on guard for clues and plot\u000apoints. In hindsight, we tend to forget how successfully director Frank\u000aDarabont leads us to expect a very different resolution."The Shawshank Redemption" does things well that you might not expect.\u000aIt has lengthy voice-overs (that actually work well) and it has a sappy\u000apredictable ending, but yet these elements work because they are not\u000aplaced in the over-used, meaningless context that movies today place\u000athem in. The voice overs are also consistently used in such a way that\u000adistinct worlds are created. There's a real world inside the prison and\u000athe surreal outside world.These two distinct worlds are created help to place the viewer inside\u000athe halls of the prison, they are no longer watching a movie, but they\u000aare also feeling it.This is a movie that will remain a favorite of the people for many\u000adecades to come. 10/10\u000a

Tim\u000aRobbins adopts the role of Andy Dufresne as his own and Morgan freeman\u000aplays Red in an emotional and convincing manner and really did shine\u000athroughout the film.

V\u000aThis movie is so much more than what one would make out of it by simply\u000alooking at actors, director and plot outline. Its the synergy of all\u000athese parts that makes it one of the greatest of all time. TSR is a\u000ametaphor for all the important questions in life. The limits we set on\u000aourselves, the ease of falling into conformity and our fear to hope for\u000athe best for our self's. The movie is about hope, in times of struggle,\u000ain times of extreme hardships and injustices, its about enduring and\u000acrawling trough all this s*** and seek the redemption outside in the\u000asoft rain from heaven. Its simply a "to be, or not to be". I could\u000awrite cheesy metaphors all night but I'm gonna stop now. I love this\u000amovie simply because it gives me hope, its helped me trough my life's\u000ahardships, heartbreak and injustice, its helped me to get trough these\u000atimes and made me love life more than life itself.\u000a

V\u000aThis is my all-time favorite movie, tied with Good Will Hunting. What a\u000aclear and incredible experience i had trough this!! i'm still\u000abreathless.This incredible film based on a short story by Stephen King (Rita\u000aHayworth and the Shawshank Redemption) shows the story of Andy Dufresne\u000a(Tim Robbins), an important banker who is convicted to life\u000aimprisonment, accused of the murderer of his wife and her lover;\u000aDufresne then goes to the Shawshank prison where an incredible story of\u000ahope takes place!, he meets Ellis Boyd Redding, best known as Red\u000a(Morgan Freeman), also a life imprisonment convict who is well\u000arespected in the prison; Dufresne begin to demonstrate that he isn't an\u000ausual convict, gaining admiration and respect off the inmates, and\u000amaintaining the hope in a drab and corrupt prison.It's incredible how the greatness of a human being can promote the most\u000awonderful feelings in the people, and how a really strong character can\u000amaintain his values, principles and dreams amongst any situation. This\u000amovie touched my soul, gave me a clear and fresh feeling and is a daily\u000aguide to my life! It also demonstrate the importance of the reading,\u000aeducation and self improvement, challenges, perseverance in reaching\u000agoals, and love of the true meaning of life!.The quality of the film is incredible; the directing of Frank Darabont\u000ais outstanding; Morgan Freeman is absolutely outstanding too!, Tim\u000aRobbins is excellent, their friends roles are touching: Heywood\u000a(William Sandler), Tommy (Gil Bellows) Brooks (James Whitmore); the\u000aprison guards, specially Warden Samuel Norton (Bub Gunton) and Captain\u000aHealey (Clancy Brown) have a good acting also.A movie that is worth to buy and see forever, is the movie that touch\u000ayour soul and left a sense of clearness, a movie to teach to your kids\u000athe importance of holding to what you really are, and to always, in any\u000asituation maintain the hope. 10/10 and my all time favorite!!\u000a

V\u000aThis movie is certainly VERY well done. The plot is nice (Stephen King\u000anever fails you down) and acting is superb, in particular Tim Robbins\u000aand Bob Gunton, the director. You should see it, but in my opinion it\u000ais not very original among "jail-movie" and not worthy of such a high\u000aposition, ranking on the IMDb's top 250 list.Another minor point which prevent the movie to get an excellent movie\u000ais the fact that all characters are "one-dimensional stereotype". I\u000amean that in this movie characters can be extremely positive or\u000aextremely negative, sometimes forgetting that human beings have complex\u000abehavior.\u000a

V\u000athis movie took my breath away. it is a thought provoking, beautifully\u000aacted, gorgeously filmed, uplifting film that never disappoints. Tim\u000aRobins and Morgan both give award winning performances and it is very\u000aodd when one realizes the lack of awards this movie received. Do not\u000alet the lack of awards dissuade you though as Shawshank Redemption is\u000aquite possibly the best movie i have ever seen, i just cant emphasize\u000ahow good this movie is. Please do yourself a favor and see this film\u000aright now if you haven't already. If there was one good deed that could get you into heaven then watching\u000athis movie would be it.\u000a

V\u000aIt is a great film because of the details that are used in the film.\u000athe thing about the story and the movie itself is it is told from Red's\u000apoint of view making sure you know his opinion on it and what happened\u000ainstead of having to figure it out on yourself. it, to this day is my\u000afavorite movie to watch and there will never be another movie like it\u000ain my opinion. the things that andy does go through hit you hard\u000abecause you always see prisoners on TV but you never see an innocent\u000aman that you know is innocent going to jail for life. the friends he\u000amake are also very good additions that help the story and shows the\u000acorruptness of prisons in captain hadley nd the warden. there are a lot\u000aof memorable quotes in the movie also. such as "get busy living or get\u000abusy dyin'". the shawshank redemption shows the hardships people can go\u000athrough when throws a curveball their way and how they deal with it.\u000a

V\u000aThe greatness of "The Shawshank Redemption" is all the great values\u000athis film is built on - love, friendship, lending hand to another man.\u000aWhat is also wonderful about this film is its combination of its\u000aserious moments with the beautiful humour. In addition, the film has a\u000athird-person narrator which adds a lot of meaning to it and allows to\u000adevelop a closer relationship with Red and - through Red - with Andy.\u000aAs for Stephen King's story that the film is based on, it a bit\u000adisappointed me. However, after reading it I appreciated Frank\u000aDarabont's work even more - I saw how much imagination and creativity\u000ahe had to use for "The Shawshank Redemption". Lastly, the score is so\u000abeautiful you can cry at moments, e.g. the piece accompanying the\u000aarrival of Andy's transport to the Shawshank Prison. I guess I watched\u000athis movie five times and think I will watch it many times more. I\u000arecommend it to everyone.\u000a

V\u000a*The Shawshank SPOILERS* In the early '20s, Andy Dufresne (Tim Robbins), a quiet bank employee,\u000ais arrested, tried and sentenced to life in prison for the murders of\u000ahis wife and her lover, murders that he didn't commit.The calm man has to rough up really soon, in order to survive life in\u000athe Shawshank prison, but manages to develop a friendship with a fellow\u000ainmate called Red (Morgan Freeman) and to be employed in the\u000acontability office by the corrupt director of Shawshank, thus helping\u000ahis escape plan...When I first watched this movie, a few years ago, I was so in awe that\u000aas soon as I got out of school (where me and my classmates watched it\u000aduring a morning without teachers) I went and bought it.It's an instant classic, an inspiring movie, based upon a short story\u000aby Stephen King (!), marvelously written, acted and directed, and fully\u000adeserving of being owned.The Shawshank Redemption: 10/10.\u000a

V\u000aMovie right at the beginning starts showing its quality of dialogues\u000aand thats the key for bounding the viewers .Then a fine story with\u000agreat actors leaves an everlasting impression. Point of life after\u000aprison is also shown with a heart touching scene.Humanity in prison is\u000araised by another scene. Overall this movie can't be compared with\u000aothers as such a style of escape can't be said to be inspired.Atlast\u000athe movie gives a message of friendship,love and hope. A way of making\u000aprisoner's life more useful to the society and how education can affect\u000athe system is suggested.Combining these all elements in a series of\u000aevents is commendable.The tag line of this movie is inspiring.\u000a

V\u000aThis is definitely the best film I've ever seen.Ever What pulled me in\u000ais how much you start to feel for these characters as if their real\u000apeople. Another thing that I liked is how the characters change for\u000aexample Andy(main character) at the start hes a healthy looking man and\u000aafter 20 years he has grey hairs bags under his eyes and a broken\u000aspirit.In the end you don't care what happens to the warden you don't\u000acare if he becomes president as long as Andy escapes.In truth this is a\u000alove story but not a regular love story this is A story of two of the\u000amost unlikely candidates.There's Andy a hardworking lawyer and then\u000athere's red sent to prison at the age of 18 for murder and armed\u000arobbery two polar opposites but in the end they might as well be\u000afamily.This is the single most powerful movie ever at the end I was\u000acrying something that has never happened before anyway this is a film\u000ato see before you die words cant honestly explain how great this film\u000ais you have to see it.\u000a

V\u000aI personally think that the way this movie touches me cannot be put\u000ainto words. The core of this movie is hope: hope that overcomes every\u000aobstacle placed in your way, the knowing that the wronged people in\u000alife can triumph over evil. This is what Andy Dufresne achieves, and\u000athe tag line of "Fear can hold you prisoner, hope can set you free" is\u000aperfect The underlying theme is friendship, and Andy and Reds\u000afriendship is perfectly portrayed here by Morgan Freeman and Tim\u000aRobbins. They are both fine actors, and I feel here they give career\u000abest performances(although Morgan Freeman is generally good in\u000aeverything). Morgan Freeman should of won an Oscar for his subtle\u000aapproach to this role - surely his million dollar baby Oscar is a\u000abelated one for this movie too? The directing, the story and everything\u000acombine to make this a special movie - don't worry, the ratings in the\u000aall time list, which always put this movie in the top 5, are not wrong.\u000aThis is a movie everyone must see!!!\u000a

V\u000aI watched the Shawshank Redemption.I went on to the message board seeing many threads about it being\u000aoverrated. I told myself that I shouldn't be surprised since it is\u000aNumber 2 on the Top 250, quite an honor indeed.So times passes...and I think about it. I see the movie again on\u000aShowtime, a movie channel....and after it is over for a second time, I think, "This movie is\u000aflawless." The acting, the direction, the pace, the adaption, the\u000amusic, the set, the cinematography, the script...flawless? This is what\u000aI was telling myself.This is a claim that I, myself, think is pretty crazy...but I think the\u000areason the Shawshank Redemption is looked down upon is because it is\u000aflawless.And even if that isn't true, that is how I feel about it.10/10.\u000a

V\u000aI do think some films get better the more you view them. "Shawshank" is\u000asuch a film. Whever I stumble across it on a cable channel, I am simply\u000aunable to break away from it, even though I've seen it a dozen times.\u000aThe best films are "simple stories, well told." From the script, to the\u000aacting, to the direction, to the sets, and - most importantly - in its\u000amessage, "The Shawshank Redemption" is absolutely first-rate. It's\u000aalways fun to see a wronged man win in the end, but in this story it is\u000athe manner in which Andy prevails that is so gripping. The scene in\u000awhich Tim Robbins as Andy ponders if he is in some way responsible for\u000ahis fate because of his thoughts is amazing. And Morgan Freeman's\u000agreatest film moment comes when he faces the parole board one more\u000atime. Most movies blow from your mind minutes after the final credits,\u000athis one stays with you forever. I'm ready to see it again.\u000a

V\u000ai've seen the top 50 films in the IMDb top 250 category and a number of\u000atimes I've felt that a movie wasn't worth its ranking. the shawshank\u000aredemption fits this bill in not being placed number one. and this\u000acoming from a die-hard god father fan must surely mean something. the\u000astoryline, the cinematography and the acting are all masterpieces in\u000atheir own right. the story of a wronged person accepting his fate and\u000athen changing it is remarkable, for everyone relates to it, though\u000amaybe not to the extent portrayed here. kudos to stephen king and frank\u000adarabont and the actors for a great movie. its a real pity that it won\u000ano Oscars. this is one movie i would have hated to miss. truly\u000aexceptional.\u000a

V\u000a*spoilers*The first time I saw "The Shawshank Redemption",I was simply blown away\u000aby how powerful this movie is. There are no action sequences or\u000aromances, but the subtle drama of a man who is wrongly accused is\u000aeasily identifiable, possibly because we realize that it could happen\u000ato anyone. What makes the main character (Andy Dufrene) find the strength to\u000asurvive his term of life in prison is his knowledge of his innocence,\u000aand his friendship with Red, a convicted murderer, who is slowly\u000areforming throughout the movie. The end of the movie is perhaps one of\u000athe most uplifting scenes I have ever watched, as justice finally\u000aprevails, due to Andy's determination and careful planning.I never get tired of this movie. From the beginning of the movie where\u000aAndy considers murder, to his incarceration for that same\u000amurder(ironically committed by someone else), and his long stay in\u000aprison under a cruel warden, and finally the best-ever use of a Raquel\u000aWelch art poster. Ever.I highly encourage this movie to anyone who hasn't seen it. It is a\u000aclassic, and the acting is superb. Even smallest roles are memorable.\u000a

V\u000aThis is one of the best stories of freedom in the world. It shows how\u000athe human heart can work to get you out of the worst situations. Sure i\u000anever cried during watching it but it made me feel good.This movie tells a tale back in 1949, a man is convicted of the murder\u000aof his wife and her lover(sound familiar 'Green Mile'/Stephen King\u000afans?). Of course with all Stephen King's twisted books/movies... he\u000adidn't do it but he is sent to prison anyway. Since prisoners were\u000athought of lesser human in the 40's-70's if you were caught doing\u000asomething you weren't suppose to(or if yo u just annoy the guards) you\u000aare beaten badly. Luckily Andy Dufrense makes acquaintances with the\u000awarden and guards. He makes friends with 'Red' Redding(Nicely done by Morgan Freeman), a\u000aman who can get you anything from the outside. They bond together with\u000aother inmates and conquer over the warden. BUT one day a new inmate\u000acomes in and tells the story of how he knows Andy is instant.The rest people can figure out for their own but they have to be\u000acareful... though this is one of Stephen King's rare dramas, it will\u000ahave the evilness and twists that we all love him for. Plus look for\u000athe most feel good ending in the world. I'm honest this ending will\u000ashock you so much and make you want to know more of what happened.\u000a

With limited expectations, I came out totally\u000aenthralled by a magnificent cinematic experience - one that you all too\u000ararely enjoy. To me you have to take inspiration from Defrene; no\u000amatter how tough your situation is, you need to focus on what you want\u000ato achieve and retain the belief that your dreams can come true. The\u000ascene on top of the roof, drinking beer is tops. Only wish I knew where\u000amy son has posted the DVD! We have to watch it on video now!\u000a

V\u000aIf you have never seen this film do your self a favour, go rent the DVD\u000anow and prepare to have yourselves one of the best evenings\u000aentertainment you are ever likely to have in front of a TV set. Right\u000afrom the opening scenes when you see the dramatic sweeping aerial shots\u000aof the prison you know that you are in for something special. When I\u000afirst read the synopsis for this film, and saw it described as a brutal\u000aprison drama I thought it wasn't the kind of film I would enjoy. Boy\u000awas I wrong I think that Shawshank is the best film I have ever seen.\u000aIts much more than a brutal prison drama it's a film of friendship,\u000ainjustice, resolve and most of all hope. The film tells the story of\u000aAndy wrongly convicted and imprisoned for the murder of his wife and\u000aher lover and the friendship he forms with Red a long serving inmate.\u000aAndy isn't like most of the other prisoners he's quiet, educated, plays\u000achess and has a middle class background. Red is from the streets a\u000aseasoned prisoner who serves his time with weary resignation. Their\u000aunlikely friendship blossoms and grows in to love, of the non-sexual\u000atype, and it's this bond this friendship that is the centre of the\u000afilm. The performances given by Morgan Freeman and Tim Robbins are\u000aastounding, sorry Tom Hanks but I think Morgan/Tim were robbed of the\u000aOscar that year. I love the tag line from the film "Fear can hold you\u000aprisoner but hope can set you free" WOW an amazing, moving triumph of a\u000afilm, if you haven't seen it yet what are you waiting for! Watching The\u000aShawshank Redemption is one of those things you have to do before you\u000adie.\u000a

V\u000aA heartbreaking story fraught with Passion, Loss, A Dream, and\u000aFriendship. There's only so much i can say about a film that is loved\u000aby millions and yet misunderstood by more. It's the visual version of a\u000amusical ballad. A soft and thoughtful piece and yet created by a hard\u000acentre and churned by the brilliant hands of Frank Darabont and the\u000agreat acting of both Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman. A True Classic."Andy Dufresne, is sent to Shawshank Prison for the murder of his wife\u000aand secret lover. He is very isolated and lonely at first, but realises\u000athere is something deep inside your body, that people can't touch and\u000aget to....'HOPE'. Andy becomes friends with prison 'fixer' Red (Morgan\u000aFreeman), and Andy epitomises why it is crucial to have dreams. His\u000aspirit and determination, leads us into a world full of imagination,\u000afilled with courage and desire. Will Andy ever realise his dreams...?"\u000a

V\u000aThis is not a bad film, and I would recommend renting it. But its\u000aadmirers who rank it as one of the best films of all time -- even above\u000aclassics like Citizen Kane or The Godfather -- are seriously overrating\u000ait.The popularity of this film apparently comes from its uplifting message\u000aabout the power of hope. Nothing else in Shawshank Redeption is\u000aextraordinary. The acting is only good: indeed, Tim Robbins's acting of\u000aAndy Dufresne is two-dimensional. Morgan Freeman is much better as Red.\u000aThe photography is unremarkable. Most seriously, however, the moral\u000adilemmas in this film are melodramatic and black-and-white. Andy\u000aDufresne is impossibly noble. The guards and, especially, the warden\u000aare unbelievably evil and corrupt. It's nice to think a prison would be\u000areformed by building a nice library. But sorry, folks, the world is\u000amore complicated than that. At best, this film can be enjoyed as a kind\u000aof uplifting fable, a sort of fairy-story for adults. Nobody struggles\u000awith the ambiguities and complexities of real life in this film, and so\u000athe "redemption" it offers is false.As a point of comparison, take another film in this "criminal\u000aredemption" genre -- Dead Man Walking, a film, significantly, by Tom\u000aRobbins. Here is real, tough, moral drama. Can we forgive the Shawn\u000aPenn character? Is his redemption real? The film poses these questions\u000awithout answering them. Plus the acting is rich and nuanced, the\u000adirection riveting. Dead Man Walking is much better film than Shawshank\u000aRedemption because it's about real life.\u000a

V\u000aThis is possibly the best film ever made. Everything from the script\u000aand acting to the camera work and set are remarkable. Based on a\u000aStephen King novella, it is easily the best adaption from a written\u000astory ever put to film. Tim Robbin's certainly deserved an Oscar for\u000athis film, his performance was moving yet not overpowering. Even though\u000athe audience is left out of the story in certain parts, we still feel\u000astrongly for his character Andy Dufresne. Morgan Freeman is perfect,\u000aeven though he's not the Irishman that was intended for the role. He\u000anarrates the film with ease and we connect to his character as if we\u000awere a part of the movie. Frank Darabont, director of the film, allowed\u000aus to feel what Andy was feeling through the use of small stories and\u000acamera shots. The immensity of the prison can be felt instantly from\u000aour first viewing. The connection the audience makes to the film as a\u000awhole makes The Shawshank Redemption what it is: one of the best films\u000aever made.\u000a

V\u000aI'm not going to say anything about the movie and how great it was. It\u000awas and IS the greatest movie ever made.But i just wonder, why all the good movies are made in 1994. All my\u000afavorite movies are made back in 1994. Maverick, Forrest Gump and\u000aShawshank Redemption. All of these movies are my favorites. No doubt\u000aabout it. And specially Shawshank Redemption.But back to 21st century. Why the Hollywood are not producing good\u000adecent movies anymore? I think it's all about the money, they want to\u000amake big profits, they just don't care about anything else. Quick\u000amovies, big profits, a lot of audience. What else do you need??? I\u000athink people need to see some ART. It would be great to see similar\u000amovies again. And i don't mean similar by plot, they must move your\u000aheart similarly.Shawshank Redemption gave me so much inspiration what to do with my\u000alife and i'm going to do it. Dreaming is bad if there's no hope. At\u000aleast i have some hope and it keeps me alive.\u000a

V\u000aAfter watching useless film after useless film, I always come back to\u000athis. It acts as a benchmark and I must remind myself to watch it more\u000aas I find myself become more accommodating to the rubbish which is\u000abeing released these days. How many films do you find yourself counting\u000athe minutes till the end or where the media has created a publicity\u000astorm to cloak the fact their film isn't worth the huge budget they\u000aspent on it? After watching King Kong at Christmas I felt depressed, as\u000ahere was a truly bloated, poorly acted, lazily directed, piece of film\u000awhich was getting rave reviews from the critics and public alike.\u000aPlease feel free to argue against me, but the fact that so few are\u000awilling to state the obvious, that the film wasn't great, just alright\u000aat best, highlights a continuing trend in todays society, that of\u000aapplauding mediocrity.\u000a

V\u000aThis film, a modern fable, is an amazing success story - not in\u000amonetary terms, but in terms of reputation. It began as just another of\u000amany dramas, in this case based on a Stephen King story, and has\u000aemerged as possibly the best film of the decade, the '90s (#2 of the\u000aIMDb top 250 as of this writing, right up there with The Godfather!).\u000aThe story begins as another prison drama but gradually metamorphoses\u000ainto a poetic commentary on friendship and the scope of life. The main\u000acharacter (Robbins) is sent to prison in the late forties for\u000asupposedly murdering his wife. It really is a men's picture; there are\u000aliterally no female characters (the wife appears for a few seconds\u000aearly on in flashback and that's about it, besides a complaining\u000ashopper later; oh, and, of course, Rita Hayworth pops in as herself).\u000aThe film holds many surprises in store for the viewer as the story\u000aprogresses, not the least of which is the subtle revelation, towards\u000athe end, that the main character may just be Freeman's (how appropriate\u000ais that name!). If one had to pick one reason for this film's success\u000a(and there are probably several), it's that it's probably the best\u000adepiction of friendship between men on celluloid - no cutesy\u000abuddy-buddy stuff, no homo-erotic connotations - just a solid, adult\u000abasis for two men to bond over and remain friends.But there are many other, I dare say, cool aspects to the film. Most\u000aeveryone who has seen this has at least two or three favorite scenes\u000awhich they remember forever and which they watch over and over. My\u000apersonal favorite is the one on the roof, where Andy (Robbins) makes\u000ahis bid for a slightly better existence, taking a big risk with the\u000acaptain of the guards (Clancy Brown, always intimidating). It's a\u000aturning point in the picture and shows two important matters recurring\u000athrough it: taking a risk and using your intelligence. Andy turns out\u000ato be very smart; he's always using his head. And the ultimate\u000aswitchback of the picture, the comeuppance of the evil warden (Bob\u000aGunton, excellent as scum dressed in pricey suits), shows you that a\u000afilm doesn't need a standard shootout to depict the ultimate justice or\u000aretribution. No, if you use your brains, you can really get back at\u000athose oppressive forces seeking to dehumanize you, abuse you, and lord\u000aover you. Boy, can you get them back. I mean really - has there ever\u000abeen a bigger turnaround in the history of cinema? OK, maybe this is\u000awhy this film is rated so high - you just can't get a better release\u000afrom frustration than this, not on film. Here, payback isn't just a\u000abitch - she's the daughter of Satan sent to take you to hell.Another thing to mention is that this film covers about 20 years of\u000atime. That's a long stretch. The film itself is over 2 hours running\u000atime. Most films, even the best ones, with so much to cover, can't help\u000abut sag in places, especially historical pieces. But that's not the\u000acase here. Writer-director Darabont, who also worked on the even longer\u000a"The Green Mile" later, shows us how to create films which are always\u000ainteresting to watch, whether at the one hour or 2-hour mark. Or am I\u000abeing obtuse?\u000a

V\u000aEvery time I watch this movie Its like watching it for the first time.\u000aEverything about it works the characters the story and the direction.\u000aThis movie should be number 1 on IMDb.com. Tim Robbins gives an\u000aexcellent performance and Andy a man accused and sent to prison for\u000akilling his wife a man she was having an affair with. Robbins provides\u000aa subtle quality to his character which has a lot of depth though not\u000aentirely apparent on the surface you can tell it is there. Morgan\u000aFreeman Plays the character red as well as narration for the story. His\u000avoice provides a very powerful way of pushing the story forward which\u000acombined with an excellent score finishes off the movie and makes it a\u000amust see for anyone.\u000a

V\u000abeautiful overhead shot of prison. Roger Deakins is a god. king has\u000anever been treated so soft or tenderly. dialogue is sentimental. Too\u000aso? yeah. music is smooth and sweet. the over-all posture stood is\u000aunexpectedly tough. green mile was a sad shadow of this previous vastly\u000asuperior effort.the Brooks Hatlen interlude was a welcome beat.\u000ameandering is a virtue. i get lost in it's world for a sec. which is\u000arare. the ending makes me cry. freeman is an exceedingly wonderful\u000aactor. strange feelings of elation near ending as if something has\u000aoccurred. Things which haven't. magic of pure Hollywood-style cinema.\u000asamo\u000a

V\u000aWith so many awards and commends, I think I don't have to say more. In\u000aIMDb, it always the top1 or 2 in the list. This movie always is the top\u000a1 in many people. This touching movie is always mentioned on BBS board\u000aagain and again. Without fancy special effects and visual effects,\u000awithout good-looking super stars, without amazing filming tricks, this\u000amovie (the story) is extraordinary. It is touching, and gives all\u000apeople hope. It gives me dreams. Especially at the end of this\u000abeautiful film, when friendship comes, when dreams come true, and when\u000athe light of human's soul is lightened up. This film gives people hope.\u000aI think everyone seeing this movie has been moved. The two main actors\u000aTim Robbins and Morgan Freeman have excellent acting, and the director\u000aFrank Darabont -- he is truly amazing. It is always hard to adapt one\u000ashort story into a film. However, the director've done such an amazing\u000athing. The film is so attractive and the script is perfect. I like the\u000away he uses narration to tell a story. One thing I felt disappointed is\u000afor Academy Award in 1995. I think it is really the most difficult year\u000afor all the members to select for the best picture and the best\u000adirector. I love Forrest Gump and Shawshank Redemption. Both of them\u000aare excellent. If they are in different year, Shawshank Redemption\u000aundoubtedly deserves "the best picture" and "the best director". I\u000awanna give this film eleven out of ten (I do love this movie!) This\u000afilm with no doubt that it is the top3 important movie in film history!\u000aIf you like movies, and you have no chance to see it, go see it!One of the most important films in history.\u000a

V\u000aShawshank IS a very good film but it has too many cliché characters and\u000asituations AND script holes that one can drive a truck through. Gee,\u000athis must be from a Stephen King story. Actually, it's from two of his\u000ashort stories. With King its often quantity and not quality. Despite\u000athat, The Shawshank Redemption is worthwhile.What this film does have is terrific performances from the entire cast\u000aand a sense that an honest man can remain honest, despite the worst of\u000acircumstances. The scenes with the great character actor James\u000aWhitmore, especially those of his trying to cope after his release, are\u000avery well done.The last ten minutes is splendid and almost redeems the rest of the\u000apicture. It gives this film an 8 instead of a 6 in my scale.\u000a

V\u000aThe Shawkshank Redemption's - Review Get busy living get busy dying! Is\u000amerely one of the many great messages this 1994 masterpiece has to\u000aoffer. Originally written as a short story by Stephen King 'The\u000aShawkshank Redemption' has come to be one of the greatest movies of all\u000atime being nominated for 7 Oscars, and winning 11 various other awards.\u000aDirected by Frank Darabont it stars Tim Robbins as 'Andy Dufresne' and\u000aMorgan Freeman as 'Red'. This earlier 19th century film is delivered to\u000aits audience directly through the eyes of 'Red' giving us a strong one\u000amined impersonation of the prison and the people who make up its walls.The life that Andy once had drastically changed when he is charged\u000aguilty for the murder of his wife and her lover. Made to serve 2 life\u000asentences Andy soon got to grips with his new surroundings. But one day\u000ahe pushes aside all moral judgement on one decision that almost as him\u000akilled but his heroism and sheer courage gains him respect from other\u000ainmates at which point he slowly becomes good friends with 'Red' the\u000aman who can get you things. With 'Hope' on his side Andy goes on to do\u000agreat things! The movie rests deeply on the persona built up around\u000aAndy. To some respect the filmmakers regarded him as a religious symbol\u000aand used brief yet powerful references to reflect on this. He would\u000atake up massive challenges helping out the majority all so that I could\u000asimply create a sense of freedom or retained hope in his life. He\u000aconveys a particular demeanour that people tend to associate with\u000a'Christ' and as 'red' quite rightly says, "He strolled. Like a man in a\u000apark without a care or worry".'Character Development' is a complete different term altogether in this\u000amovie, taking us as far into the unknown. Darabont encouraged something\u000adifferent, with twists and turns in the story we are continually struck\u000awith new surprises. By pushing boundaries of modern day cinema,\u000aDarabont exercised in presenting us with new, interesting but most\u000aimportantly feel-good and exiting Characters. This would have never\u000abeen possible without the powerful and striking performances from both\u000a'Tim Robbins' and 'Morgan Freeman', as individuals they play there\u000aseparate roles with a convincing harmony. But as a pair they pitch\u000atogether as if you were husband and wife, the acting is flawless there\u000achemistry works in perfect balance and there absolute ability to grasp\u000athe audience in continuous narrative is something that is rarely\u000awitnessed in a movie.While the characters are unbelievably amazing and the script is\u000aexcellent, it's the extraordinary way this movie uses cinematography to\u000agive us a hardened view into the reality of this film. Thick walls,\u000alarge inescapable fences, and confined spaces all remind us of this\u000aplace we have been brought to. This is spanned onwards with the common\u000ause of relentless Guards marching and the heavy cell bars slamming open\u000aand shut. In a way reinforcing the dull existence these men have to\u000alive with. This is all backed by outstanding crane and helicopter shots\u000afrom the Coen Brother arguably some of the best camera work to date,\u000athe lighting brought not only outstanding quality from the work but it\u000ahelped to create meaning and build layers deep into the story. Finally\u000athe editing was set at a perfect pace and even with regular leaps into\u000afuture the team manages to maintain a high standard from beginning to\u000aend.It is considered as a feel-good classic. But in hindsight thoughts four\u000awalls hold a more grime, corrupt and depressing existences. But it is\u000athe exultance of Writer/Director Frank Darabont who unlike most\u000adirectors forces on the real human issues head on, dealing the problems\u000aof male rape, assault, murder, and abuse in a very effective way. But\u000aby encouraging more enthuses on the strong emotional relationships\u000acreated between you and the characters Darabont was able to stray\u000aaudiences away from this harsh reality into uplifting portrayals of\u000aAndy and his great achievements.Its quite amazing to think how such a great movie would fail to make an\u000aimpact on the big screen and would only pick up fame after it was\u000arealised to video in 1995. But its success was well received and people\u000asoon began to understand what they had been missing. But its only now\u000a10 years on that we begin to see how its success continues to be\u000aharvested and filtered through into many modern day movies.My Personal Rating for this Movie 9/10\u000a

V\u000aI simply cannot understand why this film is so highly regarded. I\u000awanted to watch it because it had such a good write-up, was long, had\u000agreat actors and sounded interesting. And it was... relatively\u000ainteresting. But probably a slightly better than average film. Like\u000a'The Green Mile' it should have been better. It was not emotional or\u000aharrowing enough. There was some silly part of the film that descended\u000ainto a fiscal documentary!!!? 'Patch Adams' is much better. The most\u000ainteresting theme was that prisoners become totally institutionalised\u000aand there were some good moments but overall it was a bit too clichéd.\u000aIt would have been better with a more satisfying finale and a cracking,\u000astring-led score from James Horner or Hans Zimmer.\u000a

V\u000aThis could be the greatest movie ever. It's hard to believe anyone can\u000awatch it and not be touched by it in some way. Who can't identify with\u000athe conception of hope, truly the foundation of this picture. There is\u000aso much raw emotion, and the movie bears upon many. With such brilliant\u000aperformances by the cast, and the amazing job done by Frank Darabont\u000aand co., the viewer becomes immersed in the film, and feels each of\u000athose emotions. It becomes a very personal experience that way. I've not discussed this movie with anyone, at any length, that didn't\u000alove it. It is worthy of every bit of acclaim it continues to receive.\u000aI can't say that The Shawshank Redemption has changed my life as it has\u000afor some, but every time I watch it I'm drawn in again. And every time\u000aI run the emotional gamut it takes us through. It is the one film of\u000awhich I will never tire. -Jason Stanley\u000a

V\u000aThis movie is the greatest prison movie I have ever seen. The storyline\u000ais original and the performance of Tim Robbins is superb. The movie is\u000aabout Andy Dufresne is convicted of the double murder of his wife and\u000aher lover and tells the story of his double life sentence behind bars\u000aat Shawshank prison which uses religion as a form of rehabilitation.\u000aDuring his sentence he is bashed constantly for three years until he\u000ameets a fellow inmate Ellis "Red" Redding who is asked by Dufresne to\u000ahelp him escape. With his escape comes the signature scene as Andy\u000aescapes through the sewers to freedom. The end of the film highlights\u000athe ability of two friends to overcome adversity to achieve a central\u000agoal. The screenplay is superb as this is based on the novel by one of\u000athe best or the best horror of all time, Stephen King. The movie is a\u000amovie that explores the REAL story behind bars and the ability of\u000apeople to escape mentally and spiritually with rehabilitation\u000a

V\u000aWatched The Shawshank Redemption again this evening - what a wonderful\u000astory from beginning to end and. I was intrigued at the end of the\u000acredits to see that the film was dedicated to Allan Greene. Does anyone\u000aknow who he was? I would be grateful for any information. I found the\u000astory within this film demonstrated the human feelings of\u000adespair,helplessness ; anger going on to forward thinking, planning and\u000ahope. Hope that a human being could overcome the corruption and cruelty\u000aby being a lot more clever than the those who only sought to deal in\u000athe destruction of the soul. The tenacity of a man able to withstand 20\u000ayears chipping away with a rock hammer in order to attempt freedom in a\u000aplace where freedom was a word never even contemplated.\u000a

V\u000aI wholeheartedly agree with reismark's review of the film. It is\u000aexcellent. I want to note, however, as the treasurer of a library\u000asystem, that people should remember that rental and purchasing are not\u000athe only options. If you learn about your local libraries, you'll find\u000athat many of them, perhaps most of them, have collections of video on\u000aVHS and DVD which rival rental stores. In most instances, these\u000amaterials circulate without charge, although some libraries charge a\u000anominal fee to rent very recent titles. In the library system to which\u000aI belong, even rental titles are potentially available free, since we\u000ainsist that there must be at least ONE copy in the system which\u000acirculates without a fee.\u000a

V\u000aI saw this movie at the end of a particularly bad and miserable day in\u000amy life and it is safe to say that I was not particularly looking\u000aforward to this one.Two and a half hours later I was on my feet again and was once more\u000aprepared to look the world in the eyes. Such is the power of this\u000amovie.Tim Robbins plays a sincere man who is sent to to jail for a crime he\u000adid not commit. Inside, he meets extraordinary human beings, all of who\u000ayou will fall in love with within minutes of meeting them. Chief among\u000athese is the character of Red, played by none other than the legendary\u000aMorgan Freeman.Together with Andy and Red you learn about life and friendship and the\u000aevils inherent in human nature. You laugh with them, are sad with them\u000aand feel their pain, and in the end, when the two friends meet again on\u000aa remote beach years later, you finally break down and cry with them.This movie is emotionally powerful and reminds us once again what the\u000amovies should be.It is not sentimental in any way, and that is a rarity these days. And\u000aif you do not feel sad, and your heart does not beat faster with Morgan\u000aFreeman's soliloquoy at the end, you cannot call yourself human. For,\u000athen, you have missed one of the greatests gifts one can receive: a\u000apassion for life.\u000a

V\u000aI have seen this movie twice and I enjoyed it as much the second time\u000aas I did the first time. Of course the surprise-effect is gone the\u000asecond time because you know how the story goes, but that isn't a\u000aproblem. The story is brilliant: it's amazing how clever Andy is! The\u000aacting is outstanding. Morgan Freeman proves again he is a top-talent\u000aand also Tim Robbins is wonderful.The story has everything: it's very sensitive and it shows some aspects\u000aof prison that aren't shown in other prison movies. It think (but I'm\u000anot sure because I have never been in prison) it gives a unique, but\u000arealistic view on the prison life and the many feelings prisoners are\u000aconfronted with doing their time. The example of very tragic but so\u000atrue I think. The guy has been his whole life in prison, that's the\u000aonly life he knows and when he is released, he doesn't know how to\u000abuilt up a life in the real world because the world he know before\u000aprison doesn't exist anymore.Frank Darabont proves he is a remarkable director and that he is made\u000afor directing prison-movies. "The Green Mile" is also an excellent and\u000atouching prison drama. It almost unbelievable that "The Shawshank\u000aRedemption" didn't won any Academy Award. But of course you can't deny\u000athat fact that the competition was fierce that year with also "Forrest\u000aGump" in the running.Highly recommendable prison-drama with great acting performances by\u000aMorgan Freeman and Tim Robbins.9/10\u000a

V\u000aI hope you watch this film, and you are found better for it. This movie is all about acting in the best interest of yourself and\u000aothers, and the evil that checks our good motive. Morgan Freeman plays\u000athe role of a lifetime, and that's saying a lot because Morgan has had\u000aquite a few outstanding performances. I do think this was his best. The\u000areason I think that are the extremes that Freeman's character goes\u000athrough from utter despair ("somestimes all I can think about is ...")\u000ato highest hope.The movie does so many things well, but the two most important for me\u000awere Freeman's Narration as a whole ("tall drink of water") and the use\u000aof the letter device through narration. Freeman narrating the letter\u000awhich read,"I hope this letter finds you well," is one of the most\u000apleasant lines I think I have even heard in any movie. It had to make\u000aFreeman's character feel better about "his friend" (though he may not\u000ahave needed that), but it is as if Andy Dufresne knew that Red would be\u000astruggling, and he needed the feeling of calmness to get him through\u000athis period. The treasure hunt device and the physical scene of that\u000adevice is movie making at it's finest. The shot up the hill to the tree\u000a(great focal point), the stone wall, it was all perfect.I would that we all would find our friend on the beach of self content\u000afor fond embrace.\u000a

V\u000aThis movie is perfect in construction, with just the right amount of\u000afeel-goodiness added but not so much as to make one wretch. A portrait\u000aof the strength of the human spirit, and the awesome power of hope. I\u000alove the feeling of hope that this movie inspires in the viewer. I\u000ahaven't met anyone who doesn't love it (still awaiting the DVD's return\u000aas I lent it to a friend about 4 months ago!) The only negative comment\u000aI've ever heard about it is the ending. Some die-hards think the movie\u000ashould end with Red in the coach on his way to find Andy, but not show\u000atheir meeting on the beach as its too corny. I disagree. I think that\u000aafter the whole battle to escape, and wondering if they will etc,\u000apeople needed the closure that seeing them meet offered. If they'd\u000ahugged and cried that would have been too much for me, but it was done\u000aperfectly. With Red, casually strolling down the beach towards Andy and\u000astarting to laugh. I'm getting goose-bumps just thinking about it now.My favourite movie.\u000a

V\u000aOutstanding. Never has a film gripped so powerfully before. Some films\u000aare great and hold you well enough, but this absolute powerhouse of a\u000afilm keeps me glued, and is a great tribute to Hollywood, the great\u000aStephen King short story, and of course a great tribute to all the\u000athings that make hope and freedom so wonderful. Tim Robbins gives the\u000aperformance of his life, as Andy Dufresne. A strong-headed man who is\u000asent to Shawshank prison, wrongfully accused of "murdering his wife,\u000aand the fellow she was banging." With that in mind, it is\u000aexcruciatingly tense and powerful, as we watch Andy adapt to prison\u000alife, form a beautiful friendship with 'Red' the convict who knows how\u000ato get things, (played brilliantly by Morgan Freeman, who in my opinion\u000adeserved to win the Best Actor Oscar) and of course see him handle\u000ahimself around those out to get him, which spans from other prisoners\u000ato the warden, who he helps turn the prison into a business, due to his\u000agood experience as a banker, the occupation which he held before being\u000aconvicted. But as the picture goes on, you can see the yearning to get\u000aout. He is a bird that has been caged wrongfully, and when you see how\u000along he has been locked away for, even though he didn't do it it really\u000amakes for stunning and compelling viewing. The ending is beautifully\u000ascripted, and the mood is outstanding. Frank Darabont has created an\u000aexceptional film, with realistic talents and people we can care for.\u000aThe stereotype of the prisoner is made into something better, and the\u000aoverall experience of this film is magnificent, with fantastic\u000amemorable quotes, and an exchange of good to bad atmosphere, which at\u000aone point makes you feel good watching it, but then shows the awful\u000aatrocities and seriousness of the situation. This complex style of\u000adirection and storytelling is amazing, and the ending is top notch, I\u000awon't spoil this bit though. You wanna know how good it is? Then watch\u000ait and be dazzled by this truly remarkable film. 10/10\u000a

V\u000aA Prison Movie. An all-male cast (except for Rita Hayworth). Violence.\u000aA title guaranteed to sprain your jaw. When Shawshank hit theatres in\u000a1994, odds were decidedly against it becoming a huge success. It would\u000abe nice to think that an ultimately upbeat, earnest, modernist take on\u000athe films of Frank Capra would immediately find a sympathetic and\u000aappreciative audience. But that would be a fairy tale, and life, like\u000aprison, is no fairy tale.The film has the cheek to ask Which is worse, being a murderer, or\u000abeing a lousy husband? Certainly the audience must ask itself this of\u000athe main character, Andy, played by Tim Robbins, who is sent to\u000aShawshank Prison in 1947 for the murder of his wife and her lover.\u000aIntroverted, bookish, proud, his fate is uncertain until he attracts\u000athe attention of the prison "finder" Red, played by Morgan Freeman.\u000aTogether the two men must find emotional healing, spiritual redemption,\u000aand hope, if they are to survive.Adroit and expertly manipulative, the film's pace is dictated by the\u000adeathless narration of Freeman, who could hold an audience spellbound\u000awhile reciting phone book listings; or, suspend utter disbelief at a\u000apatently preposterous storyline. Nor are characterizations any less\u000apreposterous, from the sociopathic Warden, to the sadistic Head Guard,\u000ato the grandfatherly Librarian, to the manic-youthful Young Punk. But\u000aif the characters seem too archetypal to be true, it is a necessary,\u000aand tolerable evil in this fairy-tale set in a prison.As I said, life is no fairy-tale, and prison movies rarely get to\u000atop-ten status. But sometimes some good does prevail, and redemption\u000aoften stands in wait for those who dare reach out to it. As a first-run\u000acinematic release Shawshank was not a great success. But as a\u000acommercial video, the film has achieved high status, and is voted year\u000aafter year as a top consumer favorite. Cinematically near-perfect,\u000avisually breathtaking, Shawshank is a state-of-the-art example of the\u000apower of film to tell stories, and is rightly considered a must-see by\u000amost film reviewers.\u000a

V\u000aOne night when i was browsing through the channels and my dad was doing\u000alaundry. The Shawshank Redemption came up and he said it was one of his\u000afavorite films. I had no idea why until i watched it. The movies\u000aperformances, specifically Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman, are both\u000aincredibly complex and are both Oscar quality. The set of the prison\u000aand supporting cast and extras are all masterfully organized. The story\u000ais crisp and original, and has deep emotion to it. This movie received\u000a7 Oscar nominations and won none, i believe because Forrest Gump stole\u000aall the thunder. But if it were my choice, The Shawshank Redemption\u000awould have won Best Picture and is in my mind the best film i have ever\u000aseen.\u000a

V\u000aAwe-inspiring...an amazing emotional journey and a great philosophical\u000apiece. A true work of art. But where do I start? The casting is\u000aexcellent, the characters all mesh seamlessly and effortlessly into the\u000astoryline and the interactions seem real and believable throughout. The\u000aphilosophical connotations that the movie brings with it are thought\u000aprovoking; showing the shades of society, not as blacks and whites (as\u000ain good and bad, not as race) but as shades of grey. The reversal of\u000aexpected integrity of character comparing the guards and the inmates is\u000aexcellent and adds depth to the story and something to think about. It\u000ashows the good and evil that exist on 'both sides of the fence' so to\u000aspeak. The imagery and visual artistry throughout the entire film is\u000adone flawlessly. The drab neutral colours (yes colours... I'm Canadian)\u000aof the prison itself and the clothing of both the guards and the\u000ainmates set the stage for the dreary and sometimes dark undertones for\u000athe story quite well. I am not old enough to know whether the type of\u000aweapons, outfits, vehicles etc. used as props in the movie are accurate\u000abut they seemed to be in my eyes and fit the time period. I could go on\u000abut words alone do not do the movie justice, you have to go see it.\u000a

V\u000aBest movie ever made. From the beginning to the end this movie is so\u000aperfect it's hard to put it into words, every little detail is\u000astunning. Maybe my opinion is not the most objective because this has\u000abeen my favorite movie for quite some time, but however, I remembered\u000athe first time I saw it. I could't get it of my mind for a couple of\u000adays. And still, after seeing it over 20 times, I often think about it\u000aand smile. The part when Andy escapes and the next 30 minutes after\u000athat you can't stop smiling, it's so perfect. The biggest star must go\u000ato Morgan Freeman who gives this movie even more deep and feeling. To\u000aeveryone who haven't seen it yet, do it, you will not regret it.\u000a

V\u000aMust see, please do not read the reviews on this movie until you have\u000aseen it, you would repent your decision if you came to know the story.So much detailed, full of suspense - yet nobody could guess what (the\u000ahell) was going on! The poster, small hammer (or whatever), the book\u000akeeping - and above all the HOPE - I am so much impressed by this film.\u000aIt never looked like a movie of such a fantastic end. Well, one could\u000aguess that Andy (Tim) might not have murdered his wife, but it was\u000adifficult to imagine the depth in story. I am inclined to read the\u000anovel now. Would you believe, this movie was recommended by the DVD\u000ashop owner, who I thought was interested only in the hit (read\u000awell-known) movies.\u000a

V\u000aLike many people I didn't bother seeing this movie when it was in\u000atheaters, and then I forgot about it, it wasn't till many years later\u000athat I decided to give this movie a chance.After reading all the praises for this movie I decided to rent it. The\u000afirst time I watched it I fell asleep, I was bored out of my mind. A\u000acouple of months past I decided to give it a second chance and watched\u000ait all the way through and thought, what was so great about that movie,\u000anothing special. Another couple of months pass and I spot the 10th\u000aanniversary ed. for sale, so I bought it because I liked the artwork on\u000athe cover. I saw it for the third time and I fell in love with it. It's\u000adefinitely one of my favorite movies of all time.Why the academy didn't award this masterpiece an award is beyond me.\u000aThe directing is perfect, it's perfectly casted and acted, every actor\u000ais believable in their roles, the story, adapted from a short story by\u000aSteven king is what stands out. This is the ultimate movie about hope;\u000anever give up hope no matter what.I've noticed many people bashing this movie, I say just give it a\u000achance, I thought it was crap on my first viewing; it wasn't until my\u000athird viewing that I realized how incredible this movie was.This movie changed my life. Whenever I'm going through a hard time in\u000amy life, I pop in this movie and realize that no matter what you're\u000agoing through, you can come out clean on the other side.\u000a

V\u000aWhen Andy Dufresne, a young and successful banker, discovers his wife\u000ain bed with another man his life takes a dramatic turn for the worse.\u000aWhen the lovers' bodies are discovered, shot repeatedly with bullets\u000afrom a gun linked to Andy, he becomes wrongly imprisoned. Sent to a\u000amaximum security prison run by a corrupt and over-zealous religious\u000awarden he struggles to hang on to hope of returning to the outside\u000aworld and reclaiming a sense of normality. After a period of isolation\u000ahe finally approaches one of the other inmates, a convict called Red\u000awho is the only person in Shawshank Prison guilty of their crime. What\u000abegins as a business partnership between two characters, who would be\u000aunlikely to cross paths in the real world, quickly turns into a\u000alifelong friendship. Together they manage to fight impossible odds to\u000asurvive and prove that both hope and the possibility for redemption\u000anever die.I have heard many people rave about 'The Shawshank Redemption' over the\u000ayears but have only just gotten around to watching it myself, and the\u000apraise heaped upon this film scarcely do it justice. This is not just\u000athe story of a man wrongly imprisoned, or the astonishing reality of\u000alife behind bars, but an emotional drama which reels you in from the\u000aonset. The movie is quite lengthy however I found myself unable to\u000apress the stop button as the level of interest was maintained steadily\u000athroughout, and I kept wanting to "watch a bit more". It has been a\u000along time since I have actually cried while watching a film or sat on\u000athe edge of my seat literally in suspense, but 'The Shawshank\u000aRedemption' managed to make me do both.The characters are what make this movie brilliant and the casting of\u000aMorgan Freeman as Red and Tim Robbins as Andy was spot on. They managed\u000ato convince me that I was watching real life and actual circumstances\u000arather than just a realistic portrayal of the prison world. Their\u000areactions and behaviour were original but suited the film, and really\u000ahighlighted how easy it can be to become a victim but that you do not\u000ahave to accept that role forever.I felt inspired by the ideas raised and loved how my mind was\u000aencouraged to consider certain beliefs and rules in society. This movie\u000achallenges some of the toughest issues facing us in the modern age,\u000aeven though the film was set over a period from the 1940's  1980's.\u000aFrank Darabont has produced an excellent movie which does not\u000adisappoint in any way. I would recommend 'The Shawshank Redemption' to\u000aanyone over the age of about 15 as a brilliant and enlightening drama.\u000a

V\u000aI bought this film just due to its high score on IMDb. I was not\u000adisappointed. My comment to my wife after seeing this, was "nothing\u000aactually happened, but I could still not take my eyes from the screen".\u000aThis movie works like emotional magic to a guy who normally swears to\u000aaction, horror and FX movies. Hats off to the actors, the script writer\u000aand the director.And no hats off to the IMDb people who make me write 10 lines. I don't\u000acare if I'm banned from writing more reviews by adding these final\u000ameaningless lines. I've used IMDb since it was born, and this is the\u000afirst time I've actually felt like telling the world a movie is worth\u000awatching. It's probably also the last time, so just ban me from\u000acommenting further.\u000a

V\u000aHaving to compete that year with such films as Forrest Gump(Also\u000aExcellent), Quiz Show(Brilliant) and Pulp Fiction(Disturbing yet a\u000akiller) Many people have shadowed this film that delivers important\u000amorals and mixed emotions. The film has a dark side to but the\u000anarration calms it side down. The film is feel good because you feel\u000athat justice has been served every time Andy has had his way. It is sad\u000abecause you realize how heartless the staff of the prison is. Morgan\u000aFreeman delivers an absolutely impressive performance as a jail bird\u000aand so does Tim Robbins who plays a shy "fish" who evolves into an\u000aimportant jail man. They pull off the roles brilliantly. I did not even\u000aimagine a film like this was possible. If you have not seen this movie\u000ayet rent as soon as you can. I have never met a person who has not\u000aenjoyed The Shawshank Redemption. The Narration plays a big part in why\u000athe movie is liked by myself and many others. Goodfellas, Dances With\u000aWolves, Forrest Gump also carried brilliant narration but Morgan\u000aFreeman's warm voice seems to beat all the others. The Shawshank\u000aRedemption is the most well written picture I have ever seen because it\u000adepicts the prisoners not as groups but as families, not as criminals\u000abut as victims and deserved more hype then it received.It's just brilliant: the film, narration and actors\u000a

V\u000aI like this movie for the following reasons. first its screen play is\u000aperfect. The hero acted in a correct fashion. He lived the character.\u000aThrough out the movie he displays a balanced mind. I like the movie\u000abecause it talks about hope and how hope will bring happiness. I always\u000aused to think about it when ever I lose hope in doing some work or in\u000asolving my own problems. The two characters Hero and his friend were\u000ashown of opposite in nature. Hero always talks about hope and his\u000afriend talks opposite to hope. This makes me feel what really life will\u000abe without hope and with hope. One more thing It teaches is It does not\u000amatter where we are but what we do.\u000a

V\u000aIf you were to explain why this film is so good by simply explaining\u000athe plot there is no way that you could do this film justice.This is\u000abecause the plot is simple as it's a story of two friends developing a\u000afriendship while they are in prison.However by keeping the plot simple\u000ayou are really given a chance to connect with the two main characters\u000aAndy and red and can feel a great sense of empathy towards them\u000aboth.However the real high point of the film is the ending which seems\u000aas rewarding an ending as any film i have ever seen.After watching the\u000afilm it really does give a sense of happiness and hope.It is a simply\u000asuperb film and my favourite movie ever.\u000a

V\u000aAfter watching this movie, you come to think about how important and\u000avaluable your freedom really is.I think everyone should watch this movie. The story is very well shown\u000aand played, the actors were amazing and I didn't see any failure except\u000athat eventually, the end goes by really fast, but maybe it's better\u000alike this, when the happy things aren't described, your imagination can\u000amake the most wonderful story out of it.On the not so good series, I'd point the captain of the guards, who\u000aseemed to have some good feelings at some moments of the movie, and who\u000aended killing the young guy in such a pitiful and disappointing way.\u000aAlso the director of Shawshank died without getting what he should have\u000areceive for being such a bastard, which was quite unfair.But well, the worst punishment you could get, is not physical, nor\u000amaterial, it's when you discover you ruined your life, and lost your\u000atime.I gave this movie a 9, because nobody and nothing is perfect.I can guarantee that you won't regret watching this, even if it takes\u000aaway 2 hours of your free time, this movie could make you realize how\u000ato spend the remaining ones of your life in the most clever way.GO FREEDOM ! :-)\u000a

V\u000aThis movie is easily the best movie ever made. The plot is one that's\u000abeen told before but a completely different twist on how life in prison\u000ais one hard to leave once used to it. To quote Morgan Freeman\u000a(Red),"These walls are funny first you hate them, then you get used to\u000athem, and then you can't live without them." It's the story of Andy\u000aDufrain who killed his Wife and her lover and is put in jail for life.It's the story of how you go to prison for life and that is exactly\u000awhat they take from you. It shows the story of conspiracy and murder\u000aand always holds your attention. It is a long movie but not once do you\u000awant it to end. It's the story of friendship between Andy and Red and\u000ahow you should always keep your promises to your friends.The symbolism was phenomenal and a movie that once you finish it. You\u000awant to rewind it and watch it again. "Get busy livin, or get busy\u000adyin."\u000a

The commentaries from Tim Robbins, Morgan\u000aFreeman and others contribute so much more that i would recommend to\u000athe first time viewer, if there are any, to view these bonus tracks\u000aprior to the movie. The extras sell the film all over again. I continue\u000ato watch this film a couple of times a month. The film lifts my spirits\u000aand jump starts my soul.

V\u000aRarely has a director connected so well to the spirit of a story, and\u000awith the impeccable work of Morgan Freeman, whose narration is nothing\u000ashort of perfect, and Tim Robbins' everyman, "Shawshank" delivers an\u000aalmost perfect film. Frank Darabont has opened up the short story and\u000acreated a work that explores what lurks in the souls of people. He has\u000aadded details that allow us to understand how the human spirit manages\u000ato survive in the worst of conditions. He also shows us that beauty\u000alies in just about any place in this world.The film moves very well, taking us for a long and rewarding ride.\u000aCharacters age and evolve, discovering how their relationships with\u000aothers always have consequences. Tim Robbins remains at the center, and\u000ahe becomes, for most of the film, an observer, our representative in a\u000aworld that could destroy you if you let it.We relate to the men of "Shawshank" because they are our\u000arepresentatives in a microcosm of society. We observe as we participate\u000aand see our reflections in a mini study of emotions and mind games.\u000a

V\u000aThe Shawshank Redemption is without a doubt my favourite film of all\u000atime. Ranked 2 in the top 250 films it is clear others agree with me.\u000aAnd when you watch this you will too. The plot may sound familiar (guy\u000agoes to jail, guy escapes jail) but this is nothing like i have seen\u000abefore. It's about Andy Dufresnes (Tim Robbins) determination and\u000apersistence which keeps him going through his 19 years. But the film is\u000aalso about Ellis Boyd Redding (Morgan Freeman) commonly known as "Red".\u000aHe does not claim innocence and is the only guilty man in Shawkshank.\u000aWhen Dufresne arrives Red makes a bet he'd be first to crack. But Andy\u000astays strong which surprises Red. He uses this strength to keep going\u000aday after day and he passes this feeling onto Red when he tells him of\u000aa box planted under the tree. This gives Red some hope, It gives him\u000asomething to look forward to and that will keep him going day by day.\u000aWithout Andy Red would have nothing in life. And when you have nothing\u000ain life like Brooks did... There is nothing to keep you going onto the\u000anext day. This film is brilliantly scripted. The acting is top class\u000aand you get the feel of the innocent man amongst the guilty. The\u000acorrupt guards and wardens add to Andys story of wrong convictions and\u000aunfairly treated. He just happens to be the only innocent man in\u000aShawshank.\u000a

I\u000acannot tell anything about the movie, because I'll mess up the story\u000afor the ones that haven't seen the movie yet, but believe me, the twist\u000ain the end of the movie, it's just fascinating... The whole person of\u000aDufresne is fascinating, the calmth in his whole appearance, the way\u000ahe's living his life in jail, in one word fascinating.

Though I have never been a Stephen King fan, this is one story\u000awhich makes him deserve accolades over and over again. When I was\u000awatching the movie, halfway through it, I admit I was bored. And when\u000aTommy (Gil Bellows) was shot, I was like "Who the hell recommended me\u000athis movie??". But still I just wanted to get this movie over with, so\u000aI watched further. And when that scene comes where the warden throws a\u000apebble at the poster and it tears right through!!! My God!!! My mouth\u000awas agape the whole time!!! What a fantastic ending!. The movie indeed\u000ahas the best finale in cinematic history.(The Usual Suspects comes a\u000aclose second..). Performances were superb.. (..I still think Tim\u000aRobbins deserved a nomination more than Morgan Freeman..). The wardens\u000awere damn good as the tormentors. But overall, I believe the story\u000aitself deserves a special place in the annals of great cinema!!!\u000a

V\u000aBrilliance. Total Brilliance. From the perfectly casted roles, to the haunting music; the\u000aall-encompassing narrative provided by Morgan Freeman, to the\u000amagnificent storyline and plot, this movie blends all these elements of\u000agood film-making. So much so, that even something as commonly\u000aoverlooked as having just enough comedy to provide relief from total\u000asomberness, but not enough to distract from the misery of prison life\u000abrought by the equally criminal actions of those in authority at the\u000aprison; this, too, was executed with perfection. This movie is the blueprint for what I would consider to be the perfect\u000amovie. I challenge anyone to come up with something they would "do\u000abetter" than what those who made this movie did.\u000a

V\u000aThe Shawshank Redemption is not just a movie, it's a phenomena, it's a\u000aone of kind and that's for sure.The man who wrote such a story is a genius, and of course the director\u000awho used the story perfectly to make such a movie, and the actors "Tim\u000aRobbins" and "Morgan Freeman" made such a perfect role specially "Tim\u000aRobbins" because "Morgan Freeman" never made a bad role ever, but "Tim\u000aRobbins" didn't make great roles in many movies so his role in this\u000amovie is spectacular.One of the best scenes in the movie is the one when the prison manager\u000atook his bible and was about to leave and then remembered and gave him\u000athe bible saying "Salvation is within", not knowing that if he opened\u000athe bible he will find the tool "Robbins" used to dig!! And in the end\u000a"Robbins" leave the bible with a small note saying "You were right,\u000asalvation is within"!! Amazing.\u000a

V\u000aHonestly, whenever you think of a good movie, what's the first thing\u000athat comes to mind when you think about it? Is it the story? The\u000acharacters? The setting? How about the acting? The writing? Or, most\u000aimportantly in some cases, the directing? Did the movie go in the\u000adirection that it needed to go?Some, if not all people think of at least one of these things. Some\u000athink about it all, and judge the movie by how well it held up under\u000aall of these matters it had to worry about.I'm one of the latter. And I think that not only is "The Shawshank\u000aRedemption" the greatest adaptation of a story ever, it quite possibly\u000amight be the greatest film, ever. And if it isn't, it's damn close.Seriously, seeing that "Shawshank" is at #2 on the all time 250 is, at\u000aleast to me, a testament to how under-rated and under-appreciated it\u000areally is. Now, don't get me wrong... being the second greatest film\u000aever is quite an honor, and any film lucky enough to receive it must be\u000apretty damn good anyway. But seeing it in second place just reminds me\u000aof the 1995 Academy awards. This movie was nominated for 7 awards, and\u000ado you know how many it went home with? 0. In a just world, it would\u000ahave swept.But I'm being a little too bias, so let's just get on with the movie,\u000aeh?Anyways, the movie takes place in the late 1940's and is about a man\u000anamed Andy Dufresne (Tim Robbins, in the absolute finest performance of\u000ahis entire career) who, in the very beginning of the film, is convicted\u000aof murdering his wife and her lover. Of course, we know he isn't\u000aguilty, but either way, he's sent to live out two life sentences at\u000aShawshank, one of the toughest prisons in the world. Meanwhile, Red\u000a(Morgan Freeman, also in his finest performance) is denied parole\u000aagain, after serving 20 years of a life sentence.It should be known to most of you that this movie is entirely based off\u000aof a 90 page short story by Stephen King called "Rita Hayworth and\u000aShawshank Redemption", which was featured in one of his collections.\u000aThe book is entirely made up of Red's passages, which means that in the\u000amovie he's going to become the narrator. Normally, this would become\u000aintrusive, but here, it shines. It's also important to point out that\u000athere is an entire scene in the movie that was never in the book, where\u000aAndy rebels and plays music over the intercom for the entire prison to\u000ahear. This not only shows a powerful thing called "hope", it shows just\u000ahow talented Frank Darabont really is. After all, he's responsible for\u000aanother underrated gem "The Green Mile".But back to the story. Andy arrives at the prison, and after a very\u000acrappy first night in which he didn't make a sound, he finally meets\u000aRed, and they become very good friends while he's there for 20 years.\u000aWe see him struggle, get abused by the "sisters", build a library, do\u000aaccounting because his life on the outside was that of an accountant\u000aand many other things. One of the most powerful scenes of the film is\u000awhen he is put in the hole for 2 months because he snooped around too\u000amuch with the warden (Bob Gunton, in his usual asshole role) about the\u000aperson who really killed his wife.Top that off with amazingly good co-star performances by William\u000aAtherton and Clancy Brown, and it can't be beat.Anyways, yeah, I'm not saying anything else except that this is truly\u000adeserving of the best film honors here, and I'd like to see it.An honest to god amazing film.\u000a

V\u000aThis for me is the best movie of all time because it shows\u000acompanionship through out the movie between the two main characters\u000a(andy and red). It's true to life with the little details of when it\u000awas set and the story was genius, great twist at the end when he\u000areveals the hole in the wall, great stuff, your rooting for Andy the\u000awhole time as we all know he is innocent. He gets his revenge in the\u000aend by out smarting the person who over looks the prison, which for me\u000ais the best part of the movie. The three sister also shine a light on\u000ahow desperate in mates can get, and Red shows the craft of an\u000aexperienced prisoner smuggling small goods for the rest, he takes Andy\u000aunder his wing and tells him moral after moral. Great movie, i can watch it over and over again, which, normally i cant\u000awith most long movies, but this is one movie that is something that\u000alittle extra special. Watch it!!!!\u000a

V\u000aThis is simply a film that you would struggle to find a flaw with. The\u000aperformances are wonderful, the story is involving and deep, the\u000acharacters are likable and understandable, and the whole climax to the\u000astory is satisfying and rewards you for having stayed the course. It's\u000afunny, it's moving, and it presents an incredible perception on the\u000aideas of hope, freedom and the vibrancy of the human spirit.If you haven't seen this film yet, then go out, rent a copy, and watch\u000ait. If you have a friend who hasn't seen it either, then invite them\u000around - believe me, they'll thank you for it. This is one film that\u000areally is a must-see.\u000a

V\u000aIn the 11 years since the release and realization of the brilliance of\u000athis film, I'm sure many, many legions of people have written reviews\u000athat summarily praise (and viscously, ignorantly degrade - you know who\u000ayou are, those whose reviews appear under the "hated" tag on the\u000areviews pages) and criticize the movie. I can't add anything that\u000ahasn't been said before, except just say how much this movie affected\u000ame and how much I love it. Tim Robbins, always a great actor, and always very, very human. Morgan\u000aFreeman, c'mon, who da man? Who da MAN?!?!? HE DA MAN!!! He DA MAN!!!\u000aHe DA smooth-walkin', smoother-talking', illest muthaf***in' epitome of\u000a"cool". And not a bad actor, either, heh heh (yes, I know I am\u000adrastically understating that fact). The direction - flawless. Every shot, every camera angle, every color\u000atone (plus the quality of the film and the cameras themselves) embody\u000asuch finesse, such power. Humanity! That's what the word I was looking\u000afor, the word that describes what every frame overwhelmingly emanates,\u000aeven during the "brutal" scenes (I put "brutal" in quotes because I\u000aunfortunately have seen plenty of sick s@%* in my life and am now sadly\u000adesensitized to movie violence; violence on the news and in real life\u000athough, DAMN I get sickened and angered at perpetrators). The very\u000ahuman friendship twixt the leads are very well handled, never turning\u000ainto cutesy schmaltz or soap-y melodrama. The writing. Yes, I know. "How the hell does his cell open up into a\u000apipe drain? That's horrible plot!!!!!!" Ask yourselves: If his cell\u000awall didn't open up over the pipe, would he have escaped? Would the\u000astory have been the same AT ALL if his cell opened up anywhere else\u000aother than that river of s@%*? And then think about Andy. Would someone\u000aof his intelligence would have discontinued his digging and succumbed\u000ato madness if what he saw when he looked through the initial tiny hole\u000aon the other side was anything other than a road to freedom? Convenient\u000aplot twist? Sure! But not outlandish. It could happen (not like a New\u000aYork Cop winning a $4M lottery ticket and tipping a waitress half, no\u000amatter how much he wanted to get with her). Very good storytelling and\u000avery tight screen writing. This movie is great. Plain and simple. It did confirm one thing in\u000ageneral to me, though, especially in these times of moral conflict that\u000ais dividing the "greatest nation on the face of the earth" bitterly:\u000aThose who thump the bible the hardest, usually cling to it the hardest\u000aout of fear and out of guilt. Love this film.\u000a

V\u000aWhen Portland banker Andy Dufresne (Tim Robbins) is unjustly convicted\u000aof murder and sent to prison, he quickly learns that life on the inside\u000ais harsh and unforgiving. Thankfully, he also forges a powerful\u000afriendship with Red (Morgan Freeman) a fellow lifer who learns to\u000aappreciate Andy's spirit and determination. Later, when Andy set's\u000ahimself up as the resident financial adviser to the warden and guards,\u000ahe manages to earn an odd form of respect from all he comes in contact\u000awith. Based on the Stephen King novella "Rita Hayworth and the\u000aShawshank Redemption", it is story about friendship, hope and the\u000atriumph of the human spirit over incredible hardship. Hows that for a clichéd synopsis? This may summarize what the film is\u000aabout, but it does not explain why this film resonates so much with\u000aaudiences worldwide. Now, I remember the first time I read this short story by Stephen King.\u000aI opened up "Different Seasons" because I wanted to read "The Body",\u000athe novella which is the basis for "Stand By Me". After I had finished\u000athat one I saw this oddly titled story at the beginning of the\u000aanthology. I started reading it and did not stop till later that day,\u000awhen, with tears in my eyes, I put the book down. My first thought was\u000a"that was a great story!" and I was amazed that King could write\u000asomething so inspirational. Then I thought to myself "that would make a\u000agreat picture".A year or so later - this film was released, and I went to the theater\u000awith high hopes. The memories of this story were still cemented in my\u000aimagination (I had actually pictured William Sadler as Red when I read\u000athe book) and I was not disappointed by what I saw. In fact, If\u000aanything I was even more impressed with the film because Darabont\u000amanaged to capture the nuance and feel of the original story so\u000aperfectly. The look and feel of the prison and the characterizations of\u000aRed and Andy where inspired. Nobody carries the regal dignity and\u000awisdom of Red like Morgan Freeman, and Tim Robbins was perfectly\u000aenigmatic as Dufresne. Add to that Thomas Newmans stoic and moving\u000ascore, and what I saw was nothing short of movie magic. I walked out of\u000athe theater, my heart soaring and knowing I had just watched a great\u000apicture. I have only felt that way a few times before or since ("Field\u000aof Dreams" and "Dances With Wolves" are two good examples) and I still\u000aget that feeling when I watch it at home.This is more than a prison escape movie - it is, to me, a film about\u000athe friendship between Red and Andy. I think so many men are fans of\u000athis picture because Andy and Red have a connection that we would all\u000alike to have with our friends, and that only a few of us are fortunate\u000aenough to share or experience. I went to a marriage retreat recently,\u000aand when the men and women were split up and asked to describe their\u000alikes and dislikes, the question of movies came up. I think it is\u000ainteresting to note that all of us men listed this film as one of our\u000atop ten.King has a way of writing language that is both common and lyrical at\u000athe same time, and his characters have a wisdom and moral certainty\u000athat connects with the reader. Kings skill as a writer is especially\u000aevident in this picture with Freemans' narration. A lot of the lines\u000awhich he spoke are direct from the book, and this is a testament to\u000aDarabont's respect for that written word. The screenplay he wrote was\u000amore than just a faithful adaptation - it is an homage to the wonderful\u000astory King wrote.I have read a lot of reviews and comments on this site that refer to\u000athis film as "over-hyped" and "cliched", and to some extent this may be\u000atrue. This movie doesn't have a plot thats overly complicated, and the\u000acharacters (specifically the warden and prison guards) may be slightly\u000atwo-dimensional - but I think that was done on purpose. I believe\u000aStephen King wrote this story as an example of how a simple concept\u000alike "hope" can pull someone through a very difficult time - and it is\u000athis idea that appeals to so many people. This movie doesn't make any\u000asocial commentary, and it is certainly not PC - which is refreshing.\u000aToo many films today are nothing more than political soapboxes for the\u000afilm-maker, and unfortunately the cynics and idealists prefer that sort\u000aof commentary to simple story-telling. It has been said by fans of this movie, that "It's a Wonderful Life"\u000awas pooh-poohed by critics when it was released as sentimental tripe -\u000aand if the same film had been made today, it would be similarly scoffed\u000aand mocked with abandon for it's old-fashioned sensibilities. Now,\u000apeople look at it as a classic, and rightly so, because it has a simple\u000amessage that people love to hear, over and over. That's what "The\u000aShawshank Redemption" is like. It's just a great story about friendship\u000athat is told well, and most people appreciate that and that is why its\u000aone of the top ten films on this website."Get busy living, or get busy dying."\u000a

V\u000aWell, first I must admit i am no fan of drama movie cause they tend to\u000abe slow and uninteresting, but the ones i do love are just great movies\u000athat makes me either smile or break a tear. This movie is definitely\u000athe latter.Tim Robbins and Freeman makes some powerful acting which is top notch,\u000abut what makes this movie so special except the incredible story, is\u000athat everyone perform at their best. Really hard to point out an actor\u000awho only had an average performance. Not many movies that gives so many\u000acolorful performances from all involved.The story is really a masterpiece but to put it out so well in a movie\u000ais even harder. And the twists are surprising but makes it even better.\u000aShows how harsh prison life was in the 40's and 50's but even though\u000ayou are given a glimpse of the though conditions there is always that\u000asense of upbeat aura in the characters and u can't help but smile on a\u000afew occasions even though there might not be much to smile about. There\u000ais so much u can say about this movie but I just say this, this is as\u000agood as drama gets.\u000a

V\u000a"Andy Dufresne - who crawled through a river of s@#t and came out clean\u000aon the other side." Fantastic story line. Tim Robbins and Morgan\u000aFreeman are mesmerizing as "Andy Dufresne" and "Red" respectively. As\u000aare "Warden Norton" and Clancy Brown("Capt. Hadley). Excellent\u000acharacterizations throughout the film make you feel what it's like to\u000abe wrongly imprisoned and the sense of hopelessness. The director is\u000adeft with the story twists and turns. Original and unique camera angles\u000agive you a real feel for "being there"...in that oppressive Maine state\u000aprison. The cinematography and the musical score are expansive and\u000alush. Countless great lines. "I find I'm so excited, I can barely sit still\u000aor hold a thought in my head. I think it the excitement only a free man\u000acan feel, a free man at the start of a long journey whose conclusion is\u000auncertain. I hope I can make it across the border. I hope to see my\u000afriend, and shake his hand. I hope the Pacific is as blue as it has\u000abeen in my dreams. I hope." - Red "Geology is the study of pressure and time. Thats all it takes\u000areally... pressure... and time... That, and a big god@#$n poster." "Fear can hold you prisoner. Hope can set you free." - Ad Poster for\u000athis movie.A true original. I have seen these movie many times and it never gets\u000aold. "Get busy living or get busy dying"...\u000a

V\u000aOnce in a while a great movie is made. In 1994, Shawshank Redemption,\u000awent up against another giant, Forrest Gump. I personally feel if it\u000aweren't for the fan appeal in that year; Shawshank would of taken best\u000apicture. If it were to go up against any movie ever created then it\u000awould easily win. Shawshank includes many twists and is depicted in a\u000avery graphic and realistic way. Once again (like all good movies) the\u000aending is what makes this movie. The actors were awesome and quite\u000apossibly could be the movie of the century. I really can't put this\u000amovie up against any other movie and should be #1 on the top 250 list.\u000aSo please vote 10 because this movie really deserves it.\u000a

V\u000aAfter seeing The Shawshank Redemption on television, I knew I had to\u000asee the whole film. It was incredible. After that I decided to read the\u000abook, and this is one of the rare times that a film outdid the book it\u000awas based off of. Even though the ending of the book was the same\u000a(poster, escape), the film just had a certain something to it that made\u000ait amazing. Tim Robbins ad Andy is extremely captivating and he almost\u000aentirely becomes the roll of a nobody. Not just any actor can do that.\u000aI can watch this movie time and time again and to me it will never get\u000aold. The music, dialouge, acting, and plot are award-deserving parts of\u000aa film that should go down in history as a classic.\u000a

V\u000aAn absolutely mind-blowing film about hope being with you no matter\u000awhat the situation may be.Just because the movie is about the prison\u000alife,you may be fooled into thinking that it is about the horrors and\u000athe fear and the hopelessness of the life.But it is in fact exactly the\u000aopposite of that.This is a film that tells us that no matter what the\u000asituation may be,no matter what happens,there is always hope left with\u000ayou and it is something which no one can take from you.It is a film that defines originality and perfection at that.Even\u000athough Andy Dufresne(Tim Robbins) was given life sentence,it was his\u000abelief that he is innocent that kept him from breaking down.It was hope\u000athat finally saved him."In prison,most people would do just about anything to keep themselves\u000abusy.Some made house of cards.some collected stamps.Andy built a\u000alibrary."These were the words of Red(Morgan Freeman).What he said was\u000atrue.Among all the movies I've seen,i truly believe that this is the best\u000aone out of all of them.So if any one of you have'nt seen this film,go\u000awatch it and be utterly amazed at it's perfection and storyline.\u000a

V\u000aTo be fair, I also have to admit that I am a big fan of Stephen King\u000aand the screenplay was so honest to the story so there's probably that\u000aextra appreciation personally. I just read another review and I felt\u000aobligated to agree! There really aren't words to describe this movie.\u000aIt gets better and better every time I see it and it doesn't matter\u000awhere I start. I have seen it at least five times every year since\u000a2000. It has to be my all-time favorite, hands down. The movies are the\u000aultimate escapism for me and this movie does just that, yet it depicts\u000asomething that we know too well, being a victim of circumstance or a\u000awitness of circumstances. Andy is the victim and Red is the witness,\u000aconnecting in a way where you had to be there to understand. Kudos too\u000ato Stephen King for always knowing exactly how to capture our worst\u000afears and materializing it. Whether it's the harsh punishment for a\u000acrime one did not commit or realizing that you've been so\u000a"institutionalized" by the very walls you hated that you no longer know\u000ahow to live without it, this movie exudes a sense of hope much welcomed\u000ato many.And though some of us may not absolutely believe in it, we are\u000anonetheless glad it's lingering just close enough for us to know it's\u000athere. It's such a well done piece, please go see it.\u000a

V\u000aStarring: Tim Robbins, Morgan Freeman There are some movies that when\u000ayou watch them you can't help but feel you've done more than watch a\u000amovie. Sometimes it feels like you've been part of something bigger,\u000alike you witnessed a masterpiece. The Shawshank Redemption is like\u000awatching poetry. It is one of the most tragic, heartfelt, and deeply\u000asatisfying stories to have ever been put onto the big screen. There\u000areally is a reason that this movie is number two on the internet movie\u000adatabase's top movies of all time.The premise of the movie is fairly simple. Andy Dufraine (Robbins) is\u000awrongfully accused with the murder of his wife and her lover, and he is\u000asentenced to two life sentences to be served back to back at Shawshank\u000aprison. The plot is simple, and yet at the same time deeply complex.\u000aThis movie is a celebration of the human spirit, a celebration of hope\u000aand of freedom.Life is difficult for Andy right from the beginning of his life\u000asentence. It takes him at least a month before he goes and talks to\u000aanyone. The first person he does talk to is Red (Freeman), a man in the\u000aprison who is able to get things. Need to get a pack of cigarettes, a\u000atoothbrush, maybe some playing cards, then Red is your man on the\u000ainside. Andy asks Red to pick up a rock hammer so that he can carve\u000astones.This movie is anything but a fairy tale. It depicts prison life as\u000abeing cruel, unfair, bitter, and downright horrible. Decent people die,\u000apeople get gang raped, the guards beat the ever-loving daylights out of\u000aanyone who steps out of line. Shawshank prison is one hard place to\u000aserve your time.After being in prison for a couple years, Andy gets transferred from\u000alaundry duty to library, mainly so the warden can send his men over to\u000aget financial advice from Andy. Andy starts doing income tax for the\u000aguards and the warden, setting up trust funds, and various other\u000afinancial services, and after a few years, he becomes the man who\u000alaunders the warden's dirty money. Sure, he got transferred to the\u000alibrary, but the only difference is he's washing money and not sheets\u000aand clothes.Andy takes up all sorts of projects while he's in Shawshank. He makes\u000achess pieces for a chess board, he makes it his personal task to obtain\u000afunds for and build a new prison library. He helps several of the\u000ainmates get their high school equivalence. He does whatever he can to\u000apass the time and keep himself a little bit sane.I'd hate to spoil the ending for anybody who hasn't seen this movie, so\u000aI will be very vague. All I will say is that it is one of the most\u000asatisfying and beautiful endings to any movie or story that has ever\u000abeen captured. This movie is a masterpiece, and you would do yourself a\u000afavour to make sure you watch it. And if you've already seen it, watch\u000ait again, and introduce somebody else to the world of Shawshank prison.Bottom Line: 4 out of 4 (own this movie)\u000a

V\u000aEasier one of the greatest films not to win an Oscar for best film, a\u000atruly great film. Moegan Freeman was finally awarded his long overdrew\u000aOscar in 2005. He was not far off receiving an Oscar for his stand out\u000arole as the inmate who befriends Tim Robbens character. I think it was\u000aForrest Gump that it lost out to in 1994 when it went up for the Oscar.\u000aAnd to lose out to such a film in its own right is not something to be\u000alooked shamefully on. Had it gone up in the same catorgory since then\u000ait would have more have likely have won. You would be hard pressed\u000afinding a film that has been given more complements that this, but has\u000anever received the recognition it mot truly deserves\u000a

V\u000aSimply put, this is more than a movie. Sit down in the dark one night\u000aand rediscover the magic of opening up the little tin box under the old\u000aoak tree. Listen to the sounds of the lady's from Italy as they send\u000ayou on a journey of musical bliss. Go numb once more as the arm goes\u000athrough the wall and you learn that 'ol Andy had some business on the\u000aside that even Red wasn't aware of. And lastly, see first hand on\u000ascreen how two men can have a friendship that knows only the limits\u000athat they have been confident enough to set-up for themselves. Yes,\u000athis is more than a movie. No doubt about it. For what it is, it's as\u000aperfect as a movie can be. So start livin' and smell the salt from the\u000awarm ocean blue.\u000a

V\u000aVery good movie that tells a good story.Life in early 1900's prison builds some strong friendships among the\u000ainmates. Daily prison existence takes its toll on you so you do what\u000ayou have to in order to make it through. Inmates learn how to make the\u000acorruption work in their favor and take full advantage of it by\u000abuilding on the trust the guards have in the inmates.I don't think they could have come up with a better ending to the story\u000athan what they did. This movie is a masterpiece that you will find\u000ayourself watching any time you are in the mood for a good movie.Highly recommended film. Watch it, you will be pleased.\u000a

V\u000aA true masterpiece, have seen the film many times and yet every time it\u000agets better for me.. thats a true sign of a great film.its not all about the prison break, so people getting this film to see\u000aan Escape from Alcatraz movie will be disappointed.This film is about hope and so much more. Awesome acting, great\u000asoundtrack, and even better story thats unfolded in such a great way. I\u000awish more movies would be like this.Get busy living or get busy dieing.this should be number #1 on IMDb, if you haven't seen it yet your\u000amissing a true classic\u000a

V\u000aI won't say i am a movie geek, but this movie is really nice. I like it\u000aby heart. A beautiful story and stunning performance by Tim Robbins.\u000aEverybody has to watch it one time. I always like Morgen Freeman. He\u000aperformed really well in this movie. The way of presentation is really\u000amind boggling. I was stunned for time being after watching this movie.\u000aIt is good movie to charge you up. It will make you feel that nothing\u000ais impossible. Dream has biggest power in world. And everybody should\u000afollow their dreams. Keep the HOPE alive always. Only dreaming is\u000adifferent thing but following that dream is really. Like i just wanted\u000ato write few lines but now i have to write more to send this review. I\u000aam not finding words to write. but any how i will finish this. I\u000astarted watching this movie at 11:00 PM and my one assignment is due\u000anext morning. i was doing that assignment and my friend brought this\u000amovie. I started watching it. I was so engrossed in this movie i could\u000anot have track of time. I finished this movie at 2:00 AM. Now i am\u000awriting this review and then i will start my assignment and i have a\u000aclass today 8:00 AM. So i think you can guess how good this movie is.\u000a

V\u000aWhis is quite simply one of the finest motion pictures ever made. The\u000amost surprising thing is that it comes from one of the most unlikely of\u000asources, Stephen King. I have never been a fan of his horror work and\u000adoubt I ever will be but his serious side has proved to be quite\u000aexcellent. Morgan Freeman and Tim Robbins were robbed by the Academy\u000awhen this movie came out. They both deserved to win awards for these\u000aperformances. Morgan Freeman that comes as no shock as he can elevate\u000amost anything from trash to gold so when you give him a good role it\u000abecomes practically transcendent.Tim Robins was more of a surprise to me. I have seen him in a few\u000amovies but he never really left much of an impression on me. In this\u000afilm though he provided one of the 90's best performances. The rest of\u000athe cast also filled out quite well. James Whitemore was heartbreaking\u000ain his role as the elderly librarian. This movie deserves its spot on\u000aat #2 on the IMDb top list and I would actually argue that it should\u000abump The Godfather out as I think that movie is highly over-rated but\u000athen that's just me.If you haven't seen this movie than I suggest that you go out and rent\u000ait now. Better yet just buy it as I doubt you will be disappointed.\u000aCheers!\u000a

V\u000aThe only way to summarize The Shawhank Redemption is with one word\u000aIncredible. This movie is beautifully told and magically shown on the\u000ascreen. It will bring a tear to your eye and fill you with hope. Andy\u000aDufresne is convicted murderer. He has to spend two life terms in\u000aShawshank state prison. There he gets brutally gang raped and meets\u000amany friends including Red the guy who can get things. If you have\u000anever seen this movie then you must be crazy. This may be a prison\u000amovie but the only crime is if you don't watch it. I strongly advice\u000ayou to see this movie especially if you are having hard times this will\u000amake you feel and think so much better. You have to see this movie!!!\u000aAndy triumphs over adversity in this heartwarming movie of love and\u000afriendship.\u000a

V\u000aThe shawshank prison is the movie telling us not to give up hope in any\u000acircumstances. This is about the Andy who escaped from the shawshank\u000aprison. He comes to a jail because he killed his wife and her lover.\u000aBut he insists that he didn't. Andy meets red who have been prisoned\u000afor 20 years because of the murder. Andy never talks and gets along\u000awith other prisoners at first. He needs time to get accustomed to\u000aprison life. Andy becomes the financial adviser for the guard and at\u000alast for the noton, captain of the prison. He gets trust from the Noton\u000aand has better life in prison. One day, Tommy , a TV thief, comes into\u000aa jail. He says that he knows the real criminal who killed the two\u000apeople. Being shocked, Andy ask Noton to have him rejudged in court.\u000aBut Noton gets him solitary confinement because he is afraid of losing\u000ahim as a financial manager. From that time he is gonna get ready for\u000aredemption from prison. Eventually he do make it. He makes the tunnel\u000ato the outside with a tiny hammer. I think the lesson from this movie\u000ais that man should not give up hope for the better life.\u000a

V\u000a(Spoilers)The Shawshank Redemption. A large Maine penitentiary where one\u000aconvicted banker/murder ends up. Andy Dufrey (Tim Robbins) has landed a\u000adouble life sentence in the penitentiary and must deal with life behind\u000abars. During the duration of this powerhouse of a movie we see how\u000ainmates are truly institutionalized and their lives are virtually\u000adestroyed by their time spent in jail.After the suicide of Brooks, the movie takes a new turn and Andy's\u000acharacter begins to develop. He remodels the jail library, helps guards\u000awith their taxes and even finds the time to educate inmates. But during\u000athese times the Warden begins to bet Andy involved with illegal\u000aactivity. Not to ruin it I'll leave it at that. The Shawshank Redemption is the definition of an amazing movie. While\u000abeing entertaining and emotional the movie shows us the atrocities of\u000ajail life that only Stephen King could bring and how even in the\u000adarkest of times hope can survive. Robbins as Dufrey and Freeman as his\u000abuddy Red both do amazing jobs with their characters and deserved more\u000athan it was awarded by the Academy and Golden Globes. The Shawshank Redemption. 5 out of 5 Stars.\u000a

V\u000aAbsolute travesty that it lost the Oscar to feel-good trash like\u000aForrest Gump.I like the fact that the Shawshank Redemption didn't bother tying up\u000athe loose end of the 'real' murderer remaining free. It was sufficient\u000afor Andy that he knew he did not commit the murders. He lived his life\u000afor the future, not for the past.There is something very touching about the scene where Andy does some\u000afinancial work for one of the warders, and all the prisoners get beer\u000aas a result. He just sits back and smiles - and his unselfish act has\u000asuch excellent consequences for him, both with his relations with the\u000aother prisoners, the 'sisters' and the guards.\u000a

V\u000aShawshank Redemption.. Where do I start..?By far, the greatest film ever made. My eyes were glued to it the whole\u000away through. Amazing. It was so great to watch.. I loved it. The idea\u000aand storyline of the film is just such a good idea. Finally I've seen a\u000adecent prison-life film. If you have this stacked away in your cupboard\u000aand haven't watched it, make sure you do! It's a fabulous film and I\u000arecommend it to anyone who likes watching a mystery, drama or even\u000apeople who enjoy a cry.Chris Harris Number 1 Shawshank Redemption Fan\u000a

V\u000aI'll go out on a limb and say this is the greatest movie ever made. The\u000afirst time you see this movie and are not aware of its "secret" it\u000aseems like an average movie, with a good plot and great acting. This is\u000athe rare movie that actually gets better the more times you watch it.\u000aI've seen it more than 30 times and I just never get tired of it. If\u000ayou like movies about perservering in the face of adversity and never\u000agiving up, then this movie will definitely appeal to you. Be sure and\u000abuy the DVD so you can see the extras about the location and all the\u000abackstories related to the movie. It's well worth the price. The\u000acinematography, the writing, the acting, the direction -- everything is\u000abrilliant. This is one case where the movie is actually far better than\u000athe book or short story.\u000a

V\u000aLet me try. As a former Cop injured on the job in 1998 it's sometimes\u000aeasy to despair. For many of us It's almost as if, we cannot see the\u000ablessings in our life unless they are taken from us or we lose them.\u000aThis movie is about Hope. That's what makes this movie so special.\u000athere is a deep lesson in this film and like a work of abstract art,\u000ait's what you chose to take from it that makes it whatever it is. For\u000ame it's the message that no matter what, it isn't over till it's over.\u000aAnd to quote the film. Get busy living or get busy dying. That's a\u000amessage. I'm going to try to live it out. Also the entire cast are\u000aincredible in their roles.\u000a

V\u000aI was compelled to read the Forrest Gump thread entitled "worst movie\u000aever to win the best picture", it broke my heart with the same impact\u000athat the year 1994 did when it released Shawshank and Forrest in the\u000asame year. I went to the movies 3 times to see Forrest Gump during the\u000asummer after I graduated High School. I couldn't have identified with a\u000amovie any more during this phase of limbo and floating through life\u000aboth laughing and crying. Unfortunately, I was so enraptured with this\u000afilm and my innocence of being 18 that I did not see Shawshank until it\u000awas released on video and I viewed this movie 3 times with 3 different\u000agroups of people in 24 hours, running around my South Jersey area\u000alooking for worthy disciples that had also missed out on one of the\u000abest movies I had ever seen as well. Shawshank was a victim of\u000acircumstance not only in my little world but in the real world as well.\u000aI wish it could have somehow won a co-Acadamy Award, like a rare-MVP\u000aaward in sports, but it would take away from its infamous underdog/goat\u000astatus like the Boston Red Sox. (who knows maybe they will wait 86\u000ayears and finally give it the praise it is due?)\u000a

V\u000aThis is simply the greatest film ever made. when you see this movie it\u000awill take to a place of where it is not just a movie but the greatest\u000astory ever told and some amazing directing by Frank Darabont, the\u000aacting is also great and it stays strong for the whole movie. This\u000amovie deals with personal encounters and problems the characters will\u000aface, on top of that it contains unforgettable dialog and some moments\u000ayou will never forget, you will be truly moved by this movie and will\u000awish it will never end. because this is my favorite movie of all time\u000ait was not hard to get in that place because of how great it was, i\u000athought it was even better than the classic "The Godfather". this is a\u000amovie i will recommend to everyone who like movies movies because trust\u000ame you will love this.Morgan Freeman in my opinion is one of the greatest actors and has only\u000awon an Oscar for his work in Clint Eastwoods "Million Dollar Baby". I\u000athought he should have won and ward here and for "Driving Miss Daisy".\u000aHe has just recently been in the thrilling "Batman Begins" which the\u000abest out of the "Batman" franchise. Tim Robbins is a varied actor, I'm\u000anot saying his movies are either good or bad, what I'm saying is he can\u000aplay any role like in "Bull Durham" he plays a cocky baseball player\u000aand in "Mystic River" he plays a disturbed family man. But when you see\u000aFreeman and Robbins together on screen it is something very special and\u000ain this situation it creates the greatest film of all time.Frank Darbont, the man behind "The Green Mile" and "The Majestic" wrote\u000aand directed this wonderful film adapted from the Stephen King Novela\u000a"Rita Hayorth and the Shawsank Redemtion". This is the best adapted\u000aKing book, only a few others are that good, Stanley Kubricks thrilling\u000aadaptation of "The Shinig" and Darbonts "The Green Mile". frank\u000aDarabont does not drag on anything in this movie because not once did I\u000aget bored, you may think that there is not much that goes on in this\u000amovie but there is always something that is happening. At the beginning you think that Andy(Robbins) will not be able to last\u000athe first night, and you see Red(Freeman) and his friends making bets\u000aon who will freak out, to their surprise it is the fatty who freaks and\u000aHadley beats him over the head which ends up killing him. After this\u000aAndy knows he is going to have to stand up for himself, he quickly\u000abecomes friends with Red but enemies with Heywood. Heywood and his\u000afriends would beat on Andy because he is the new guy. I wont say\u000aanything else about the movie because I don't want to give any\u000aspoilers. 10/10\u000a

V\u000aThe godfather was the best film ever made until I saw The Shawshank\u000aRedemption. The story, performance, sound, everything is amazing in\u000athis film, even though you ask yourself who is good and who is evil but\u000ait show us that revenge is a dish that tastes better when is cold. Tim\u000aRobbins is excellent. But Morgan Freeman ratifies as one of the best\u000aactors of all times, and of course Stephen King's story is at the same\u000alevel of his best. Many people talk about this picture that never get\u000aone single Oscar and compares with many of those that won that prize.\u000aAnd why not to talk about Frank Darabont who gives us such a picture as\u000athe green mile. For me and many people is among the best films in all\u000atimes.\u000a

V\u000aWhen I first came across the title "Shawshank Redemption" I didn't have\u000aa clue as to what it was about, since I didn't know the plot. But it\u000ahad Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman as it's stars, so I figured that it\u000awas worth a peek. What a peek!! This movie is awesome!! Not the classic\u000atale of a innocent man being sent to jail for a crime that he didn't\u000acommit, this movie was much more detailed. It shows you how cruel\u000aprison life can be. (Although, if you want a better picture of prison\u000alife today, I suggest watching "American Me") You have everything in\u000athis picture, Corrupt Prison Warden, Sadistic Guards, and a innocent\u000aman caught in the middle. You can not help but admire Tim Robbins\u000acharacter "Andy Dufresne" as he waits patiently for almost 20 years\u000abefore he is able to rectify his situation. Talk about patience and\u000aperseverance! This is one movie that will tug at your heart. Excellent\u000amovie.\u000a

V\u000aThis is simply one of the greatest if not "the greatest" movie ever\u000amade. It's a beautiful story, presented excellently by Frank Darabont,\u000aand brilliant writing in the part of Stephen King.Even though this is a fictional story, it's so well presented, that you\u000afeel like you're a silent character in the film. You are made to feel\u000alike your're in the cast. You almost expect your name to appear in the\u000acredits. The character development was excellent, from the main\u000acharacters played by Morgan Freeman, and Tim Robbins, all the way to\u000a"the sisters", Although we may not have liked them, we feel that we\u000asomehow know them and can relate to their specific plights. However it\u000awas done very well, because none of them overshadow the main\u000acharacters, and the main plot of the film. Undoubtedly a Classic.\u000aShould be studied as long as film exists.\u000a

V\u000aShawshank Redemption was a brilliant film that was original and\u000abelievable. It was a story that truly touched my heart, about\u000afriendship, survival, Hope and trust. The twists in the film were so\u000aunexpected, Andy was an Exceptional character that grew on me as the\u000afilm progressed, the character Red helped to contribute to the\u000aoriginality and clever thought that formed this film. I thought using\u000aMorgan Freeman (Red) as a narrator was really a different idea. The\u000adirector not only thought about the scenery but also used colours and\u000alighting in the film very cleverly The director of this film definitely\u000adeserves a pat on the Back!!! All together we give this film 10/10 I\u000adefinitely recommend It!!! Sedge n Melissa.\u000a

V\u000aI have to give this Film Credit, Defiently when credit is due. This Was\u000aan outstanding film. The history of this film was that it actually was\u000ataken off of short story from Steven king. and as I'm not a great fan\u000aof Steven King. I would say this movie is like a Flower that grown out\u000aof dirt. The Story is about a man. and the power that hope can achieve.\u000aIn jail he accomplished things and hardships no man should suffer. he\u000atriumph in goals and achieves without deferring. and he never gave up\u000ahope. It took us on a roller-coaster and in the end it showed us that\u000amiracles can blossom where you would never expect it. It was a\u000abeautiful and it deserved a lot more then it ever got.\u000a

V\u000aThe Shawshank Redemption is considered by many to be one of the\u000agreatest films of all time. Yet as with any classic, we must not be\u000ablinded by its popularity, lest we overlook its flaws. And The\u000aShawshank Redemption is not without its difficulties, but beyond those\u000adifficulties lies a heartfelt film, a film resilient in its\u000ahopefulness.The Shawshank Redemption, for the most part, is seen through the eyes\u000aof Red, a prisoner in a high-security Maine prison who has been\u000aconvicted on a charge of murder. Yet Red is not the true focus of the\u000afilm, as Andy Dufresne steps onto the scene, convicted of murdering his\u000awife and her lover. Red soon develops a friendship with Dufresne, and\u000aRed observes Dufresne like a curious onlooker, awed by his courage and\u000aknowledge.These characters, the compelling story, and the direction are the three\u000astrongest points of the film. Each character is filled with life and\u000aplays an important role in both the film as a whole and in Dufresne's\u000alife. Never for a moment does the viewer question the plausibility of\u000athe characters and the circumstances in which they find themselves.\u000aThis is where the story comes in, as the film contrasts dark reality\u000awith brilliance of hope. The story sucks the viewer into the film from\u000athe beginning, until it is so captivating, that the viewer could not\u000aescape if he tried. Furthermore, I was pleasantly amazed by Durabont's\u000adirection, as he creatively used the camera to capture even more\u000awonderfully the hopefulness of the film.However, Durabont has other difficulties, amongst which is the\u000ascreenplay that he himself authored. Yes, there are times when the\u000ascreenplay is emotional and heart-breaking, but there are also some\u000afoolish, implausible lines that detract from the movie's effect. Words\u000awere sometimes spoken when there should have been silence, leaving less\u000ainterpretation up to the viewer while spitting clichés out from the\u000acharacters' mouth. I felt that the acting was lacking a bit as well,\u000aeven though as the viewer gets more used to the characters, their\u000aacting seems to fit, albeit imperfectly.In conclusion, the high points of this film are higher than the low\u000apoints are low. People generally like this film, and it's easy to see\u000awhy, as it examines human existence in its own distinctive way. This\u000aexamination has led it be considered one of the best films of the\u000a1990s.Final Grade: A-.\u000a

V\u000aThe Shawshank Redemption is my favourite movie of all time. Why? Well\u000aas you can see it is third now in the list of IMDb.com top movies ever\u000aand is praised by actually everyone i've talked about it and every\u000acritic. But that's not me. Everyone can have their say and mine is that\u000abig part of this movies high quality comes from the everlasting theme\u000aof hope and of the fact that the filmmakers can make you like and even\u000alove the characters, though they are murderers, thieves and so on. That\u000ais hard to achieve and it is a remarkable mistake not to have honored\u000athe best adapted screenplay Oscar to this movie. Best picture also\u000awould have been the right choice(though it would have been fun to see\u000aPulp Fiction win). And of course not only the movie's acting is perfect\u000aeverything else is in it's superb place too. The music, the\u000acinematography etc.What happens is that, to ME, this movie is perfect. It's got everything\u000aa movie need and then some(and more). Maybe you can say it's caused bit\u000aof the hype of everyone saying it is such great movie, but I can't deny\u000ait's place on example in this list, and nor can I say that it is\u000aoverrated. So if you haven't seen it(and you propably have) the watch\u000ait as soon as you can! You just must...\u000a

V\u000aI didn't see this movie in the theaters when it came out. I had never\u000abeen a big Steven King fan, and it just didn't catch my imagination. A\u000afriend brought the video over one night for us to watch it, and MAN! I\u000awas blown away. The theme of the movie is hope, and what hope, and the\u000alack thereof, does to people. This is truly one of the most uplifting\u000afilms which I think was ever made.I thought that everything in the film clicked. The acting, the\u000adirection, the cinematography, the music, all were perfect. I have read\u000asome posts where people don't like the ending, but I think the\u000aregressing shot of the two friends is right on; you see the culmination\u000aof the struggle to be free for both men, yet it's not in your face\u000asappy.As far as the best scene, I would have to say it's a three way toss-up:1: The aria scene 2: Brook's suicide 3: Red in the wheat fieldI probably pull the DVD out once a month or so to watch this gem.

V\u000aThe Shawshank Redemption is about Andy Dufresne who was sent to\u000aShawshank Prison for the double homicide of his cheating wife and her\u000asecret lover. But instead of feeling sorry for himself he lived the\u000abest he could and bettered the lives of fellow inmates through shear\u000adetermination. In the process, he made many friends (Ellis 'Red'\u000aRedding being most notable of all) and even gained the respect of\u000aprison guards. Despite of serving back to back life sentences, Andy\u000anever gave up his ultimate dream of one day living by the ocean. That\u000adream was further jeopardized because of what he knew, and there was\u000asomeone who will go to great lengths to keep him locked up forever.\u000aWill Andy finally crack and lose hope, or will his perseverance\u000aprevail?The Shawshank Redemption is the best movie that I've ever seen. I even\u000alike it better than any of the Godfather movies (which have a\u000acompletely different theme up to the last episode). Perhaps I like this\u000amovie so much because it suits my taste. But I think most viewers of\u000aall kinds will appreciate Shawshank for the superb acting of the main\u000acharacters, the insightful dialogs throughout, the powerful message it\u000aconveys, and the realness of the lives of convicts both inside the\u000aprison and outside once they're paroled.It's a shame that Shawshank didn't win many awards since '94 was a\u000atremendous year with the release of other great films like Pulp Fiction\u000aand Forrest Gump. But the acting and directing of this film was still\u000aoutstanding. I can't ever imagine serving a life sentence, and prison\u000alife was much different in the mid 1900's from today. Still I was able\u000ato relate to what the main characters were feeling, and I was moved by\u000atheir words and actions numerous times (especially those of Brooks).The underlying theme of Shawshank was simple; it celebrated hope and\u000aperseverance just like Lord of the Rings. Hope and perseverance are\u000aindeed powerful elements in arts, and both films have done a marvelous\u000ajob portraying these two aspects. However, Shawshank seemed more real\u000abecause frankly it was set in our world and not a fantasy one. This is\u000ano knock against LOTR, but I find myself more involved in this film\u000abecause I could relate to it more and it made a deeper impact on me.******POSSIBLE SPOILERS BELOW******Of course no film is perfect. There are minor details here and there\u000athan didn't make sense to me. For example, how could the wall fall\u000aapart so easily? How could Andy cut/break such a big hole through that\u000asteel pipe with a rock? How can Shawshank Prison ignore the smuggling\u000aof things (they definitely knew since there were posters on the prison\u000awalls and men were smoking smuggled cigarettes)? But these are minor\u000athings, and don't jeopardize the integrity of Shawshank.I don't want to over-analyze Shawshank and give it away, but I would\u000ahighly recommend it to anyone who's in the mood for a serious film. My\u000afinal rating: 10/10.\u000a

V\u000aThis movie is simply outstanding and is one of the best if not the best\u000aI've ever seen. Its my joint 3rd favourite with Darabont's other great\u000aking adaptation The Green Mile and Seven. This movie is flawless on\u000aevery level. The key to it though is possibly the greatest ever script\u000aever written by Darabont, and truly outstanding acting from Morgan\u000aFreeman and Tim Robbins. No need to go into the plot. This movie is all\u000aabout hope and will inspire you to do anything. The brilliant ending is\u000adefinitely the best i've ever seen and brought a tear to my eye. Watch\u000athis movie whenever your happy or sad. It doesn't matter. The film will\u000agive you so much hope and happiness. It really is that brilliant. In\u000afact i'm watching it now.WATCH IT NOW 10/10- Probably the greatest movie ever made\u000a

V\u000aThis is by far my favorite movie of all time.How do I know this is it with so many other good movies out there? I\u000athought along before I came to the conclusion. My basis..every time,\u000ayes, every time the movie is on T.V. I stop and watch it and love every\u000aminute of it over and over.I still get tears in my eyes when the movie ends. Morgan Freeman and\u000aTim Robbins are wonderful in the movie.I think everyone knows but this is one of those rare movies that was\u000areally good that is based on a Stephen King book.This is a must see feel good movie!\u000a

V\u000aLord of the Rings:ROTK and Godfather are amazing films but the fact\u000athat Shawshank Redemption wasn't noticed as well as them is the reason\u000ai think this film is third and not first in the ranking.shawshank Redemption is a film that never won an award yet remains one\u000aof the best film ever. It is the most rented video and most sold video\u000ato this day and so it should be.To sum up this film its a prison drama with twists and turns and very\u000astrong relationships, its got everything you ever want in a film and\u000athen some, I urge people to watch this film if they haven't already.10/10\u000a

V\u000aI loved this movie and have watched it over 50 times in a 2 year\u000aperiod; I believe it should have won an academy award, but its my guess\u000athat the "bull queer" scenes removed any chance of that. The dialog\u000abetween Andy and Red was spellbinding at times and the interplay\u000abetween them and the other guys in their clique made it seem like being\u000ain prison could be enjoyable. My wife hated the movie because of the\u000ascenes containing violence and I have to admit that some of them could\u000ahave been left out, the movie really didn't need them to be successful\u000aor appear real. I originally thought I would hate this movie and didn't\u000asee it till it was on HBO TV. The other movies that come close to being\u000amost watched are Titanic and a comedy called Midnight run.\u000a

V\u000aAfter I enjoyed the movie that was the best one I had ever seen,my\u000afirst feeling was that there is hope, there is success.Indeed,hope has\u000aa very great impact on us.When Andy was put in the prison for the rest\u000aof his life,he do not give up like other prisoners.Because in his mind\u000athere was a hope that one day he could resume his freedom. Just as Andy\u000asaid"get busy living or get busy dying."So, Andy pay off in the\u000aend.Spending 19 years to dig a hole from which Andy escaped was not an\u000aeasy thing, even to my surprise,his tool for digging the hole was a\u000avery small hammer--incredible!From this ,we can see that how great hope\u000ais on a person.During the long period of 19 years, Andy suffer from\u000alots of pain,however,the powerful brief and hope made him stick to the\u000aend.I believe a person without his hope is impossible to manage it.\u000aThis movie made me know that in our real life,one must have\u000ahope,especially,when he is in trouble.There is a very famous saying\u000athat fits it:No pain,no gain.\u000a

V\u000aReview of The Shawshank RedemptionThe Shawshank Redemption is actually a very good movie what I had seen\u000atwo pass. This good movie is about hope, which is a very importance\u000athing in our life. In 1947; Andy who is a young New England banker is\u000awrongfully accused of killing his wife and her lover. And he is sent to\u000aShawshank prison. In fact Andy is innocent. But only Andy knows that he\u000adidn't commit the crimes. The prison is really black. Andy does not\u000alose his heart about his life and he can quickly adapt to prison life.\u000aAndy makes many friends in the prison. His quiet strength slowly earns\u000athe respect of his fellow inmates--most notably, Red who is an older\u000aprisoner and has given up hope --and even much of the prison staff.\u000aAndy and Red develop a deep friendship during their prison life. Andy\u000agets a job in the prison library and He uses his intelligence to\u000abefriend the guards. Then he starts helping the guards with their taxes\u000aand pension plans. He never gives up frightening realities of prison\u000alife. And he has spent nineteen years on digging a tunnel in his cell\u000awall behind a picture. Finally he has escaped from the prison\u000asuccessfully, and he takes with him 1/2 million in unmarked dirty money\u000afrom the crooked warden. Yeas later Red is set free from the Shawshank\u000aprison and he gains the money that Andy fell to him. And then Red goes\u000afor Andy. The Shawshank Redemption is a nice, funny, emotional, moving,\u000ainspiring and powerful films with a high quality of greatness that you\u000acannot put your finger on, but The Shawshank Redemption is there to\u000ashow the greatness, and it being one that reaffirms our faith in\u000asociety and in the power of hope, whether that hope is found in God or\u000aourselves. Hope is a very good thing, perhaps the best of things, and\u000aif a film can remind us of that fact, then it is a really valuable\u000amovie.\u000a

V\u000aWithout the hope and freedom, what should we do? The hero of the film\u000ais not a weak man as we image, he is a successor because he save\u000ahimself.The Shaw shank Redemption is an old story .The young banker -Andy was\u000aundeserved, but was sentenced. In the long and hopeless time, people in\u000athe prison, not only to confront the wretched environment and the\u000aexecrable turkey, but also to be controlled by the institution and to\u000abe hurt by the sore feeling. ¡°These walls are kind of funny like that:\u000afirst you hate them, then you get used to them. Enough time pass, get\u000aso you depend on them." The institution was deathly; did you have\u000aenough courage to suspect it? As the miserable old librarian in the\u000afilm, he lived in prison for most of his life, he adapted the life of\u000aprison, and so he can't live without the acquaintance and familiar\u000aenvironment. What he only can do was to make him evaporated in the\u000aworld, which did not, belong to him.But, for those execrable environments, Andy was a strong man although\u000ahe looks gentle and weak .He did his work on his own way and kept the\u000afreedom in his mind. First, he learn to tough in the wretched\u000aenvironment, and then he became a hard-bitten person. Secondly, he also\u000ahas the good friendship with his friends. Then they can help each\u000aother. Third, he can toady the person who can give him rights to\u000aprepare to flee for his life. Fourth, he caught opportunities for his\u000alife and believed every dog has his own day. Then did many things to\u000aprepare for the plan .19 years passed, with the freedom in his mind; he\u000agot his new life outside of the prison at last. The freedom belongs to\u000ahim.From the film, I understand the truth: In the walleyed floor of\u000adespair, where is God? Everyone is God for oneself. If you give up\u000ayourself, no one can help you. But if you save yourself, the hope and\u000afreedom will belong to you one day!\u000a

The holy\u000aand pure and loud and sonorous soprano wears clouds and split the silks\u000aare frozen by people who are confined firmly long. They may not know\u000awhat music it is, is to the beautiful feeling, to free aspiration,\u000aeverybody is the same. People look up and look at the dark blue\u000aboundless sky, the beautiful sincerity drifts with the wonderful\u000aharmonious sounds everywhere, the lens rises slowly, has shaken, all\u000aliving things resume and look up at on the square, so absorbed, then\u000awith deep feeling, there is no wicked to the extreme criminal, it have\u000ait is the brutal have unless prison of conduct the alert, have the\u000aequal and harmonic in involution people, what people last existence of\u000alife very much to and origin. Andy has got drunk in music and Andy has\u000aforgotten one's own private danger that puts the music on. He closes\u000athe eye to hark on the prison warden's chair happily. Later, what he\u000awas imprisoned for fortnight imprisoned alone. It is this feeling; keep\u000athe hearts of convict and visitor forever.\u000a

First,\u000aeveryone is free, don¡¯t be controlled by others, you have your ideas\u000aand behavior. Second, don¡¯t give up your courage; face the truth with\u000ayour braveness. No one can help you, but yourself. Third, if you want\u000ato succeed, the courage, strengthen tastiest and place mood.\u000a

V\u000aEveryone who has watched ¡° Shaw shank redemption¡± knows that Andy was\u000aundeserved to be in prison. If it were you what would you do? Snarl?\u000aComplain the unfair society? I will probably get suicide for the\u000ainnocence. For I am not strong enough and there is not so much power to\u000asupport me to go on my life with such heavy burden. After sentenced to\u000aprison Andy was silent. However there was an under set hidden in\u000aAndy¡¯s heart while he looked quiet. ¡°Get busy living, or get busy\u000adying¡± reminds me a saying by famous Chinese writer Lu Sun. That is\u000a¡°break out in silence or perdition in silence¡±. There is another set of dialogue that is impressive. Red: ¡°Hope is a\u000adangerous thing¡± but Andy said: ¡°Hope is a good thing.¡± His escaping\u000ais the strongest evidence. Andy got a hope for which he can be busy. No\u000aother than this conviction set him free once more. Andy is a bird with\u000abeautiful feather and it is sin to forbid him in prison. Escaping is\u000apredetermined. Miracle is coming true by Andy¡¯s Rock-hammer. In the film, dialogue between Andy and Red and Red¡¯s monologue\u000adescribed vivid interpersonal activity. And this peaceful talking may\u000astimulate readers¡¯ inner billows better than exciting dialogue.\u000aAndy¡¯s guilt to his wife has been released and got redemption after\u000alocking in Shaw shank prison for nigh teen years. The heaviest burden\u000aof a person in one¡¯s lifetime is from inside rather than outside. Lots\u000aof lines in the film are valuable for us to take our time to taste it.\u000aAnd everyone shall remember that hope is a good thing.\u000a

V\u000aAfter watching this movie, I was deeply shocked by the scenic: an old\u000aman, who was just released from the prison not ling before, ended his\u000avalued life by a rope. What put him into despair after all?? I wonder.The old man, like most prisoners there, was eager for freedom at the\u000afirst minutes he was put into the prison. Now getting rid of the\u000aterrible life , he should be happy and grateful .however , when he set\u000ahis feet first on the land outside the prison gate, he stood for a\u000ashort while and watched around with the expression of confusion and\u000asuspicion on his wrinkling face before setting off. I can imagine what\u000ahis reaction was. ¡°Is it the same world before I was sent into the\u000aprison?¡± no! Everything is rather strange to him as if he was a UFO.He went into the prison as a young man and came out as an old man. He\u000awas used to living in the world surrounded by four high and thick\u000awalls. Everything was done as told .No choices, no rights. Although he\u000awas a free man now, what could an old man do to survive himself in the\u000aworld full of intensive competition? Long years¡¯ stay in the prison\u000amade him an impotent man. How could he develop new abilities to keep\u000apace of times? NO one understood him and showed sympathy on him, but\u000ablamed him for his clumsiness and sluggishness. nobody paid attention\u000ato him and cared about him. What a lonely man!!! No wonder that the old\u000aman felt himself useless and helpless and committed suicide.At this point, I can not help asking one question. Who pleads guilty or\u000awho is responsible for this matter? Maybe you will say it is none of\u000ayour business. Is it only the old man¡¯s personal affairs? Do\u000agovernments or the authorities set the institutes like prisons for the\u000apurpose to let those who commit crimes have the chance to turn a new\u000aleaf of their life? Undoubtfully. But why do they reject again and\u000aagain those who have realized their guilt and decided to lead a new\u000alife? It is clear that they do not want to free any prisoner until all\u000aare too old to contribute to society. What a satire!!!This film reflects such a phenomenon, which should be paid special\u000aattention to not only by the authorities but also by ordinary citizens.\u000a

V\u000aThis is the first movie that I have seen for three times and is still\u000acrazy about it. It is just because it touches the right chord of mine.This movie didn¡¯t attract its viewers by handsome and beautiful actors\u000aand actresses. The beginning of the story is also a common one ¡ª¡ª\u000aAndy Dufresn £¬a young but promising banker is convinced of having\u000amurdered his wife and her lover¡£Even though he is innocent£¬ he¡¯ s\u000asentenced to a life term at the Shawshank State Prison ¡£¡°These walls are kind of funny like that. First you hate them , then\u000ayou get used them .Enough time passed ,get so you depend on them .\u000aThat¡¯s institutionalizing.¡± This is what the way people around\u000aDufrane in Shawshank State Prison think and the way they live. You can\u000aimagine what a difficult task for Dufrane to stay in the prison. It\u000aseems that there is no hope for him to get freedom back. But all the\u000aawful things are not that awful in Dufrane¡¯s eyes. He maintains hope\u000athat one day he will be free. At last ,he succeeds.No matter how awful things might get, you can't just lay down and die,\u000ayou have to keep fighting. Andy's attitude throughout the movie is just\u000athis and The message the movie ultimately sends to us . So you if you\u000adidn¡¯t pass the exams , please don¡¯t be upset and lose heart. . At\u000aleast you still have the freedom to do what you please. Dufrane's drive\u000afor hope is an admirable one. Even during the worst of times, Andy\u000anever wavers. So my dear you, where is the god ? God is youeself. Faced\u000awith the same situation, try to deal with things in a way similar to\u000aDufrane. Hope is the only thing make you successful.\u000a

V\u000aWhen i first heard about the Shawshank redemption i was dubious because\u000ai have not really been interested in prison films. Once i had watched\u000ait i immediately went and bought the DVD. I must have watched this film\u000adozens of times (which is very unusual for me). The acting, story-line,\u000ascenery where all amazing and when the subject of favourite films is\u000adiscussed my friends and family most people have the Shawshank\u000aRedemption as there favourite or at least in their top 3. Morgan\u000aFreeman and Tim Robins are perfect as the lead characters and you\u000abecome so absorbed in there characters. Thoroughly recommended as this\u000ais a classic.\u000a

V\u000aI have seen this movie over and over, and I have never been able to\u000afind any movie better then this one. Every time I watch this movie I\u000asee something new. I would call this perfect. And then 7 Oscar\u000aNominations and the place here at IMDb top 250 speaks for it self I\u000athink.I am gonna give my comment on it anyways.First of all the movie is based on a novel by Stephen King, one of my\u000afavorite writers. Some of his books have become terrible movies, while\u000asome of them are classics. Movies like The Green Mile, Stand By Me, The\u000aShining etc, they are all classics, and this one just stand out to be\u000athe best of them all.Secondly the actors. Morgan Freeman who never does a bad job in a\u000amovie, and if it wasn't for Forest Gump that came out the same year, I\u000aam sure he would have been winning best Actor that year at the Oscars.\u000aSame goes for Tim Robbins, another class actor, and here he really is\u000aat his best. Actually, I cant find any actor making a bad job in this\u000amovie, not even small roles from supporting characters.The sound track might not be the most exciting, but it for sure really\u000asuits the movie, and does not spoil any of the dialogs. The cutting,\u000aand the way the movie is filmed is also one of the best I ever seen.In the beginning there is a court where Andy Duofrense played by Tim\u000aRobbins try to claim his innocence after his wife have been murdered.\u000aEven if he is innocence all proves against him and he get judged to\u000aprison. It all start out with the new prisoners arriving. Andy\u000aDuofrense is one of those, and he seem to be one who does not seem to\u000abe bothered about being in a prison, cause he walk around like he was a\u000afree bird who could leave his cage whenever he wants.Eventually Andy and Red(Morgan Freeman) becomes friends, and Red is the\u000aguy in the prison who can fix everything. So Andy asks Red to fix a\u000aposter and a small hammer for him. That is eventually the key to\u000afreedom..There is a lot of lovely scenes in this movie. Like when Andy managed\u000ato get his prisoner m8's beer while they are fixing the roof.I ain't gonna say more about this movie, cause it really is one long\u000alovely story, and you have to see it.I rate this 10/10, and it is the perfect movie, and the only movie I\u000arated 10!\u000a

V\u000aPerhaps the best movie ever shot, as evidenced by its rating of #3 on\u000aIMDb's top 250 list. This movie is so good, my words will do it little\u000ajustice, but alas, I will try. The music: perfect. The actors: Morgan\u000aFreeman in his best role, in a word perfect. The pacing: its long, but\u000athis accurately portrays the idea of time in prison. The theme:\u000awonderful, and inspiring at every viewing. If you have not seen this\u000amovie, you must. You will not regret it. The "Shawshank Redemption" is\u000athe most overlooked movie in history... this movie should have won a\u000anumber of Oscars, among other awards. It is just that good. Go rent it,\u000abuy it, borrow it, whatever, just see it!\u000a

V\u000aFrank Darabont's "The Shawshank Redemption", starring Tim Robbins and\u000aMorgan Freeman, is the greatest film ever made in Hollywood. Plain and\u000asimple. The film tells the involving story of two prisoners at\u000aShawshank Prison, and their decades together under the thumb of a cruel\u000awarden and his henchman. Andy (Tim Robbins, never better) is an\u000ainnocent man, who uses his accounting skills to make himself useful to\u000athe warden, and struggles to keep up hope, against the counsel of his\u000afellow inmates. Red (Morgan Freeman, astonishing) thinks hope is a\u000adangerous thing, and is an institutionalized man, who can't imagine\u000alife outside of the prison walls. The film also stars Bob Gunton,\u000aClancy Brown, William Sadler, and, in a powerful performance, James\u000aWhitmore. I'll say no more, because this film must be seen to be\u000aunderstood.\u000a

The speeches, Morgan Freeman's\u000aacting...my oh my, just brilliant, absolutely brilliant. The movie\u000ashows how crucial it is for us human beings to live in a world of hope,\u000aand not in fear. As he says in the movie, "...so beautiful, it can't be\u000aexpressed in words, some things are best left unsaid"...that line is\u000avery true of this masterpiece. I will say no more, but just bow down to\u000apossibly the GREATEST movie that there was, there is, and there ever\u000awill be!\u000a

V\u000aIt's the most impressing movie I've ever seen.I saw it coincidentally\u000abut was shocked very much by Tim and Morgan's acts.Especially at the\u000aend of the movie,I am aware of what is hope and how one can keep his\u000amind alive.Is there anything more difficult for a single person to dig\u000aa hole through a wall in a jail within 19 years?We always consider it\u000aas one out of ten films that men have to see in his life(certainly it's\u000aon top).It's very pity that the Academy Reward neglected it,Tim should\u000awin all awards in 1994.Although few people have heard it before but if\u000aone is asked to see it ,he is surely very fond of it and thinks it is\u000athe best .I believe that Redemption will stay as long as I live on my\u000amind.\u000a

V\u000aOne of those very rare movies, that even though you may have it on DVD\u000aor tape, you'll still stop and watch the WHOLE movie to the very end if\u000ayou find it playing while 'channel surfing'. I, like everyone else I\u000aknow, found out about this movie from someone else; I did not see this\u000aat the movies. So, I rented it and was (like everyone else apparently)\u000ablown away by this true cinematic masterpiece. Over the past ten years\u000amy wife and I have probably seen the movie a couple of dozen times\u000aeach. If someone out there needs a 'pick-me-up' movie' (we ALL do\u000asometimes!), then this is YOUR movie. It's always guaranteed to always\u000aremind one that "Hope is a Good Thing...."\u000a

V\u000aThis is by far one of the best movies made. It talks of hope, patience,\u000athe will to prove the truth and above all, friendship. Andy's fight\u000awith hopelessness and the tragedy that he is forced to face is truly\u000ainspiring. Not once do we see him beaten down by the situation. He not\u000aonly saves himself but also puts back new life into the likes of Red\u000aand Tommy. A few scenes like the time when Andy plays the music over\u000athe loudspeaker, "Brooks was here, So was Red", the climax are all\u000aunforgettable. The dialogues and the performances are flawless. Andy is wrongly accused of killing his wife and her lover. He ends up\u000ain Shawshank, a place where a normal being would succumb to the\u000ahelplessness. But Andy fights it out. The "change" Andy brings about in\u000athe situation in Shawshank is probably impossible. The story is\u000anarrated by Red, Andy's best friend inside and later. Truly, an amazing\u000amovie!\u000a

V\u000aHope. It is the single most powerful human emotion. It can keep you\u000aalive, and it can destroy your life. Hope can be the one thing left in\u000aa world where everything else is taken from you- and The Shawshank\u000aRedemption is the perfect artistic visualization of the tremendous\u000apower that hope can have over someone who has lost everything else. The opening scene introduces us to a young and successful banker named\u000aAndy Dufresne, and the things that have transpired to destroy his life.\u000aWe can't help but feel sympathy toward a man who finds out that his\u000awife is having an affair, and then gets convicted for the double\u000ahomicide of his wife and her lover- when he is innocent of the crime.\u000aTaken to Shawshank prison for two life sentences, Andy has had his\u000aentire life taken from him in a spiral of terrible events. It only gets\u000aworse at the prison, as the brutality of the prison guards is\u000aunbridled, and a few inmates make his life hell. However, Andy\u000acontinually surprises the audience with his resilience and his\u000acharacter finds ways to amaze the inmates, the guards, the warden, and\u000athe audience. The story itself is not wholly original or\u000agroundbreaking, and there is no 'surprise-ending' or major twists that\u000acome out of nowhere to shock the audience. However, it is in the\u000adelivery of the story that this film excels beyond all others. Every aspect of this movie compliments the incredible script written by\u000aFrank Darabont that was based on Stephen King's novella. The music is a\u000acomposition of slow-moving and peaceful ballads that bring out just how\u000along-winded a life sentence in prison can be, and how undaunted Andy is\u000aby the terrible environment he is in. The cameras move slowly and\u000asteadily, repeatedly scanning the prison and also emphasizing the\u000aendless span that life in prison truly is. On the artistic side, the\u000amovie is something to behold. But ultimately, what brings the entire\u000amovie together is the beautifully written and exceptionally delivered\u000anarration of Morgan Freeman, playing a fellow inmate named Ellis 'Red'\u000aRedding. Not only are we given a view into Andy's character through\u000athis man's observations, but we also see how Red himself changes his\u000alife as a result of Andy Dufresne.The amazing thing about this film is how every detail in the entire\u000amovie somehow contributes to the story on the whole. It takes a few\u000atimes of viewing before you can really appreciate just how intricate\u000athe plot is- how every single moment helps increase the power of the\u000aincredible ending sequence. It is not too complex, with many tangents\u000athat end up confusing the viewer. Instead, it runs with a simple theme\u000aand adds to it with everything that is depicted. The only negative\u000athing I have to say about this movie is that the ending seems a bit\u000adrawn out, but by this time you are so enthralled and satisfied as a\u000aviewer that it should not pose a problem. A great story, told flawlessly, with a powerful message. There is not a\u000alot more that you could ask for in a movie. Entertaining and inspiring.\u000aDeep, yet not complicated. A message delivered with undeniable power,\u000aand an excellent movie experience overall. If you have ever felt like\u000aeverything has been taken from you, then learn from Andy Dufresne.\u000a'There's something inside that they can't get to, that they can't\u000atouch. It's yours.' Hope. It can set you free.\u000a

V\u000aI am a movie buff, seen just about all the classics, new and old, but\u000aShawshank is number 1. I think LOR attempts, in a much more complicated\u000amanner, to deliver a similar theme - hope even in the most bleak of\u000atimes. Shawshank delivers this message even more effectively than LOR,\u000aand crystalizes the message of hope as the single most important thing\u000ain our lives, even more than love. Many of us do not have love in our\u000alives - but hope makes us continue, search for a better life, a better\u000aday. I like to put it this way, nothing ever good in this world ever\u000acame from quitting, giving up. All that is good in this world, came\u000athrough persistance, hard work, determination.....hope. No other piece\u000aof movie making has ever reflected this message better than The\u000aShawshank Redemption.\u000a

V\u000aEight or nine times now I have marvelled at this masterpiece. Every\u000acharacter is right on the money, the main performers especially Freeman\u000aare simply outstanding. However it is the smaller characters like\u000aBrooks and Heywood that add the subtle ingredients that most pictures\u000amiss out on. The story of redemption is an old one, the performances\u000aand soundtrack to say nothing of the grimy screenplay lift this way\u000aabove the genre. It is almost impossible to pick a highlight, but perm\u000afrom the Mozart scene, the bottle of suds, the letter from Brooks and\u000athe denouement and you have a cocktail of perfection. It is adult, it\u000ais moving and it is hugely satisfying, everyone should see this at\u000aleast once and the fact that it bombed at the box office first time\u000around says more about the audiences and press reviews than the movie\u000aitself. It should have won 7 Oscars, but who cares they are a plastic\u000aHollywood manifestation, for anyone with an ounce of taste this is the\u000afinest movie of all time, by a mile.\u000a

V\u000aI picked this up on video seven years ago. The movie bombed in the UK.\u000aThe story inspires hope, whether your male or female. The rich\u000acharacterization is skillfully handled by Robbins and Freeman.\u000aDarabont's script sets up quite a gripping visual antagonism that\u000awholly rewards the audience with a feel-good ending. It made me weep,\u000atime and again. And when you lose hope the film's portrayal of\u000aredemption over adversity can lead to your own redemption. The power of\u000athe visual and the word of hope make this a great film. It has already\u000aspurned the box office in favour of the people. It is more than just a\u000acommercial venture it is a damn good yarn that provides inspiration to\u000athose who need it. It is the William Blake of scripture, dividing\u000aheaven and hell, and the corruption of good. My video copy wore out\u000aearlier this year so I'm happily in possession of the 10th anniversary\u000aDVD. Best movie in 75 years. Buy two copies your sure to get one\u000astolen.\u000a

V\u000a\u000aI have seen this movie several times, and love it. I even own the VHS.\u000aIt wasn't until today that i realized that it is very similar to a\u000astory from the Christian Bible, specifically, the Gospel of Luke,\u000achapter 18, verses 1-8. The story of the Unjust Judge and the\u000apersistent widow. The prison warden is the Unjust Judge. Red is the\u000awidow, so is Andy in many cases. But, most importantly, Andy is the\u000aexample of persistence and faith. It was not prayer or faith in God\u000athat he exemplified in the movie, of course. But, it was persistence in\u000ahis innocence, in digging through the sandstone for so many years, in\u000againing his freedom. Persistence in getting books for the library to\u000athe benefit of self and so many others. He had faith, he had\u000apersistence. And who says the Bible doesn't relate to real life today?\u000a\u000a

V\u000a\u000aThe Shawshank Redemption is easily the greatest movie ever. It is such\u000aan amazing journey of two people throughout approximately twenty years\u000aof a prison sentence. The evolution of their friendship (Andy played by\u000aTim Robbins and Red played by Morgan Freeman) over that period is just\u000aamazing how they go from not knowing each other to very close best\u000afriends. I love to see how Andy, through his financial prowess, is able\u000ato accomplish so much for him, his friends, and fellow prisoners. Bob\u000aGunton as the warden and Clancy Brown as the head prison guard were\u000aalso amazing in there roles. Brown was very authoritative and violent\u000ain his control of the prison. Gunton was impressive as the corrupt\u000awarden who did not like to be reminded of his misdeeds. I love when he\u000agoes nuts when Andy asks how he can be so obtuse. I think that is\u000ahilarious how somebody would take as much offense to the word obtuse.\u000aThe way that the movie ends is what made this my favorite movie of all\u000atime. I did not see that ending coming at all and I will not spoil it.\u000aTo explain how great this movie is I would say this: If you have seen\u000athe movie Gymkata and know how extremely bad that movie (except that\u000aits badness makes it hilarious), The Shawshank Redemption is as great\u000aas Gymkata is bad. This has been my review of the greatest movie ever\u000aand everybody should see this movie at least once.\u000a\u000a

V\u000a\u000aThe criteria for a classic film to become timeless is very simple. It\u000amust speak to every generation that comes in contact with it. Films\u000alike the The Wizard of Oz and Gone With the Wind, both which were\u000areleased in 1939, have obviously aged well. The Wizard of Oz, like The\u000aShawshank Redemption, was not an immediate success and yet it grew an\u000aaudience. The Shawshank Redemption is a well told story that seems to\u000aconnect with people on a basic level. It has also subsequently grown in\u000aviewership in its first decade. It will be very interesting to see how\u000ait fares 50 years from now. Will this film stand the test of time? Will\u000athis film always remain a favorite among audiences?\u000a\u000a

I think 53% of\u000athe voters have been blinded by the redemption scene and the twist at\u000athe end, sure it was neat but check your warm n' fuzzies folks. Other\u000amovies that are overrated at IMDb because of a neat twist at the end are\u000aThe Usual Suspects and The Sixth Sense. A twist does not make it\u000aPerfect.\u000a\u000a

They're acting so convincingly, you'll never forget\u000athem. So, if you would ask me, I give 10 stars of 10!P.S : I'm sorry if you find some mistakes in my English grammar, but\u000ai'm a beginner ;-).\u000a\u000a

V\u000a\u000aThe Shawshank Redemption fills me with joy and hope every time I watch\u000ait, which must be well over a few dozen times now. Tim Robbins' acting\u000ais excellent as the emotionally repressed banker in jail but Morgan\u000aFreeman, who is consistently superb in all his roles, carries the\u000aweight of this movie's intelligently uplifting spirit, its pathos,\u000awarmth and humanity. Freeman narrates the story and it's his rich voice\u000athat details the life in jail and with his majestic, patient compassion\u000aadds color to what otherwise might have felt abjectly bleak. Whenever I\u000afeel down I watch this movie for inspiration. This is the sort of movie\u000aI think people of all ages can enjoy, many times over, seeing it with\u000anew eyes at different times in their lives.\u000a\u000a

V\u000a\u000a"The Shawshank Redemption" is a film practically void of flaw: a\u000amonumental, impeccable gem, succeeding marvelously as a heartfelt tale\u000aof hardship, friendship, and above all, redemption. Practically every\u000aelement in this film is either extremely satisfying or undeniably\u000aexcellent, as everything one might desire in a dramatic experience, and\u000aeven a film experience, is executed with perfect conviction, from the\u000abrilliant, compelling performance of Morgan Freeman, to the passionate,\u000arelentless direction, to the enchanting, whimsical screenplay, to the\u000apowerful, befitting score; this film succeeds on nearly every level. It\u000ais entertainment at its best, featuring an amusing, rousing story of\u000asurvival and redemption, while attaining those sincere, practical, and\u000aoriginal qualities a "film purist" will heartily enjoy. You follow\u000aMorgan Freeman and Tim Robbins through their every experience, as their\u000atrials, tribulations, and redemption are the central themes of the\u000astory. You develop an intense bond with their struggles, and how they\u000amanage to overcome so many hardships and injustices, while still\u000aretaining confidence and hope. The resounding message here is "Fear can\u000ahold you prisoner, Hope can set you free", and oh, what a powerful,\u000aimportant message for all of us to consider. It is an absolute travesty\u000athat this brilliant, enchanting, and impeccable film was rejected for\u000aeven a single Oscar. Any other year than Forrest Gump and this would\u000ahave won gold; such a shame. I loved practically everything about this\u000afilm, as an entertainment, as an artistic achievement, and as a lesson\u000aof life: "Get busy living, or get busy dying." What a wonderful film\u000a"Shawshank" is. **** out of ****\u000a\u000a

V\u000a\u000aI enjoyed this film because it shows the way I believe our Judicial\u000asystem should be;tough, and stern. The two main characters,Red and\u000aAndy, form a friendship bond that carries them through the ordeal of\u000aprison life. They stick together and help one another.The great scene I\u000aenjoy, is when Red comes up for parole and the last time, they set him\u000afree. The officials may have thought He served his time enough, and He\u000awas older anyway.Red gave a great speech, how he regretted what he did\u000aand was very sorry.When he said he would "talk some sense" into that\u000aguy who committed that crime,I think that moved the officials to change\u000atheir minds.Morgan Freeman is wonderful in this film and I love Robbins'\u000aperformance,here.\u000a\u000a

V\u000a\u000aCurrently, on the IMDb top 250 Movies of All Time list, the top two\u000amovies both hold ratings of 9.0. Of these two, "The Shawshank\u000aRedemption" has roughly twenty thousand more votes in its favor. Ergo,\u000aI do believe that "The Shawshank Redemption" should finally ascend to\u000aits rightful place on this web-page, and hopefully cinema history, as\u000athe Greatest Film of All Time. That having been said, I wish now to give my own thoughts on this film,\u000athoughts which will be hitherto corrupted by myriad spoilers.The acting is astounding. Tim Robbins as Andy Dufresne delivers the\u000aperfect combination of hope and despair, so that you can love his\u000acharacter without ever truly knowing what he shall do next. Morgan\u000aFreeman brings subtlety and depth to a character who would perhaps\u000aotherwise be much simpler. Bob Gunton allows you to genuinely fear\u000aWarden Norton, and if James Whitmore's performance does not make you\u000alachrymose, nothing can.The plot is beautiful, describing the redemption of many an inmate.\u000aRed, though he does not escape institutionalization, becomes a good\u000aman. Tommy Williams does the same. The best of all endings however, is\u000aAndy's, as he goes through so much to come out clean in the end,\u000asomething expressed both allegorically throughout the story and\u000aliterally at the end.The greatest film I have ever seen.\u000a\u000a

V\u000a\u000a'I wish that I could tell you that Andy fought the good fightand the\u000aSisters let him be. I wish I could tell you thatbut prison is no\u000afairy-tale world.' This quote nicely sums up The Shawshank Redemption,\u000aa film that earnestly shows the violent life in prison, but chooses not\u000ato focus on the violence, rather using it to portray emotion.Andy Dufresne (Tim Robbins), a successful banker, is convicted for the\u000amurder of his wife and her lover. The judge describes Andy as cold and\u000asends him to the Shawshank prison to serve two life sentences. Andy,\u000ahowever, maintains his innocence, despite the fact that he was seen at\u000athe murder scene carrying a weapon.In prison, Andy eventually gains the respect of his inmates, including\u000athe influential prisoner 'Red' (Morgan Freeman) who 'gets things' for\u000athe prisoners. Later, Andy's knowledge of finance gains him popularity\u000awith the cruel prison guards and the Warden (Bob Gunton).The development of the friendship between Red and Andy is one of the\u000afocal points of the film as each man learns from the other. Several\u000asubplots are nicely intertwined into the film, none better than the\u000astory of old Brooks Hatlen (James Whitmore) and his release from\u000aprison. Having spent so much time at Shawshank, Brooks has become\u000a'institutionalised' i.e. so attached to prison that he cannot cope in\u000athe outside world. The sense of helplessness and solitude Brooks feels\u000awhen released is one of the films most genuinely emotional moments.The plot of the movie is solid, and while it encompasses some 20 years,\u000ait transitions well and never really feels slow. Credit for this must\u000ago to screenwriter Frank Darabont who nicely adapts Stephen King's\u000anovel to the big screen. The entire cast of the movie gives standout performances, led by\u000aRobbins. Robbins portrays Andy beautifully throughout the film,\u000aespecially with his facial expressions. His eyes are incredibly focused\u000aand haunting throughout and he often wears a smile on his face that\u000abelies his situation. Freeman does well as Red, playing him with\u000aconfidence and a sense of despair at the same time.Visually the film opts for a very grey tone that fits in with the\u000adreary feel of the prison and the prisoners. It also succeeds in\u000ahelping Andy to stick out, as his hope and demeanour contradict the\u000atone.The Shawshank Redemption is a truly beautiful film, easily one of the\u000abest of the 90's, filled with a great story, acting, emotion and a\u000aseries of memorable quotes.\u000a\u000a

V\u000a\u000aThere are some movies that come along that truly make a difference in\u000acinema and in peoples lives. In my opinion, this is one of those films.***spoilers*** (minor)The movie is about a man wrongfully accused of a crime. He is sentenced\u000ato life in prison. He ends up at Shawshank. A prison with a lot more\u000agoing on than what shows on the outside.There are quite a few things that make this film a masterpiece. One is\u000athe story and its qualities and values. Another is its amazing acting\u000aby all cast members in the film. The music was great and the\u000acinematography is creative. I don't believe there's a flaw in this\u000amovie.11/10 haha!\u000a\u000a

V\u000aSuperb acting and brilliant performances from Tim Robbins (Mystic\u000aRiver) and Morgan Freeman (Million Dollar Baby), who play as inmates,\u000aTim Robbins playing a man framed for the murder of his wife and the man\u000awho she had an affair with. The two inmates develop a friendship over\u000athe twenty odd years spent in the prison.This movie portrays an ugly, though bearable life in prison through the\u000a40s, 50s, and 60s.It's a strong piece on how far one will go to redeem himself, even if\u000athose things that must be redeemed are not by any means loathsome. See\u000ait if you haven't.\u000a

V\u000a\u000aMorgan Freeman as Red was truly inspired (even if the original story had a\u000awhite guy), they even used his son for the photo of the inmate as a young\u000aman...Tim Robbins as Andy DuFresne was marvelous understatement, Clancy brown as\u000athe on/off guard-friend of Andy was a good touch and a boost for his career\u000aapart from Starship Trooper... Now, Clancy is in HBO's "Carnivale" series\u000aand has his own website! As for the warden and "sisters,"  they were equally\u000awell-cast and the plot of the movie flowed despite what fan-sites may or may\u000anot nit-pick about.It is a tribute to perseverance and determination combined with patience and\u000aretribution couched in careful long-term planning that any true financial\u000ahead is accustomed to (remember, Andy was a Bank Manager, that knowledge\u000asaved him more than once)...Justice sometimes comes from beyond the law if you can wait long enough!\u000aThis picture is second after "Casablanca"!!\u000a

V\u000a\u000aWhen a movie makes you feel passionate and caring about murderers and\u000athieves, you know you are watching a good one. The Shawshank Redemption\u000amay very likely be the best movie i have ever seen. Not only because of\u000athe mentioned fact, but because it has the every basics a good film\u000aneeds. No movie making mistakes really are found through my eyes. This\u000amovie is rough, sad or even happy at moments. It makes you feel like\u000ayou were there experiencing what the characters do. Superb acting by\u000aTim Robbins and Morgan Freeman and Frank Darabont's direction too. The\u000aScreenplay is not really by any way too predictable and from the first\u000atwo minutes you know you are watching something special. I really can't\u000aof any movie that beats this one...\u000a\u000a

V\u000a\u000aI find it amazing that a film like this rates so highly on the IMDb Top\u000a250.It's not really a 'cinematic' film like LOTR or Star Wars- you don't\u000alook at it and go 'wow, what an amazing shot!' or 'how did they do\u000athat?'. Similarly, it's not chock-full of catch-phrases and snappy\u000adialogue like 'Pulp Fiction', 'Casablanca', or indeed memorable scenes\u000alike 'the Godfather'. Could anyone really talk about 'Shawshank' in the\u000away that people always discuss 'the Godfather' or 'LOTR'- "remember\u000athat moment when..."'Shawshank' isn't a big, spectacular film, and nor is it particularly\u000awitty.Instead, its success is entirely down to the quality of the story,\u000ahelped along by some very 'real' acting. I've now seen this film 4-5\u000atimes on odd occasions, and it just gets better every time. The story\u000ajust draws you in- you feel for the characters, and I love the way the\u000asurprise (well, surprise-ish) ending is perfectly believable without\u000aever being overtly signposted. I've heard that it's been much more\u000asuccessful on DVD and video than it was at the cinema- and I think that\u000aillustrates the type of movie it is.'Shawshank' is perhaps the best 'story' movie of recent times, and\u000aclearly deserves its place near the top of the IMDb rankings. Watch it\u000acurled up on the couch with a cup of coffee and a warm cosy wife...\u000a\u000a

V\u000aOverall, this is one of the finest films I've ever seen. Frank\u000aDarabont's masterful screenplay rendering of Stephen King's marginal\u000anovella brought every possible human emotion into play. And, every\u000aactor in the film did a superb job of translating this fiction into a\u000abelievable reality.On a scale from 1 to 100, I'd rate this movie a solid 99. Only one\u000athing was lacking in the film to raise that score to 100 ... but this\u000ais just a personal thing.POSSIBLE SPOILERS FOLLOWS:During his time in prison, Andy Dufresne learns the identity of the man\u000awho killed his wife - a man named Elmo Blatch. And, he learns enough\u000ainformation about Blatch to render him "trackable" by an investigator.\u000aIf 2 brief scenes had been added to the film, I'd have rated it a\u000aperfect film:ADDED SCENE #1 - Shortly before his escape, Andy is seen talking to\u000aanother inmate who gives him contact info for a person on the outside\u000awho does contract murder.ADDED SCENE #2 - Shortly before Red's release from prison, we see him\u000areading a newspaper story on the murder of an ex-con named Elmo Blatch.Between the time of Andy's escape and Red's release, there would have\u000abeen ample time for Andy to hire a private eye to track down Blatch\u000aand, afterward, hire a contract killer to kill him. Had I been Andy,\u000aI'd not have felt truly free of the suffering I'd endured in prison\u000aunless I knew the real killer got his just due. What Andy did to the\u000aWarden and Hadley is all well and good. But Blatch's death would settle\u000aall scores once and for all.\u000a

V\u000a\u000aA film I can watch over and over again - great storyline, beautifully\u000afilmed, top-notch acting - I always feel good about myself after\u000awatching it - there's hope for us all, even the most downtrodden\u000anonentities in this miserable world of ours! cinematic brilliance. Tim\u000aRobbins plays the lead character's role with such a classy\u000aunderstatement, & Morgan Freeman delivers a powerful and nuanced\u000aperformance that always lifts my soul as well as the great performance\u000aby all the supporting actors. I will be the first person to admit to\u000ahaving a slight eclectic taste in films, but this still ranks as one of\u000amy favourite films of all time. This truly is my definition of\u000acinematic brilliance - pity we don't get more films like this anymore.\u000a\u000a

Maybe it is time for me to\u000aunderstand it more ?".....these walls are funny. First you hate them. Then you get used to\u000athem. Enough time passes......you get so you depend on them.

It\u000awas my turn, that's all. I was in the path of the tornado. I just\u000adidn't expect the storm would last as long as it has.""I have to remind myself that some birds aren't meant to be caged.\u000aTheir feathers are just too bright. And when they fly away......the\u000apart of you that knows it was a sin to lock them up does rejoice."Andy was escape from his situation , Were we found our "Bible" and\u000a"Hammer" ?

V\u000a\u000aThe finest movie ever made, no question. If you can sit through this\u000aand not be moved by the sheer power of the story, performances and\u000aimagery you are not of this earth. I had already read the Stephen King\u000ashort story so the ending was no surprise but, guess what, it didn't\u000amatter ! That was just the cherry on top of a supreme masterpiece of\u000achocolate cake. This is the current yard stick by which all other\u000amovies should be measured against. The basic foundation of the film is\u000aso strong that all the other parts must have dropped into place with\u000a,seemingly, effortless ease. Hopefully one day something better will\u000acome along that will shift the goal posts once again. But for now, The\u000aShawshank Redemption is a more than worthy No. 1 on IMDb.\u000a\u000a

V\u000a\u000aAlthough the acting and directing was brilliant, the movie retained a\u000asomewhat unrealistic vibe. There is a very low chance that one will\u000afind as many civilized friends and people in a maximum security prison.\u000aThere was no sign of any violent or aggressive behavior in many of the\u000ainmates. The only thing that reflected real prison life were the cells\u000aand the sisters. Do not take this wrong. I loved the movie immensely.\u000aIt showed great imprisonment and in many ways was realistic. The acting\u000afrom Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman was perfect. The\u000ainstitutionalization of Brooks was very well portrayed. This movie had\u000amany great factors but not completely perfect. Overall I give this\u000amovie a 8.5.\u000a\u000a

V\u000a\u000aI have seen this movie dozens of times and thoroughly enjoy it each\u000atime. I've seen people commenting that this is simply a remake of an\u000aearlier film, and I don't see how one can come to that conclusion. The\u000aoriginal work was in the form of a novelette by Stephen King, part of\u000athe book "Different Seasons." You may also remember the movie "Stand By\u000aMe" which was adapted from that same book. Being that I am a fan of\u000aKing's work, I originally had high hopes for this movie. Often I am\u000adisappointed after having read a book and then going to see the film\u000aversion. Not so in this case. The filming location was here in Mansfield, Ohio, and the Reformatory\u000aused for much of the filming is an historical site which offers tours\u000a(it is also rumored to be haunted, but you can believe what you wish.)\u000a\u000a

V\u000a\u000aTo me this is one of the best films ever to grace the big screen, it\u000ahas the lot. I have seen the green mile as well but this film stands\u000ashoulders above it, It made me laugh, shed a tear and smile from ear to\u000aear, its truly a magnificent piece of cinema magic and i recommend this\u000afilm to everyone. Stephen King knows how to write suspense and horror\u000aand Frank Darabont knows how to direct. The characters are brilliant\u000aand there performances a sight to behold, Morgan freeman is brilliant\u000aas the man who can get you anything (in my eyes this is his finest\u000aperformance as an actor) The music as well adds to feel of the film and\u000amakes it an absolute pleasure to watch.I think the film will appeal to anyone and will carry on being a\u000aclassic for many many years to come, i don't think i have seen a film\u000athat has meant so much to me, it makes a change to watch a truly awe\u000ainspiring, golden film such as The Shawshank Redemption instead of the\u000anormal Hollywood action flick.\u000a\u000a

V\u000a\u000aThis is a love story, as old as the hills and yet with freshness that\u000acan only be given to us by great Celluloid actors such as Morgan\u000aFreeman and Tim Robbins. There are many examples of this throughout\u000aliterature and the adaptation of this from word to film is\u000abreathtaking.Andy and Red quite obviously have a deep and abiding love and respect\u000afor each other that transcends any feeling we might otherwise have\u000aabout the nature of their love, which incidentally is not a homosexual\u000alove.But let us not forget the other performances. How wonderful to see\u000aJames Whitmore as Brooks Hatlen and of course the brilliant William\u000aSaddler. It would have been too easy to slip into a prison melodrama\u000abut I think it was played perfectly by having Red narrate throughout,\u000athe two most wonderful pieces of narrative are where Andy plays Mozart\u000aover the prison loudspeakers and where Red sits in his cell, fearful\u000aand alone in the dark on the night of Andy's escape. 'Some things are just too beautiful.' 'Time draws out like a blade.'I guess that encapsulates the whole thing for me, because it's how time\u000adraws out while watching this beautiful picture. The blade cuts you to\u000athe heart because you long for Red and Andy to fulfil their hope.If I could, I would give this more than 10 out of 10 but I cannot.\u000aInstead I'll just say that this movie will give pleasure to people when\u000aplayed as an oldie in 50 years, because the story is timeless. No\u000aspecial effects, no fancy graphics, just a simple story, beautifully\u000atold and acted superbly.\u000a\u000a

V\u000a\u000aI first saw this movie when Channel 4 showed it in the UK in September\u000a2001. I had just come back from a wonderful holiday in Ohio, USA and\u000ahad never heard of this movie before. I just happened to flick to\u000achannel 4 and caught a glimpse of Morgan Freeman watching Tim Robbins\u000amake his entrance into Shawshank. I had missed the opening scene with\u000athe court case. My first impressions was that this was going to be a\u000atypical prison drama but I reached for the TV guide and read more about\u000ait. It starred Morgan Freeman who I remember from Along Came a Spider\u000aand Deep Impact and Tim Robbins who I have heard of but never seen on\u000ascreen before. The TV guide gave it a good rating and review so I\u000athought i might continue to watch it.In the opening scenes, I predicted possible rivalries between Andy and\u000aHeywood, however I was glad this was not the case as both characters\u000abecame well-liked throughout the film. I even thought there would be\u000atension between Andy and Red, but I was delighted that they became best\u000afriends throughout the movie. Along the way, I found the movie becoming\u000ainteresting with many plots running alongside each other and beautiful\u000aphotography. I held my breath when Hadley almost threw Andy off the\u000aroof and Morgan Freeman's story telling was first rate. Another scene that moved me was Andy playing the Mozart record and\u000agiving hope to all prisoners in Shawshank. I even went out to buy the\u000afantastic soundtrack with the song as well as the superb score by\u000aThomas Newman. I must say I was concerned when Andy got in trouble for\u000athat stunt, as I thought eventually the warden was going to help him\u000asolve his case. All the characters gave memorable performances and I\u000awas moved by Brooks taking his own life as he couldn't cope on the\u000aoutside. I was shocked when Tommy revealed Andy's innocence and equally\u000acurious when the warden refused to help him. Nothing prepared me for\u000athe way Andy escaped, I was so glad he did but felt for Red at the same\u000atime. I was thrilled when Red got his parole and just hoped he didn't feel\u000ainstitutionalised like Brookes. I thought Red blew it when he talked up\u000ato the parole board but had a chuckle when he finally left Shawshank.\u000aOther moving scenes were Red reading Andy's letter and making his way\u000athrough the fields surrounded with grasshoppers. The scene that took my\u000abreath away the most, was the shot of the bus as it made its way along\u000athe road with the brilliant sunlight, it looked just like the area\u000awhere I had just come from in Ohio, as well as Red and Brookes in Main\u000aStreet, Mansfield which I recognised. This film is long, but it\u000acertainly didn't seem that way to me, it is a movie you wish would go\u000aon for a bit more longer. I was stunned at the end, very moved, very\u000ahappy and almost in tears. This film is truly a work of art, probably\u000athe finest movie ever made with superb acting from all of the\u000acharacters, beautiful music, cinematography and so much better than the\u000anovel it is based on. I cannot believe it did not win any Oscars\u000adespite many nominations. It gives the viewer a sense of hope,\u000ahappiness and satisfaction all in one and anyone can see this movie\u000awhatever mood they are in. The movie is also funny, who can forget\u000aHadley with his, "if I hear anything more than a mousefart..." or Tommy\u000aexplaining when he got arrested and had to drop a TV set. This movie\u000amakes you feel great to be alive and as Red says this movie is "so\u000abeautiful it cannot be expressed in words". I bought the DVD for my\u000afamily to watch and their stunned silence at end confirmed my\u000asuspicions that they loved this movie too.Shawshank Redemption is going to be re-released in the UK in September\u000aand I would encourage anyone who hasn't seen it before to go and see it\u000aand hopefully feel the same way I felt when I first saw this movie.\u000aThere is so much to appreciate about this movie and everytime I see it\u000aagain, I love it even more.\u000a\u000a

Morgan Freeman has\u000aanother outstanding performance just like he had in Glory. The plot was as\u000agood as ever along with the dialouge. The music was nice and the atmosphere\u000ain the film felt like it was in the 40's, 50's, and 60's. Beautiful full of\u000atriumphant acting. This is Frank Darabont's best movie, even better than The\u000aGreen Mile which I also though was really good. This is one of the most\u000arecommended films of the 90's and you definitely will enjoy it. I mean come\u000aon guys, it even got in the 250 movies of all-time with a 9.0 and it got #2.\u000aExcellent film!!10/10!!\u000a

V\u000a\u000aA wonderfully made movie. The best thing about movie is it never looses\u000aits pace. Neither it gets fast nor it gets slow... Rightly placed at #2\u000aon IMDb.Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman makes a great pair in the movie.\u000aVillain, Bob Gluton, the Jailer performs his role very well. "Hope is\u000agood thing, probably one of the best thing, and no good thing ever\u000adies" is the central theme of the movie according to me. Calm, Placid banker Andrew Dufresene lives his life with hope without\u000aloosing his temper. and that's the movie is all about. Frank Darabont\u000adid an amazing job adapting from Stephen King's short story, and he\u000adeserves as much praise for it as possible. Nobody, not even my\u000afavourite writers such as the Coen brothers of Quentin Tarantino\u000a(partly for the fact that the first only writes comedies and the latter\u000aonly fares in blood spatter) could have achieved this amazing script,\u000awhich completely uplifts and spellbinds the viewer.\u000a\u000a

V\u000a\u000aWhen viewers see a young banker's character (Dufresne) convicted of a\u000agruesome murder, and later when they see him vindicate himself with the\u000ahelp of pure courage and hope, it evokes high emotions like triumph and\u000ahope. Each scene is skillfully written with viewers' perspective\u000aconsidered all through the film. Excellent work due to which Frank\u000aDarabont never need prove himself as a director again, because this one\u000agoes down in the history books as one of the best dramas ever written.Dufresne's character does what's on his mind says and never shows\u000afeelings of captivity while at Shawshank. The character is carved out\u000ameticulously displaying traits like intelligence and a mind determined\u000ato surviveMorgan Freeman ('Red') delivers a brilliant performance, deserving the\u000aAcademy Award that year which ultimately landed up with Tom Hanks\u000a('Forrest Gump').\u000a\u000a

V\u000a\u000aWell what can I say about this modern day classic that hasn't been told\u000aalready. It seems that most of us who have been lucky enough to watch\u000athis gem have been profoundly moved by this story. Not hearing anything\u000aabout the release of this film in '96, I rented this out without any\u000aidea what to expect, other than it was a prison drama. Now I love\u000aprison flicks and my favourites are Brubaker, Birdman of Alcatrez and\u000aStir Crazy, but after watching Shawshank Redemption I can say this is\u000aone of the best films ever made, and one of the very few movies that\u000amade me cry, and it takes a lot for me to shed a tear. I think the last\u000atime I cried was at my grandpas funeral, but that was a different\u000aemotion to the one I felt watching the Shawshank Redemption. The ending\u000awas filled with a great deal of satisfaction and hope that you rarely\u000aget in any film today. If you want to watch a film that has a story\u000athat covers human survival, struggle, bonding and hope and want to be\u000auplifted than this is the one to watch.\u000a\u000a

V\u000a\u000aAfter watching it a few time, this film has become my favourite! Each\u000atime I watch it I get more and more into the characters and I love it\u000aeven more. On the contrary of what you might think at first the plot is\u000anot about escaping from the prison. If it was only that it wouldn't be\u000aanything special as there have been a lot of films on that subject.\u000aWhat the film is about is the development of the characters themselves.I don't want to spoil it at all so I won't say any more about the\u000astory. All I can say is that I don't see to this day anything wrong\u000awith the film. Everything is brilliant from the acting to the music. I\u000adon't see how it is possible for somebody not to like it. I'd recommend\u000ait to anybody. It's one of those films which make you realize that you\u000adon't need CGI and big explosions to make a great film. But on the\u000acontrary big budget films are often the worst...\u000a\u000a

V\u000aWeather the person liked the movie or found it one of there favourite\u000amovies, they still have to admit that it is one of the greatest movies\u000aever\u000amade. There was so much symbolisim and moments that people will never\u000aforget\u000athat it will change the way they think what a good movie\u000ais.From the crow being set free to a thunderstorm and all the way to each and\u000aeverybody character, everything symbolized something in this movie. It\u000aisn't\u000ahard tofigure out what each and every one of them means though like Lord\u000aof\u000athe Flies and still makes you think even more then Lord of the Flies. To\u000aadd\u000aon Lord of the Flies was boring and this left the viewer on the edge of\u000athere seat thoughout the whole movie.Gasping, crying, laughing, heartbroken, thrilled are all some of the very\u000aemotions you'll feel in this movie then almost any other movie ever made.\u000aA\u000aconnection to the characters can eaisly be made many times thoughout the\u000amovie and you simply want to goodguys to win, even if they arn't goodguys\u000ain\u000asociety.The acting was amazing and perfect. Freeman delivered each and every\u000amonologue perfectly and professionally and put up as great as a\u000apreformance,\u000aif not better, then the movie Se7en. Robbins put up his best preformance\u000aanybody will probibly ever see him in making us connect to him and leaving\u000aa\u000amystery though half the movie weather he did shoot his wife or if he was\u000ainnosent. The Warden (Gunton) reaches to one of the great movie villians\u000aI've seen and the other bad guy Byron (Brown) puts up a preformance almost\u000aas great as Sgt. Heart from Full Medal Jacket. Tommy Williams at first\u000asight\u000amakes you seem like he's an elvis wannabe who seriously needs a life, but\u000aafter time when Robbins starts to work with him you start to feel for him\u000auntil your left in gasp at his last scene. Whitmore, who plays Brooks, has\u000athe viewer laughing, crying and screaming no at parts. The acting was\u000aperfect by all the major characters.What could be perfect acting without perfect writing and perfect dialouge\u000athough? Stephen King wrote a masterpeice and it was written into perfect\u000adialouge for this movie. Each and every monolouge was written to a\u000amasterpeice.The directing was just perfect also, enough said.To those that haven't seen this movie yet, I suggest to go see it a.s.a.p\u000ato\u000aknow what a perfect movie is.\u000a

V\u000a\u000aBut for me this is my second favorite film of all time.  Some just think\u000ait's too\u000asentimental in some areas, but I just don't agree. Sure, Frank Darabont\u000amay\u000ahave had a\u000aone time hit from a Stephen King novel, but what he was able to do with\u000athis\u000acharacter\u000adriven compelling story truly amazes me.  The movie gets me every time,\u000adraws me in\u000aand holds me there.  The use of voice-over is used so well in this movie\u000aand\u000athe range\u000aof emotion from Morgan Freeman's character just astonishes me.It follows twenty years of the Red character, played by Morgan Freeman and\u000ait chronicles\u000ahis life in a maximum-security prison and how one Andy Dufresne affects\u000ahis\u000alife played\u000abrilliantly by Tim Robbins.  Now, some may argue with me that it is Tim\u000aRobbins movie,\u000abut I would have to disagree since the character that goes through the\u000aacceptance and\u000athe change throughout the story is Red.  This is the one movie where you\u000acould really\u000ahave two leads, two protagonists, because they are both developed so well\u000aand their\u000arelationship is so fascinating to watch.I never tire of this movie.  The end monologue still makes me tear up\u000aevery\u000atime, and it\u000adoesn't matter if I watched the movie all the way through, or if I just\u000apopped in for the\u000alast few minutes on TBS.  It is such a masterfully told story of\u000aredemption\u000aand hope that\u000aif you love storytelling, you will love this movie.  I love movies from\u000aevery era, but this\u000aand Rushmore are my two favorite movies of all time.  Without a\u000adoubt!\u000a

V\u000a\u000a"The Shawshank Redemption" is one of those films that stays with you for\u000alife. This is a perfect display of modern film-making with beautiful\u000acinematography and wonderfully narrated by Morgan Freeman.The story is not an entirely original idea and appears to have borrowed\u000aconsiderably from other films (notably "Escape from Alcatraz") but this\u000adoes\u000anot seem to matter, since the most intriguing part of this film is HOW the\u000astory is told. With the help of some excellent editing and a heart-warming\u000anarration by Morgan Freeman (of course, not forgetting a very-well-written\u000ascript by director Frank Darabont), the story unfolds in such a manner\u000athat\u000awill keep you entirely engulfed in the film from start to\u000afinish.There is hardly a fault to be found with this film. The well-fleshed out\u000aand\u000abelievable characters are exquisitely portrayed on the screen,\u000aparticularly\u000aby Morgan Freeman and Tim Robbins who work brilliantly together. The\u000ascript\u000ais consistently paced but never rushed, allowing the events to unfold.\u000aDespite the runtime almost reaching two and a half hours, the film never\u000adrags, nor does it feel too long. The cinematography is an absolute treat,\u000awith Roger Deakins superbly capturing the colours of mid-20th century\u000aAmerica. Perhaps the only flaws that can be found with this fantastic work\u000aare the apparent lack of ageing of characters, despite the story taking\u000aplace over almost twenty years, and the slightly unoriginal (in parts)\u000aplot.\u000aHowever, neither of these 'flaws' detract from what this film is - an\u000aoutstanding piece of storytelling that captures the audience with every\u000aimage."The Shawshank Redemption" is a perfect display of storytelling and is\u000abeautifully uninhibited by the sorts of visual effects that unnecessarily\u000aspoil so many films today. But the most important thing about this film is\u000athat it is believable and extremely watchable. It is easy for the audience\u000ato connect with the characters, and thus - thanks to the excellent acting\u000aby\u000aRobbins and Freeman in the lead roles - we can feel for them and respond\u000aaccordingly."The Shawshank Redemption" - as a masterpiece in storytelling - may never\u000abe\u000asurpassed. Few films get as close to perfection as this one does; the\u000aacting\u000aand cinematography, in particular, are absolute joys. Two thumbs up to\u000aFrank\u000aDarabont and his crew for creating such a wonderful masterpiece that will\u000alive in our hearts forever.***** out of *****\u000a

V\u000a\u000aSucked into this movie by his earnest persona, I watched despite the\u000a(apparent) certainty that he would live out his whole life in prison for a\u000acrime he says he did not commit : a depressing thought but a totally\u000aupbeat\u000amovie as his character Andy moves from surviving to molding the lives of\u000aothers in a positive way. Told from the viewpoint of fellow prisoner\u000arecounting his experiences with Robbins' character (Morgan Freeman -\u000aanother\u000adelight to watch) This movie, like its protagonist, is a champ! Watch this\u000amovie! I've seen it four times and still channel-stop on it.(PS Be sure to\u000ahiss at Bob Gunton as the truly evil and hypocritical warden! A real\u000acontrast to Andy's good nature and philanthropy.)\u000a

V\u000a\u000aI would only put this movie behind the LOTR trilogy (I consider them one\u000amovie). It is a great tale and even though you know something good will\u000ahappen, you don't know exactly how, though when looking back it was pretty\u000aclear. I value movies by how entertaining and captivating they are. This\u000aone\u000awas both. Many people like to put on their "film-maker" hats too much.\u000aThis\u000amovie doesn't really show great symbolism or tricky camera work. Its just\u000aa\u000avery good story with very good acting. Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman are\u000aunreal, and all the supporting characters (Brooks, the prison guards,\u000aetc.)\u000amake the film complete. It took my a long time to see this movie, even\u000athough its on TNT and TBS like every weekend. I must say I was thrilled.\u000aJust excellent. 10/10 easy.\u000a

And if i do i will\u000aprobably look at them funny and ask what is wrong with them. Tim Robbins and\u000aMorgan Freeman are both excellent in this "innocent man wants his freedom"\u000amovie. This film is about friendship, freedom and justice. A man is sent to\u000aShawshank prison for something he didn't commit. Here he meets a man who\u000awill become his best friend. They stick up for each other against the\u000acorrupt prison system and other inmates. You really have to see it to\u000aunderstand how fantastic this movie is. I rate this movie\u000a10\u000a

V\u000a\u000aBefore you start reading my comments on this movie, please keep in mind\u000athere are very minor spoilers, so if you haven't seen it.what are you\u000athinking, go and watch the movie, you won't be disappointed.This is the first time I've written a comment about a movie on this\u000awebsite,\u000abut I think it will be my first of many as I have so many favourite movies\u000aI\u000alove to share my opinion about on the message boards.I only just stumbled across 'The Shawshank Redemption' about a year ago, I\u000ahad noticed it was ranked number 2 and thought I'd give it ago. I've heard\u000apeople talking about it and how great it is, so I bought the movie and I\u000awatched it. I admit that I had to watch it twice before I fell in awe of\u000athis movie, but now it's become one of my favourites.This movie is about hope. There is nothing set in stone. Someone may be\u000aable\u000ato take away everything you have in life, but whatever you think, whatever\u000ayou feel they can never take away your thoughts, they can never take away\u000ayour hope and that's what happened with Andy. He may have sunk to the\u000abottom\u000aof the hole, but he never gave up hope that he would get out.This is a true masterpiece and it is well written, well acted, well\u000adirected, well it's just brilliant. Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman produce\u000aa\u000agreat friendship in this movie. It may not have won the Oscars, as it lost\u000ato another great movie, but it certainly left an imprint in the movie\u000aworld\u000aand to me.One more thing, watch out for James Whitmore as Brooks, he's sure to break\u000ayour heart and move you to a place you don't go too often.Remember, if you didn't like it the first time, give it another chance and\u000awatch it again, I promise you, you won't be disappointed you will notice\u000alittle things and the scenes that you have overlooked. It's sure to turn\u000ayour head and mesmerize you.\u000a\u000a

V\u000a\u000athis is one of the greatest movies ever made. I have watched this movie\u000aover\u000atwo dozen times. I never tire of seeing "Andy Get Them". the lack of\u000aawards\u000athat this movie recieve was a true travesty. Tim Robbins performance ranks\u000aas quite possibly his best and considering who we are talking about that\u000ais\u000asaying alot. Morgan Freeman talent overshadow the fact that he was not\u000alike\u000ahis character in the book. The rest of the cast though for the most part\u000anameless is extraordinary. Chief among them though is Ron Perlman. There\u000acant be anyone who didnt feel a great swell of joy when they heard the\u000achess\u000apiece go through the poster. This is one of the greatest cinema moments i\u000ahave ever witnessed. This film taps into you and elicts a great emotion.\u000aThis is something few movies have or ever will do, but it is what makes\u000athis\u000aone of the greatest films ever made.\u000a

V\u000a\u000aMy Rating: ***1/2 out of ****. SpoilersIn many ways, I am more than a little shocked at the overwhelming popularity\u000aof The Shawshank Redemption. I am not in anyway saying that it is a bad\u000afilm, in fact its a great film. However, I never thought Shawshank would\u000aappeal to so many people. It just seems odd that it has received over\u000a112,000 votes (More than the Godfather) and it is #2 on the Imdb top 250\u000alist. I do not think it deserves this high position but it is nice to see\u000athe film get alot of notice.Shawshank deserves high marks in these categories: Directing, Acting,\u000aCinematography, and Writing. This was the debut feature for Frank Darabont\u000aand he chooses to let Shawshank unravel at a slow pace. This is the perfect\u000achoice for the film. It moves slow but it is nevertheless compelling. There\u000ais only one time when the slow pace actually interferes with the film.Darabont also gets some highly impressive from his cast. Tim Robbins gives a\u000astrong, subdued performance. Morgan Freeman, who was nominated for a Best\u000aActor Oscar, does an equally strong job here. The chemistry between them is\u000aeffective too. As strong as the two leads are, they do not outshine the supporting cast.\u000aAll of them are excellent but two of them deserve to be singled out. James\u000aWhitmore gives a brilliantly moving performance. Bob Gunton also deserves\u000amention as the warden in charge of Shawshank. Cinematographer Roger Deakins should be given a lot of credit. He finds the\u000aperfect mood for the film. Shawshank is not a colorful place at all. He\u000acreates a dreary atmosphere that fits the film perfectly. There alot of uses\u000aof the color, gray that is used to create this atmosphere.I have heard a couple of complaints that the film gets a little preachy at\u000atimes. I cannot find where it does. In my opinion, Shawshank Redemption is a\u000awell-written film. There are numerous memorable quotes.Shawshank does have one flaw. I think it begins to drag near the end. This\u000ahappens after Morgan Freeman is released from prison. These moments are the\u000aonly times when the slow pace interferes with the film.While I do not think the film deserves its high spot on the 250 list, it is\u000aa compelling and moving film. Shawshank does enough things right to overlook\u000aits sluggish ending. I recommend the film to everyone.  \u000a

V\u000a\u000aThis is a very fine movie that was unfortunately somewhat overlooked when it\u000awas first released. Word of mouth and critical acclaim has resulted in the\u000amovie becoming one of the best known and loved films of recent times.The story tells of the imprisonment of Andy Dufresne (Robbins) at the harsh\u000aShawshank prison. Gradually over time he befriends Red (Freeman) who is the\u000afixer in the prison who can get hold of any items at a price. Andy channels\u000ahis frustration into making things better at the prison. The smallest\u000aachievement is celebrated and used as impetus for the next challenge. The\u000afilm should really make the viewer treasure the things that we all take for\u000agranted on a day to day basis. The other interesting aspect of the film is\u000athe institutionalisation as portrayed with Brooks. he has been in prison for\u000aso long he cannot (and does not want to) survive on the outside.\u000a9/10\u000a

V\u000a\u000aIt's sad it's uplifting. It's right it's wrong. but most of all it's the\u000agreatest film of our time and everyone should have this in their\u000acollection.\u000aEverything from the heartache that tim robbins character faced to the\u000apower\u000aof friendship with one mans struggle agains a wall of oppression he made\u000ahis\u000apath to the top and he fool them all. This is with out a doubt the\u000agreatest\u000athing I have ever watched and I feel that everyone should know about it\u000aand\u000awatch it at least 20 times, for there are some valuable lessons to be\u000alearnt\u000abut dont take my word for it go there and see for yourself. This film set\u000athe marker for what prision films aspire to. These guys should be knighted\u000aand given the key to the world never mind the city.\u000a

I have heard\u000aliterally hundreds of people talk in glowing terms about this movie and\u000amention it as their favorite, and I'm not even conducting a poll. I was\u000ablown away when I saw it ten years ago in the theater and to me it's still\u000athe best movie I have ever seen. Best ever? Who cares. The votes on this\u000asite speak for themselves.

V\u000a\u000aThis perfect prison drama has everything except women.  Tim Robbins gives\u000aa\u000atruly majestic performance and should've been nominated for an Oscar\u000aalongside co-star Morgan Freeman (he's good, too).  It's a whole lot\u000abetter\u000athan other prison movies you see nowadays.  The film is honest, deep, and\u000ashows that you can find hope in the most unlikely of places.  I would give\u000athis movie ten thumbs up if I had ten thumbs.  But since I don't, I'll\u000ajust\u000agive it two.  I wish Stephen King could write more honest stories like\u000athis\u000aone.  Remember, this movie came beforere 'The Green Mile', and everyone\u000aknows classics are always better.\u000aIt's nice to see that Hollywood can produce movies that aren't complete\u000agarbage. \u000a

V\u000a\u000aThe Shawshank Redemption is perhaps the best movie that I have seen. It was\u000aa deep and enjoyable movie experience. I would give it 5 out of 5 stars. It\u000anot only had very good actors, but I also thought that it had and excellent\u000ascreenplay. Tim Robbins, I hope did not get typecast from playing that role\u000aas well as Morgan Freeman. Overall, it is a movie at it's best. It is\u000acertainly to be commended. I have not seen a finer example of anything\u000arealistic. From start to finish, it was non stop enjoyment for me. The\u000arelationships between the characters were very high as far as "good\u000achemistry". Morgan Freeman also did a very outstanding job of being the\u000anarrator of the story. He made it very realistic. It certainly is to be\u000aamong the top 10 best movies ever made.\u000a

V\u000aIn this moving and dramatic portrayl of the imprisonment of an\u000ainfluencial man (Tim Robbins) in Shawshank prison. This man builds up\u000astrong\u000arelationships and is a benefit to the lives of many in the prison.Tim Robbins plays his character with superb acting, backed up by an\u000aequally amazing supporting cast. The story takes the main character,\u000aDufrain, and his friends on a journey through the rigures of prison life.Wonderfully directed and produced, this film topped the box office\u000achart\u000aand was quite rightly rated extreemly highly among imdb users when it\u000afirst\u000acame out. This fantastic film has new suprises at every corner. Do not\u000amiss\u000ait! \u000a

V\u000a\u000aThe greatest travesty ever to happen at the Oscars, I feel, was the fact\u000athat Forrest Gump totally dominated this film cum Oscar night. For one\u000ayear,\u000atwo at a stretch, people still felt Forrest Gump to be the superior film,\u000abut now nearly everyone knows the truth.The Shawshank Redemption is a truly wonderful film. Having two fine actors\u000ain the leading roles at the top of their game is not bad, having two fine\u000aactors is not bad, full stop. This film was made by the chemistry between\u000aFreeman ( Red ) and Robbin ( Andy ) and their respective characters. There\u000awere some great small roles in the film, none more so I felt than Gil\u000aBellows part as the cocky small-time thief, Tommy, who turns out to be a\u000avery important character in the film.On the writing front, Stephen King isn't known for his screenplays, let\u000aalone a non-horror work, but he delivered a wonderful story for this film.\u000aIt is basically a story of friendship and hope, but it is not like other\u000asoppy buddy-buddy films. It is violent at times and touching at others, it\u000ais basically a fantastic piece of work.\u000a

Very good movie indeed, but I view it as just another\u000awell done prison movie.  It goes in line of "The Green Mile" in which it\u000astirs your soul and moves you.  \u000a

V\u000a\u000aUpon seeing The Shawshank Redemption, I realized that a movie can be so\u000agood\u000aand so powerful that it can keep you in awe for a long time. I saw\u000aShawshank\u000ayears ago and have probably seen it fifty times since then and not once\u000ahave\u000aI been bored or uninterested. I have been blown away by this movie since\u000athe\u000afirst time that I saw it. There is truly no movie better that The\u000aShawshank\u000aRedemption. There is no better story and there is certainly no better\u000atheme.\u000aRedemption, hope and friendship have been displayed in the finest form\u000aleaving you filled with the two former. Truly, the greatest film ever\u000amade.\u000a

V\u000a\u000aWhile the movie truly is one of the best ever made in terms of the impact\u000ais\u000ahas had on so many people (IMDB #2), I hope people understand that in this\u000acase, most of the power comes from the story, the rest from the\u000apresentation. I was a Stephen King fan when i was young and this story was\u000aone of the reasons.The flaw in the movie comes right at the end. The movie simply goes on for\u000aabout 30 seconds too long. Storytelling is also about knowing how to end a\u000astory and King got it right in the book. The movie's ending does not\u000acontain\u000athe same wonderous, makes-you-think impact that King's does and that's a\u000ashame because for me the movie is now less than perfect when it actually\u000adeserves 10/10 on its own merit. Oh, what it could have been\u000a!!Another King story ends well, Firestarter, and they did get it right in\u000athe\u000amovie. But Firestarter isn't as good as "The Shawshank Redemption".\u000aNothing\u000amuch is.\u000a

V\u000a\u000aA truly great film. Probably the best prison movie ever made. Even thought\u000ait's the only prison movie I've ever seen. Anyway, I think this movie\u000adeserves the rating it has on IMDB. Now to get Saving Private Ryan's rating\u000aup there. Okay I'll stay on topic. Morgan Freeman is at his very best in\u000athis movie playing the "man who can get stuff for you" or Red. Tim Robbins\u000awas also great as Andy Dufrense. Not only was the acting great, but so was\u000athe story. The message here was one that I will never forget. But I won't\u000atell you what it is, you'll just have to watch the movie. 10/10. As I always\u000asay to all my favorite movies, great job. \u000a

V\u000a\u000aI would agree with others that this movie isn't anything particularly\u000aspecial. It certainly doesn't rank up among Godfather or Casablanca IMHO.\u000aBut it is a good movie, it has it's heart in the right place, and works on a\u000alot of different levels. Morgan Freeman is perfect and Tim Robbins is\u000aservicable as two people who meet in prison and develop a friendship. I also\u000afound the film to have good re-watchability value.I found this movie to be flawed in two main areas. First, time simply does\u000anot seem to pass at all in prison. No effort is put into making the\u000acharacters age at all, even though twenty years passes over the course of\u000athe film. The second is that the ending occasionally strays into tedium as\u000athe film struggles to get every payoff in. But the heartfelt message is not\u000aforgotten, nor is the depiction (although obviously sanitized) version of\u000aprison life.All in all, this is Hollywood, and considering Hollywood films, this is one\u000aof the better ones.8/10\u000a

I remember seeing only a few moments of it on TV, when I\u000awas twelve.  I rented it, and found myself ASTOUNDED by the magnitude of\u000aits\u000aemotion.  I didn't cry, but I felt as though someone had pierced my heart\u000awith an arrow.  It felt good!!!  I have never seen anything in my life so\u000aaffecting.  This is my favorite film ever!  Nothing will ever beat this as\u000amy number one.  I love Citizen Kane, and I think it is "the best film ever\u000amade" on a critical standpoint, But I love this just a little bit more.\u000aCinematography, music, writing, directing, acting.  EVERYTHING PERFECT!\u000aIt\u000ais spectacular.  I will never forget "The Shawshank Redemption".\u000a

V\u000a\u000aI really do think that this movie has earned a place in the illustrious\u000ahalls of Imdb at the number two position.\u000aThis movie gives you more each time you see it.  It is not an exercise of\u000athe mind, rather a true introspection of the spirit, that reveals to each\u000aof\u000aus what we can only hope to become.However, I do think that Fraggle Rock deserves a place at number\u000afour.\u000a

V\u000a\u000aHow the hell Forest "Dam" Gump won best picture over this Gem of a movie,\u000ais\u000atotaly beyond me. It just shows how the critics and hollywood itself can\u000aget\u000ait sooo wrong sometimes. Thankfully like all great movies that often sleep\u000aat the box office.. true quality shines through,  and its great to see\u000athat\u000athe public recognise and all round great movie, regardless of what some\u000aoverpayed over inteligent critic would have them believe. For me it's the\u000akind of film you just don't want to end.. it's 2 and half hour long but it\u000anever drags, and when it ends, you know you've seen "A GREAT MOVIE" and\u000ayou\u000afeel full like you've just dined at the Ritz\u000a

V\u000a(very minor spoilers) I had to add this to my previous comment after\u000areading a more recent review here on IMDb. The review stated that\u000aChristian fundamentalists hated the movie because it showed the true\u000ahypocrisy of the Warden, along with his oft quoted Bible and the\u000astitched verse on his wall "Judgment cometh..." behind which he kept\u000ahis ill gotten gains. But I am a Christian conservative who loved this\u000amovie for that very reason. It shows that God looks at the heart. The\u000aWarden had a wicked heart, regardless of what came out of his mouth and\u000awhat he hung on his wall - and clearly his judgment did come! Andy was\u000akind at heart, offering friendship and help to any who would accept it,\u000aand well, he got what he deserved in the end. When Red gave up trying\u000ato pretend something before the parole board, trying to tell them what\u000athey wanted to hear and instead just spoke the truth, he gets his\u000aparole. Both Andy and Red refuse to give in to the despair of prison\u000alife - instead doing what they can to bring a bit of beauty to the\u000aprison. Andy never loses his humanity, and helps Red find his again.\u000aThey keep hoping till the very end, but don't just sit around waiting\u000afor justice, but actively seek it. The ending makes the movie.My husband will not watch it - having a strong aversion to "prison\u000aflicks" but I have seen it several times, and reading some of these\u000acomments has made me want to see it again.It is one of my all time favorite movies - I never get tired of\u000awatching it since I went out and bought the DVD. The first 30-45\u000aminutes are full of heavy language and prison violence, but that only\u000amakes the contrast between those who have given up their humanity and\u000athose who have held onto it. Not appropriate for young children, but\u000afor those able and willing to look at the reality of life - it is\u000abeautiful!\u000a

V\u000a\u000aThis movie really moved me when I first saw it on TV. A great plotline,\u000aactors with perfect acting skills and the impressive reflection of social\u000aproblems and humanity.\u000aThe most amazing point is that I can barely find an actress throughout\u000athe\u000aplay.

V\u000aThis was on sale for £5 so I had to buy it after all the rave reviews\u000aI'd heard from everybody. In hindsight, I only wish I had bought it\u000asooner. This film is a fascinating tale of a mans journey through\u000aprison life, wonderfully illustrating his relationships with fellow\u000ainmates and staff. Stephen King had his freshest idea which knocks\u000asocks off all his other work including Stand By Me (adaptation from his\u000anovel The Body).Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman give flawless performances in the lead\u000aroles and are supported superbly by the rest of the cast including Bob\u000aGunton, William Sadler, Clancy Brown, Gil Bellows and Mark Rolston.\u000aIronically for me, Mark Rolston plays one of the worst characters in\u000ahistory in my opinion (Drake from Aliens) so in his evil role, it had a\u000agreat effect on me. The characters are key to this film as they narrate\u000athe story and move the film forward so credit must go to the casting\u000adirectors for picking such an effective cast. It is understandable why\u000aFreeman was Oscar nominated for this role as he is near perfect. The\u000asmile he gives at the end if the film is more valuable than a thousand\u000awords.The plot to this is superb; an innocent man seeking freedom, a redeemed\u000aman seeking peace and a hideously corrupt prison are all elements of a\u000anicely complicated plot which, at the same time, is easy to follow. The\u000aevents in the final quarter of the film are so intelligently conceived,\u000awell done and convincing, that the film just falls perfectly in to\u000aplace. A masterpiece of a film.Films like this are important because the film industry often ignores\u000athemes of hope in the wake of terror. Shawshank is an inspirational\u000atale of a man's honesty and bravery against a hideously corrupt and\u000abrutal system. This is why Shawshank Redemption is still talked about\u000aand adored by all who have seen it and why it will always be talked\u000aabout. Cool to see an IMDb segments in the DVD featurette!\u000a

V\u000a\u000aFor years this was one of my favorite movies that I found myself watching\u000aover and over again. Then, I went out I bought the DVD when it was\u000areleased\u000aand haven't watched it since. They chose just the right actors to play\u000aeach\u000aof their roles. Tim Robbins best movie by far and another one to add to\u000aFreeman's resume, not that he needs one. Bob Gunton, who might not be as\u000awell known as he should be, playing a great warden with his usual\u000apersonality that fits in perfect with this flick. If there is anyone who\u000ahas\u000aNOT seen this film, I recommend at least giving it a chance by renting it.\u000aYou are really missing out on something special.\u000a

V\u000a\u000aThis is one of those rare, rare movies that almost forces you to stop what\u000ayou're doing and watch it through to its conclusion each time you come\u000aacross it on WTBS or one of the other movie stations, even though you've\u000aseen it many times and you own it on both VHS and DVD.  Put succinctly,\u000ait's\u000aremarkable.  There have been many comments of praise on the movie as a\u000awhole\u000aand on the uplifting and thrilling ending (beginning with Andy's escape\u000aand\u000acontinuing through to his reunion with Red) and so anything I might add\u000awould be superfluous, but just I've got to single out the scene on the\u000arooftop where Andy ingratiates himself with the brutish and sadistic chief\u000aguard by showing him how he can avoid paying taxes on his inheritance.\u000aIt's\u000athe turning point of prison life for Andy and ultimately Red, and the\u000ascene\u000ais flawlessly written and executed.\u000a

V\u000a\u000aThe Shawshank Redemption (1994/Frank Darabont)\u000a**** out of ****"I have to remind myself that some birds aren't meant to be caged. Their\u000afeathers are just too bright. And when they fly away, the part of you that\u000aknows it was a sin to lock them up DOES rejoice. Still, the place you live\u000ain is that much more drab and empty that they're gone. I guess I just miss\u000amy friend."- Red (Morgan Freeman)This is the ultimate story of friendship. It tells the story of Andy\u000aDufresne (Tim Robbins), a young hot-shot banker who is railroaded for a\u000adouble murder in 1947. He is then sent to Shawshank Prison, where he soon\u000abefriends Red (Morgan Freeman), a man 'who can get things'. The movie spans\u000aalmost 20 years, and shows the growing friendship of these two men. Joining\u000athem is the old pro James Whitmore as Brooks, who does a great job as a man\u000awho "lives in fear". This is the best "feel good" movie of all time, and one of the best of the\u000a90's. It is flawless in a departments. It is based on a short story by\u000aStephen King, and is masterfully put onto the big screen. Freeman turns in\u000ahis best performance, and has many great lines as the stories narrator. In\u000afact, the film is well written and projects deep meanings of triumph and\u000ahope. Many critics have complained that the film is too long. Whomever truly\u000abelieves this can not call themselves a film critic. The film is slowly\u000apaced to show the long growing friendship of Andy and Red. It's pacing is\u000awhat makes it so real and excellent.SPOILERS: The ending is the best part of the film, and has probably the best\u000ascene in motion picture history: Andy's Escape. The film's music plays a big\u000apart in this scene, showing Andy's determination and endurance. You end up\u000arooting for him all the way. Another great scene is when Andy talks to Red\u000aafter he gets out of the "hole". Red reveals his weaknesses and fears, but\u000aAndy has hope.This film is a masterpiece of story telling, and should not be missed. Like\u000aI said in the beginning of the review, not only is the film flawless in all\u000adepartments, it excels in every way. You will believe in\u000ahope.-30-\u000a

V\u000a\u000aI was one of the many movie-goers who saw The Shawshank\u000aRedemption without being aware it was a Stephen King story, and\u000aso had the pleasure of seeing the movie without prior\u000aexpectations.The Shawshank Redemption is, without doubt, the finest\u000aconversion from book to film of a Stephen King story. Perhaps\u000abecause 'Rita Hayworth and the Shawshank Redemption' (which\u000acan be found in the Different Seasons book) is short, and thus has\u000aless for the film makers to put on the screen.Morgan Freeman and Tim Robbins deliver faultless performances\u000aas a hardened criminal (Freeman) and a man pleading innocence\u000a(Robbins), and the supporting cast of criminals and guards does\u000aa brilliant job of creating a world full of repentent criminals, cruel\u000awardens, and (without spoiling anything) 'less than friendly'\u000acons.What makes The Shawshank Redemption such a memorable\u000amovie is that it manages to create characters that the viewer loves,\u000ain a scenario and location where you'd never expect to find them.\u000aThese characters, despite their faults, have you hoping for the best\u000abut fearing for the worst for the entirety of the movie. Fans of King\u000awill no doubt be familiar with the way he can create such\u000acharacters, but the feat is rarely carried over onto the\u000ascreen.I like a movie that can stimulate emotion in me, and The\u000aShawshank Redemption did that. There are things to laugh at,\u000ascenes to flinch away from (although nothing like American History\u000aX), and most importantly for the film, things that make you want to\u000acry in a mixture of disbelief and shock.A brilliant movie, and worthy of the Oscar nomination it got and\u000aprobably should have won.See if you liked: American History X, The Green Mile, Life is\u000aBeautiful.\u000aStrengths: Brilliant cast, excellent story-telling, King's usual\u000aattention to realism.\u000aWeaknesses: None.\u000aMy Rating: 9.5 out of 10\u000a

V\u000a\u000aI have nothing but praise for THE SHAWSHANK REDEMPTION.  It is touching,\u000ahigh-spirited and full of motivation.  Tim Robbins plays a banker who is\u000awrongly convicted of the murders of his wife and her lover.  He is sentenced\u000ato life in prison and eventually befriends another lifer (played by Morgan\u000aFreeman in a powerful role) who has just been denied parole.  It may sound\u000alike a simple story, but Frank Darabont's direction, along with endearing\u000aperformances and a cheerful climax, makes the film so energetic and magical.\u000a THE SHAWSHANK REDEMPTION is a breath-taking masterpiece.5 out of 5\u000a

Freedom,  innocence,\u000aaging, prejudice, masculinity.  My only "but" is this:  Having seen the\u000atelevision show 'OZ,' it seems that in prison the lines of good and bad,\u000afriend or foe, are very blurred.  In this movie, they seem a little too\u000acut-and-dry.  Other than that, I can't think of a single other critique, nor\u000acan I come up with any other words to do it justice.  If I had to pick from\u000aeither this film or "The Godfather" only, it'd be this, hands\u000adown!\u000a

V\u000aOnce again, a DVD purchase gives me an excuse to write about a film I\u000afirst saw years ago - and, by happy chance, it's a truly magnificent\u000apiece of work.Stephen King's work, itself uneven in quality, also has a spotty\u000ahistory when transferred to the screen, whether in the form of a movie\u000aor a TV drama. Neither version of "The Shining" was very good, while\u000a"The Stand" was converted into a TV drama that flowed better than the\u000anovel itself, but was unable wholly to overcome or conceal that book's\u000avery real flaws.This film is based on King's short story "Rita Hayworth and Shawshank\u000aRedemption" - a good story that makes a superb film. It DOES drag\u000asomewhat in places, but what else can you expect in a film describing\u000aevents that stretch over decades, but are confined to a very small\u000aphysical space? For the rest, the acting is flawless, the music is\u000asubtle and appropriate, while the photography and script are both\u000aexcellent. I particularly liked the characterization and portrayal of\u000arelationships - not just the Robbins-Freeman interaction, but also the\u000aother characters, even the minor ones, who cross our field of vision as\u000athe film progresses.There are a number of enjoyable high points and thought-provoking low\u000apoints along the way - not too many, that would destroy the film's main\u000aimpact - and the conclusion rates as one of the most gratifying I've\u000aever seen in a movie. In short, unless you demand lots of action of the explosions and chases\u000atype, you're going to be enthralled by this one.Rating: 10/10 - the only film I've seen so far to deserve this rating.\u000a

V\u000a\u000adoes it come off as a great movie? Perhaps, but I still think that other\u000athan the fact that this movie's premise was a ripoff of ESCAPE FROM ALCATRAZ\u000a(made in 1979..a full 14 years before Shawshank).. I guess it's still not\u000abad. It is an  interesting story, albeit not entirely true, or false. Yes,\u000athere was a prisoner who dug his way out of an alleged impenetrable prison.\u000aYes, there was the usual bad warden who could make your life miserable and\u000adid when you did not tow the line. What  Stephen King did was change the\u000atimeline(1950's) and the digging. You never see Tim Robbins character\u000adigging! You get an  idea he might try it but upon first viewing the movie,\u000ayou really have no clue except the feeling he is up to something!  He  is\u000ajust to smart not to have a plan. Afterall,  he is the prison accountant and\u000apersonal investment broker! So in the end, the  audience was just as\u000asurprized as the warden at the discovery of his amazing escape!In "Escape from Alcatraz" we see the digging and the entire plan unfold..so\u000awhat is left for us to enjoy is the satisfaction of  seeing that jerk of a\u000awarden get what's coming when the prisoners break out of the Rock! Stephen\u000aKing created a great piece  of work and the director made it work as great\u000acinema. So it doesn't come off entirely as a remake of a similar type of\u000aprison  break movie but a character study of 2 men who desperately want out\u000aand some who don't. But I thought you all ought to  know where the original\u000astory of digging thru a prison wall came from. To me the twist was Tim had to swim thru 500 yards of crap and Clint\u000aEastwood had to swim across a freezing San Francisco bay! Whereas Shawshanks\u000acharacters end up free, happy and in paradise, we never will know if the\u000aAlcatraz prisoners survived  the swim across the freezing SF bay..it's still\u000a\u000a

V\u000a\u000aI have seen many films in my 38 years of living but none has moved me\u000amore\u000athan this film. This is my all-time favorite film. The scene where I\u000aalways\u000aemotionally break down is at the very end of the film when Red says "I\u000ahope\u000athe pacific is as blue as it has been in my dreams." The ending of this\u000afilm\u000ais as good as any film ever. After all Andy and Red had been through,\u000athey\u000aget what they deserve, (as every person in the film does) a good life.\u000aThe\u000amoral of the film is "Hope is a good thing, maybe the best of things, and\u000ano\u000agood thing ever dies. I suggest everyone who reads this comment go and\u000avote\u000afor this film as #1 in the "Top 250" (It's already #2, but it deserves to\u000abe\u000a#1).\u000a

V\u000a\u000aThe Shawshank Redemption is one of the greatest movies of all time.  It\u000adoesn't have high budget effects, dramatic car chases or elaborate plots.\u000aHowever it is a fantastic story of the inmates at Shawshank Prison, more\u000aspecifically Andy Dufrasne (Tim Robbins) and 'Red' (Morgan Freeman).  The\u000areason I believe this film is the greatest is down to its ability to\u000adeliver\u000aa brilliant story at a realistic level, with developing friendships,\u000aloveable characters and despicable villians.The tag line for this movie states that "Fear can hold you prisoner, hope\u000acan set you free" and that is what this film is all about, hope.  The\u000abelief\u000athat if you have a dream, hope can help you realise it, no matter how\u000ableak\u000athe situation may seem.  Everytime I watch this movie, I become immersed\u000aby\u000ait to a point where it seems that I am there with the main characters at\u000aeach and every step.  I watch the credits roll knowing that I have been\u000atouched by something beautiful, knowing that I have been told a tale that\u000ainspires any hopes and dreams of my own.  The Shawshank Redemption is\u000awithout a doubt the greatest movie of all time.\u000a

V\u000a\u000aThe famous British movie reviewer Barry Norman said "Your favourite film\u000amust be one that you can watch whatever mood you are in." This is simply\u000athe\u000acase with this movie. Whenever I am down, up, crying, laughing or whatever\u000aI\u000acan watch this film and feel even better. Tim Robbins plays Andy Dufresne\u000ato\u000aperfection. A film with so many twists where you think "That's it, he's\u000agonna kill himself" but it carries on and you see all the characters\u000adevelop, even Morgan Freeman who plays the emotion-less 'Red'\u000a(brilliantly,\u000aI might add) at the beginning who doesn't give a hoot about anybody other\u000athan getting the other inmates what they want turns out to be a person who\u000aaccepts that there may be hope. A film which is great throughout and has a\u000afabulous ending.\u000a

V\u000a\u000aThe Shawshank Redemption is a great and dramatic movie. It's acting, plot,\u000aand screenplay are extraordinary. The directing is very well done. This\u000amovie is one of the best pictures to come out of the Hollywood for a long\u000atime.It mainly is about a man named Andy who goes to Shawshank for the murder of\u000ahis wife. While he is there is meets this man named Red, who later becomes\u000ahis best friend. Tim Robbins and Morgan Freedman were the perfect actors for\u000atheir parts. They act very realistic.While I read the short story by Stephen King which this movie is based on\u000aand I realized they got most of the stuff that was in the book on to the\u000ascreen. This two hours that are spent very wisely. I suggest this movie to\u000aanyone is ready to watch a great film with a great ending.Rated R\u000aWhat I think it should be rated and why: R for some violence and\u000alanguage.***** out of 5\u000a

V\u000a\u000aI have read many of the post put to this movie and i became extremely\u000aangered by  some of the people who would compare this to wells or akira\u000akurasawa. That would be as brain dead as comparing star wars to star\u000atrek.\u000aThis is a movie of hope and freedom and love. Someone pointed out that it\u000anot an accurate portral of prison life. It may not be, because it is seen\u000athrough the eyes of one man red redding. Red sees things as he wants to\u000asee\u000athem not as they are (except for institutionalized). In the book red is\u000athe\u000anarrartor as in the movie this means that everything is seen and\u000aintrepreted\u000aby red. and for the mullet heads who missed this pfffew. another point i\u000awould like to make is this movies are not made to be artistic or edgy or\u000amake you think. Although this movies does in my opinion does all three\u000avery\u000awell. A movie is made to entertain to make you feel good or bad etc. And\u000athis movie does that from start to finish. The definiton of a great movie\u000ais different to every person. I hated titanic and citizen kane and gone\u000awith\u000awind. ALl long and boring movies but i acknowledge them as great films\u000abecasue it got a large part of the population talking and loving movies.\u000aTo\u000aall of us who loved this movie please let us continue to love it to all\u000aof\u000ayou who did not perhaps forget your over priced education sit back and\u000awatch\u000ait as just a man imagine your life being taken away in a blink of an eye\u000awould you still have hope ????????\u000a\u000a

V\u000a\u000aThe Shawshank Redemption improves with every watch, so much so that u\u000aalmost imagine your place or your role in the prison and try to\u000aunderstand\u000ahow\u000athat lifestyle would affect you. Frank Darabont may all the praise for\u000aadapting\u000athis novella into such a masterpiece fall on your much deserved shoulders\u000abecause your style of filmmaking is unique in these times of unsubtle\u000ablockbusters. The background to this story is probably too well loved for\u000ame\u000ato\u000ago into but Tim Robbins delivers a painful, regretful, intelligent\u000aperformance that\u000au cant see coming from any other star. Morgan Freemans brings so much\u000acomfort and bitterness to his turn as red that as u reach the end of the\u000afilm when\u000ahis smile starts to show and they embrace u know u have just sat through\u000asomething special.

V\u000a\u000aThere are some very special movies out there. There are those which are\u000ahighly thought-provoking and leave you questioning things. There are those\u000awhich are a mindless blast and great fun to boot. And then there are those\u000awhich are simply sublime. They might keep it simple, but they execute in\u000asuch a way that they drag you in deep and have you caring about the\u000acharacters. The Shawshank Redemption is one such film. This is a absolutely\u000aoutstanding story which is as simple as it is eloquent.It's about a man wrongly imprisoned for the murder of his wife and sentenced\u000ato life at Shawshank. There he slowly finds friends and the drama of their\u000alives is the focus of the story. He promises many times that he *will* break\u000aout within 20 years, and no one, of course, believes him. It's this hope\u000awhich drives the whole movie. Men in prison have nothing but hope. Take that\u000aaway and they have nothing. And that's what Andy (The main character) wants\u000ato avoid.The ending to this is simply breathtaking in its simplicity, but incredibly\u000aheartwarming and will have you punching the air in delight.Nominated for 4 oscars, this won none of them. Utter travesty.A magnificent story, and one which will stand the test of\u000atime.\u000a

V\u000a\u000aWhat is the only thing nobody can take from us? Faith can be taken, so as\u000alove, freedom definitely can be taken away; but there is one think that\u000astays with us till the last breath we take and that is Hope. "Remember, Red,\u000ahope is a good thing, maybe the best of things. And no good thing ever\u000adies." "The Shawshank Redemption" is a movie about hope, patience, friendship, and\u000acertainly freedom. It is a story of two men trying to survive while doing\u000atheir time in Shawshank prison. The performance that Tim Robbins and Morgan\u000aFreeman deliver individually and together is acting at its finest.\u000aEspecially Freeman. His best performance ever. Actually I am not going to\u000abother revealing the plot or the acting of this one for, I shouldfve\u000astarted with that, it is a must see gem. It is a 2h 20 min movie but it\u000adoesn't stop for a minute to surprise and please.I'll take the liberty to say that I've seen quite a lot of movies in my life\u000aso far and learned enough from them to be able to assure on the quality of\u000athis masterpiece. Take my word for it. \u000a\u000a

This movie is simply the best out there because it\u000ahas absolutely no disadvantage.Stephen King's Movies will either be the "worst of all time" or the "best\u000aof\u000aall time" as happens with his books. This is the case of this movie. Best\u000aof\u000aall time whatever they say.\u000a

V\u000a\u000aMy personal opinion is that the Shawshank Redemption is the greatest film\u000aever made. However I fully appreciate the fact that this is not everybodys\u000aopinion. My knowledge of the film industry while not conclusive, is\u000aconsiderably extensive, and in my short time on earth I would like to\u000abelieve that I have seen enough movies and learned enough about them to\u000awarrant comment on this particular gem. From the opening sequence to the\u000amemorable finale, this is filmaking at its finest hour. Yes, the overall\u000amessage may be simple, but the study of human nature throughout the film\u000arelays the complexities and frailties of the human race. I dont think\u000athere\u000ais one fault in this film and I have watched it many times now. I have\u000aseen\u000amany film opinion polls at this stage and I cannot remember shawshank\u000abeing\u000aoutside the top five in any of them. So we all cant be wrong. What it all\u000aboils down to is whether or not a film can move you, or leave a profound\u000aeffect on you. Films like Shawshank, Seven, Braveheart, American History X\u000aand Jaws had a hugh effect on me, these films to me are what makes movies\u000amagical. For someone else it might be pulp fiction, the godfather or its a\u000awonderful life. The magic of the movies is the effect that a particular\u000afilm\u000ahas on the particular person. I think the shawshank redemption had a\u000aprofound effect on so many people, because we can identify so well with\u000athe\u000apoint its trying to put across (Hope is a good thing, even when all seems\u000alost) and that true friendship can get us out of the worst of times. Films\u000awill always have their critics, thats the nature of the business, but I\u000awas\u000aalways told they dont make them like they used to, this film is proof that\u000athey still can. P.S. Stephen King is a genius.\u000a

V\u000a\u000aThis is wonderful filmmaking filled with gut-wrenching emotion and drama.\u000aI\u000ado not agree that this is the 2nd greatest movie of all time.  Perhaps it\u000abelongs in the top 50.  This film as well as Director Frank Darabont's\u000afollow-up The Green Mile are based on Stephen King short stories and I\u000ahonestly cannot say that one is better than the other.  Masterful\u000adirection,\u000aacting, and storytelling.  I am very, very particular about the films that\u000aI\u000agive a perfect score.  I go for more thought-provoking plots rather than\u000awell-told melodramas like Titanic.  This is certainly an excellent film\u000awith\u000aits triumph of the human spirit theme and I believe that it is worthy of a\u000a9.  Excellent film experience.  ****1/2 / *****\u000a

What I mean is, nearly ten years after its release, I\u000awas able to watch it without having heard anything about it before,\u000aincluding the "big twist". All I know is that it ranks #2 in the IMDB poll,\u000aand I share the puzzlement expressed in one of the comments (not that the\u000afilm does not deserve ranking high....but THAT high?).Watching it on TV and interrupted by numerous commercials hopefully did not\u000atake too much away. But what can I possibly say that has not been said in\u000athe one thousand one hundred twenty-five comments posted to-date on SR?\u000aWell, in my complete ignorance, I was led by the name of King to believe\u000athat this was a horror. When this misconception was soon dispelled, I\u000acontinued to try to make up my mind as to whether the film falls into any\u000aspecific genre and perhaps sub-genre (as High Noon created a sub-genre in\u000aWesterns). I was also not quite sure whether I was supposed to be made to\u000athink deeply or to be entertained. Then came the big escape, and I was\u000aenormously entertained.If I were to mention just one thing about SR that impressed me most, it\u000awould be the character of Andy Dufresne, played by Tim Robbins: an endurer,\u000abut not a martyr; a hero, but not squeaky clean; a loyal friend, but not a\u000apassionate man. Whatever he is or is not, one image emerges clearly: he is\u000acool!A fantastic film, and hats raised to Tim Robbins.\u000a

V\u000a\u000a   Most viewers do not want to go to overly "artsy" movies because usually\u000athey try too hard to be intellectually stimulating but fail miserably\u000abecause it is a difficult feat to pull off.  Movies like American Beauty and\u000aAmélie are few and far between.  And then there's The Shawshank Redemption:\u000asimple, honest, without pretense.  It appeals to the viewers heart and soul\u000aand not his/her head.  No one cares if the prison conditions are 100 percent\u000abelievable.  It's fiction for a reason!  I never even noticed the clichés\u000auntil I read a detailed post describing them, and frankly, I'm content to\u000aignore them.  The spinner bait that hooked me on this movie was the\u000arelationship between Andy and Red.  Watching this movie for the first time\u000a(and dozens of times since) I found these two characters to be two of the\u000amost likeable characters I could think of. \u000a   The climax of this movie is in my top five of all time (TSR, Memento,\u000aUsual Suspects, Se7en, The Manchurian Candidate).  In general, people like\u000ahappy endings.  I am a big fan of tragedies like The Deer Hunter and\u000aCrouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon, but I cannot watch them continually with the\u000asame emotion.  Watching Shawshank for the Xth time, I experience the same\u000aemotional roller coaster as the first time viewed it.\u000a   People dislike the fact that so many people give this movie a 10/10\u000arating.  I feel quite comfortable giving this movie that rating because it\u000ais my favorite movie.  It is not a perfect movie, but the rating system\u000adoesn't go by technical merit.  People should rate films based on their\u000aopinion as a whole and not solely upon how well the director uses cinematic\u000atechniques.  Personally, I couldn't care less  \u000a

V\u000aThere are movies made for money, and yet there are movies that are made\u000afor the sake of propagating the Art of Cinema. These are movies which\u000aappear like Comets once in a Cinema lifetime, instead of doom and\u000agloom; they uplift our sullen mood. I have never been a fan of Fiction\u000asince there is enough drama in real life.However I am an ardent fan of\u000anarrated Movies, which takes me to Scorsese and his catalog of\u000aCelluloid Classics.There was some great narrative styles in "Good\u000aFellas" and "Casino", but Morgan Freeman takes narration to a newlevel.\u000aHis Barry White tinged voice is one of the glues that hold this tale of\u000aa convict who has more convictions in his soul than the alleged\u000aconvictions. Morgan Freeman is the finest actor in his genre. Tim\u000aRobbins as "Andy" is one of the best performances by an actor, that I\u000ahave seen lately. some of the common threads to a good movie that I\u000ahave noticed is the Scriptwriter who also wields the megaphone, since\u000athis gives a edge over a director who is trying to put a face on the\u000astory. Frank Darabont has done a splendid job so much so we feel that\u000athese two Characters are alive and working on their boat in sunny\u000aMexico. The dual talent of writing and directing is evident in the\u000asuccess of great Directors like Coppola, (God Father, with Mario Puzo)\u000aScorsese.(Good Fellas, with Nicholas Pillegi). God bless these kindred\u000asince they have made some great movies and Shashank Redemtion is one of\u000athem.\u000a

V\u000a\u000a`The Shawshank Redemption' tells the story of wrongly accused\u000amurderer, Andy Dufresne (Tim Robbins) and his story of survival inside a\u000amaximum-security prison.  As Andy enters Shawshank prison, he soon\u000arealizes\u000ahis innocence doesn't matter.  He's in a place where everybody thinks they\u000aare innocent. Andy is portrayed from the view of a second person, and most\u000aof the time we see what this second person sees.  He meets Ellis `Red'\u000aReddings (Morgan Freeman), the man who can get things from the outside.\u000aRed\u000awas able to obtain almost anything the prisoners want, but always for a\u000aprice.  Slowly a friendship grows between Andy and Red.  It's interesting\u000aRed is the only `guilty' man in Shawshank Prison.\u000aThis movie is not about the normal prison violence that is seen in many\u000aprison films.  There is some violence, but nothing too drastic.  The film\u000afocuses more on making the best of a bad situation.  Andy demonstrates if\u000aa\u000aperson's life is based on strong values, he doesn't compromise his values\u000ain\u000aany situation.  Often these values can affect others in a positive way.\u000aAndy never gave up his hope, his hope that someday things will go right.\u000aThe tagline `get busy living, or get busy dying' sums up the message of\u000athe\u000afilm.\u000aIt is a good film.  It has a simple story that is easy to follow.  The\u000aacting is good, and the director Frank Darabont, is able to keep me\u000ainterested through the entire movie.  It also has a surprising and\u000amemorable\u000aending.  I don't know much about prison life and how it really is, but\u000athere\u000aare a few things which seem a little unrealistic:  alcohol for the work\u000acrew, and how Red is able to obtain almost anything the prisoners want.\u000aOverall, it's a good movie. It can give the viewer something to think\u000aabout\u000aand maybe learn from.\u000a\u000a

V\u000a\u000a'The Shawshank Redemption' is based heavily upon Stephen King's short story\u000a'Rita Hayworth and the Shawshank Redemption' - adapted for screen by\u000aWriter/Director Frank Darabont (screenwriter for 'The Fly II' and 'Indiana\u000aJones 4.') Since this film has graced the silver screen, Darabont has also\u000aadapted King's 'The Green Mile' and 'The Majestic' with great success. This\u000ahas truly sparked off a trend of King adaptations such as 'Night Flier,'\u000a'Hearts in Atlantis' and 'Dream Catcher.' In this film an innocent man is\u000awrongly accused of the murder of his wife and her lover, and imprisoned in\u000a'Shawshank Prison' for two life-terms. Within the prison walls (some\u000astronger than others) the enigma unravels as 'Andy Dufresne' (Tim Robbins -\u000a'Arlington Road') meets extraordinary people with the gift of 'seeing hope\u000athrough the bars,' such as 'Red' (Morgan Freeman - 'Dreamcatcher') who tells\u000aAndy to "Get bust living - or get busy dying." Under the harsh conditions in\u000awhich Andy's love for reading, music and friendship are exploited\u000a(sentencing him to the light-devoid 'hole') he uses all his skill and logic\u000ato conduct a plan unlike any other - escape and exploit 'Warden Norton' (Bob\u000aGunton - 'Patch Adams') and start living again.This film is successful due to the simplistic (yet ideal) cinematography,\u000athe splendid acting, the real emotion and the fact that Darabont employs\u000amany of the same cast his other films ('The Green Mile' and 'The Majestic')\u000a- generating a wonderful, intimate atmosphere between the cast. This film\u000aseems like a much-loved, family project - rather than a faceless Hollywood\u000aproduction...\u000a\u000a

V\u000a\u000aThe Shawshank Redemption is the best movie ever made.  I first saw this\u000amovie last summer and really didn't know what to expect, given all the\u000astupid early 90s movies that are out there. But once about 10 minutes in a\u000arealized that this was going to be a great movie, and it was. It, in my\u000aopinion, portrayed what it really would be like to live in jail and, for me,\u000ahow unfair the justice system can be given andy was obviously innocent. They\u000away he escaped was pretty cool too. So, if you have not seen this movie as\u000aof now go out and rent it. It is definitly worth it. ***** outta\u000a*****\u000a

V\u000a\u000aI have never previously written about a movie whether here or on any other\u000asite. In fact, I know a lot about movie technologies that I always felt I\u000awas insulated from being affected by movies as much as a common or a lay\u000aperson.I watched this movie last month on a DVD here in my city. I cried for the\u000afirst time like the way I did. There is something in this film that is\u000abeyond words or description.This movie is to me, the greatest expression there has been in the medium\u000aof\u000acinema. Now I can see how hollow or irrelevant are my or others' expertise\u000ain movie technologies. Technology never evolves, only humans\u000ado.I haven't cared much about other films that make up the top in the IMDB.\u000aAnd\u000amy opinion of this film - that the SHAWSHANK REDEMPTION is the greatest\u000amovie of all time will remain unchanged and is not in any way related to\u000athe\u000areviews or opinions others have for this film. Its possible that the\u000adirector or the Actors themselves may not have much opinion about this\u000afilm.\u000aBut none matters when you are touched. And touched like no other. There is\u000atruth here for me.Till I bought this film, I had not even heard about this film. After I\u000awatched this rarity, I decided to learn more about this film - I have not\u000areally been disappointed with the fact that this film did not receive a\u000asingle Academy Award, but I made a decision there and then, that the\u000aAcademy\u000aAwards will no longer be relevant to me. The Academy Awards cannot be\u000aother\u000athan what it is. I now no longer have even the slightest regard for these\u000alabels and I am glad I have recognised a gem the Academy members would not\u000aor could not.To anybody who cares to read this, I have to say that it is possible or\u000alikely that you will also feel that the SHAWSHANK REDEMPTION is one of or\u000athe greatest movies of all time - only when you disregard your own or\u000aothers' opinions and get down to watch this film. I completely respect\u000asome\u000aopinions that this film does not deserve as much praise as is given to it.\u000aBut does it matter much at all that what could move you like no other does\u000anot affect another ? If the answer to this is yes, you should stop\u000aworrying\u000aabout what anybody has to say about this film and if you would spend any\u000amoney to watch any film at all, just take one chance with this film if you\u000aalready haven't. Its up to you to like it or not - but my thought is you\u000aprobably will decide to like the film or the film would have done\u000asomething\u000ato you. But wait not.\u000a'GET BUSY LIVING. OR GET BUSY DYING"\u000aThe SHAWSHANK REDEMPTION is not one of the Greatest, but the Greatest film\u000aof all time - My words these are, my own opinion this is and not just my\u000awish.\u000a

V\u000a\u000aI don't know why it took me so long to see this film but I finally did. I've\u000aseen a lotta films in my day, but I think this is definitely one of the top\u000a10. Indeed, it's rated by the viewers as the #2 film of all-time on this\u000adatabase, just behind The Godfather. This film is a powerful story of hope\u000aand despair, love and hate, institutionalization and corruption. There's not\u000amuch violence in it, although there is strong (homo)sexual content. This\u000astory takes place almost entirely in a maximum-security prison. The story\u000awould be powerful even with no "brand-name" actors in it, but Morgan Freeman\u000aand Tim Robbins both do a magnificent job in this film. This is a film that\u000ashould not be missed!\u000a

V\u000a\u000aThe IMDb rating of this pedestrian story which relies on the audience\u000amanipulation formula "prisoners good /prisons bad" has proven to me that\u000awe are neck deep into the decline of all things cultural. When they sell\u000amore prints of the Elvis,Bogart, and Marilyn Monroe version of Edward\u000aHopper's "Nighthawks" we know we have a problem. When the people who\u000ahave the Elvis version see the real "Nighthawks" and get confused, we\u000ahave additional problems. When Stephen King's name is bandied about as\u000asomeone's favorite "author" we have Code Red. When Tim Robbins is\u000aregarded as some sort of screen presence that can catapult a movie to a\u000a# 2 spot we have meltdown.There hasn't been a movie with this much depth\u000asince "The Longest Yard." I read a comment earlier by a poster who said\u000athat this movie will drop off the list when the IMDb reviewers grew up.Sadly, their bodies already have, and their minds which will never catch\u000aup.

V\u000a\u000aContains minor spoilers"The Shawshank Redemption" has a lot going for it. The cast and acting are\u000aabsolutely top-class, the main characters (Tim Robbins & Morgan Freeman) are\u000avery likeable and the "bad guys" (warden + guards) are really\u000aevil.In terms of story, I found this movie to be good, but not that special. It\u000ahas some truly touching and emotional scenes, some good jokes and the twist\u000aat the end is surprising and satisfying. Also, you've GOT to admire the\u000apersistence and positive attitude of Tim Robbins' character: NOTHING gets\u000ahim down, no matter what things happen to him, he always keeps believing in\u000ahimself and fighting back in his own way. But overall, there also were some pretty dull scenes and prison movies\u000acliches in this movie..things like the rapists or the old man with the bird,\u000aand the whole new guy/old wise mentor thing have been before. Also, the pace\u000ais a bit slow at times.All in all, this movie certainly was entertaining and refreshing, and it\u000aleft me with a good feeling, but honestly, I didn't find it THAT special. At\u000aleast not special enough to warrant a #2 position in the top 100. Oh well,\u000ait's all a matter of taste I suppose.***1/2 out of **** stars\u000a

V\u000a\u000aI've seen this movie two times now, and must say I quite enjoyed it. But\u000awhen I see all the user comments, consistently expressing how ingenious\u000aand\u000abrilliant this movie is, amazement overwhelms me.The storytelling is rather one-dimensional and straightforward, something\u000alike a story for children. I fail to see any brilliance at all in the\u000aplot.(spoilers)What is the deal with the David vs Goliath story anyway? You can beat\u000aeveryone as long as you have hope and patience? And why is everyone\u000atalking\u000aabout this "get busy living or busy dying"? Come on, people, that's\u000aphilosophy for teenagers, you can do better!What if the warden, for instance, would have ordered to remove the posters\u000aafter one of Dufraisne's wrongdoings? I know I would have! And what if,\u000asomewhere during those 19 years, anyone would have heard him digging? I\u000aknow\u000aI would, with the great acoustics such a prison should have, and how\u000asilent\u000aeverything is at night?Bottom line: this story is far from brilliant and really isn't very deep.\u000aWithin 10 years it will disappear from the top 50 (when all the voters\u000ahave\u000agrown up and lower their score by two or three points).\u000a

And the rest, is\u000ahistory.Nobody, not less myself can explain the appeal of this film. Its long, its\u000adreary and its set in a prison for chrissake? But looking at the list of\u000awannabes who tried unsuccessfully in replicating its magic, from the Green\u000aMile to the Road to Perdition, its not hard to marvel at the mysterious ways\u000ain which Shawshank get us hooked.

I dare say not even Mr Frank Darabont himself can\u000arepeat his own feat. Anyway, Shawshank Redemption has seared into the collective consciousness of\u000aour generation. Let's not psycho-analyse to death its formula and just be\u000aglad there is at least one of them that works, this one.Gilda Rocks!Bye bye.\u000a

V\u000a\u000aThe Shawshank Redemption was one of the deepest movies I've ever seen. There\u000awere no fight scenes, car chases, anything like that, but my attention was\u000athere. I don't know too many movies that can do that.Morgan Freeman and Tim Robbins were awesome in this movie. Tim Robbins'\u000acharacter evolves in this movie. He begins as this innocent (literally) guy\u000awho kept to himself, and then he became more sociable and demanding. As for\u000aFreeman, the movie would not be the same without him. The warden. I really hated that guy. The only antagonist I hated more than\u000athis warden was the bad guy from the Patriot. What I liked most about this movie is that they portray life within a jail\u000acell. They show that the people who are imprisoned are not all bad, and some\u000ashouldn't even be there. We all forget that some of those people are in\u000athere for murder, and we even feel sympathy for them.I would recommend this movie to people who liked the Green Mile. Not only is\u000ait another jail movie, it was written by the same author, and yes, I do\u000abelieve Stephen King is the best modern writer of all. If you have not seen\u000athis movie, you are missing out on the movie that redeemed the film\u000aindustry. Remember, salvation lies within.\u000a

V\u000a\u000aThis film in my opinion is one of the best ever made. When I went to the\u000avideo store one time in 1999, I was in the mood for a drama. It was a\u000atoss-up between Shawshank and some other movie. I chose Shawshank. The\u000aplot\u000aoutline on the back of the movie box was very intriguing. It is most\u000adefinetly the best movie I have ever picked out at a video store. I liked\u000athe movie so much that I went and bought it the next day. Few movies have\u000aas\u000amuch talent and drive as this one. Two of the best actors in my opinion,\u000aMorgan Freeman and Tim Robbins. What an excellent acting duo. It's a shame\u000athat this movie lost Best Picture to 'Forest Gump'. Gump was good, but\u000athis\u000aone was much better. I gave it a 10. What a great movie!\u000a

V\u000a\u000aFirst, I would like to say I did not see this film when it originally came\u000aout in the movies. The trailers and the fact it was a "prison" film never\u000ainterested me. My manager recommended it about three years ago to me when I\u000awas looking for films to rent on a cold snowy weekend. Because it did have\u000aMorgan Freeman in it, I made a  mental note and said to myself, "If its\u000aavailable I may give it a go". All my manager would tell me was it was\u000a"long, drawn out and tedious" but that I should hang with it cause it would\u000abe "well worth the wait". Now he's a decent manager but our lifestyles are\u000aso different outside of work, I was like "yeah right. He would recommend\u000asomething that I would like." But it was available and I rented it. I held\u000aon to it for seven days, about to just take it back since it was due without\u000awatching it but hey--I hated to feel like I wasted money. I watched it and I did not waste my money.This has become to me one of the best films I have ever seen(so far) in my\u000alife. It was long but I got into it slowly, methodically and so\u000acaptivatingly, the time drifted slowly. Sucking me in, I could hardly know\u000awhat to expect. And what I expected didn't happen and I just was transfixed.\u000aTim Robbins to me was brilliant. He painstakingly went through those years,\u000aaging and moving forward through all the disappointments, growth and\u000aexperiences as if he were in a long chess game. I became so caught up I\u000acould not even begin to think about how this would turn out all the stories\u000aand events.And when the end came, I was just blown away by it. I truly loved all\u000aperformances and so many "character actors" now are faces and names I know\u000aand they all performed well and are remembered in my head when I see\u000athem--for this movie. I find myself recommending it now to people and I too ask them to "hang\u000awith it. its well worth the wait".\u000a

V\u000a\u000aAndy Dufrense (Tim Robbins) is found guilty of murdering his wife, and\u000asentenced to Shawshank for life. He's innocent, but unable to clear his\u000aname. So off he goes, to one of the most horrible prisons in the country. At\u000afirst the other inmates don't show him any respect, as they think he's just\u000aa snob. But he manages to get one friend, Red (Morgan Freeman), who he\u000abecome very close to. During his time in prison he finds different ways of\u000aspending his time, such as building a library, helping the guards with their\u000atax reports and putting up posters of pretty girls on his cell\u000awall...Tim Robbins preformance in this movie was the best I've ever seen. I saw\u000athis movie for the first time when I was 13, and at the time I had no clue\u000aof who he was or when this movie was made, but after seeing it I decided to\u000abecome an actress. Later I found out he was Tim Robbins and that the movie\u000aweren't made in the 60's (as I thought...). I guess that was when my\u000aadmiration for Tim Robbins began. Today I have seen alot more of his work\u000aand still believe he's my hero as much as I did that day when I first saw\u000a"The Shawshank Redemption".All the other actors were also really great, and the script is amazing. The\u000ascenes are amazing. Everything about this movie is amazing. You can see it\u000aover and over again, and still be amazed everytime. This is one of those\u000amovies you have to see at least once a year. Just to experience how truly\u000aamazing it is.\u000a\u000a

V\u000a\u000aHaving read Stephen King's short story when it was first published I never\u000awould have predicted it would be made into a movie.  The movie adaptation\u000ais\u000aalso alot more interesting than the original story, mainly because the\u000acharacters are better developed and the story is livlier.  This is one of\u000athe few movies that surpasses the book.  The weakest point of this movie\u000ais\u000athe rather one-sided view of the penal system, even in the dated version\u000aof\u000athis story.\u000a

V\u000a\u000aI find it very interesting that this movie has ranked so high in this\u000adatabase.  One professional reviewer elsewhere had referred to it as an\u000a"overrated cult film," and I can see why.  It is one of those movies that\u000ais\u000aso unique that it just grabs hold of some people while doing very poorly\u000awith the general public at the box office.   But to be ranked as one of\u000athe\u000abest movies of all time?  I honestly don't see why.Personally, I thought the Stephen King story it was based on was much\u000abetter.  True to his style, it was a very surrealistic tale about\u000asomething\u000athat couldn't possibly happen in real life.  SPOILER AHEAD!  Come on, it\u000ais\u000asheer fantasy to think that someone can dig himself out of prison with a\u000arock pick over the course of many years without someone catching on to\u000awhat\u000ahe is doing.  I think that's why the movie is so popular:  it's a\u000afeel-good\u000afantasy that pretends to be a prison drama.But it is very entertaining, and keeps you wondering if Andy really did\u000akill\u000ahis wife.  The ending is too predictable, though.Overall it is a very well-acted and directed movie.  However, the\u000aobjectionable language and the homosexual rape scenes were totally\u000aunnecessary to the plot.  It would have been MUCH better if those aspects\u000aof\u000aStephen King's fertile imagination had been left out of the movie.  If not\u000afor those parts, I would heartily recommend anyone to see it.\u000a\u000a

V\u000a\u000a"The Shawshank Redemption" is a good movie, but there are definitely a\u000anumber of disconcerting aspects to it, such as foul language and violence.\u000aIt takes a lot in a film to actually \u000aoffend me. I'm a reviewer, so I have to tell what I thought about the movie.\u000aVery foul language does tend to bother me a bit, because it gives all the\u000acharacters of this movie a self bad image, in addition to that, the Bible\u000asays `Do not let your mouth coarse foul language because it involves sinful\u000aspeech'. "The Shawshank Redemption" could have been better, but we hear very bad\u000awords and an overdrawn narrative throughout the whole movie. Spoilers: This\u000amovie is mostly about a man who is in jail and has to face evil people\u000aincluding the mayor who wants to make his life miserable, but he's very\u000asmart and gets ahead in life by trying to break a wall with a hammer to\u000aescape from jail! Probably this movie moved many people simply because the\u000amain character (Tim Robbins) was intelligent and brave, however the whole\u000amovie doesn't tell much, only the main character's life in jail and his\u000aeffort to get rid of it by hope and boldness, which I didn't find very\u000aannoying! The ending was somewhat farfetched and predictable, in addition to that we\u000anever knew if the man who killed the main character's wife was punished,\u000ahowever I thought that this movie leaves an interesting message at the end\u000awhich is to have hope when everything seems impossible. 7/10 \u000a

V\u000a\u000aI saw this movie when it first came out 7-8 years ago and loved it. I was 15\u000aat the time. Saw it again recently on TV and I didn't like it nearly as\u000amuch. There's really not much to criticize, it's an excellent work, very\u000awell acted, nicely executed but it's just....idunno.....too plain and safe.\u000aNothing really daring or new about it, and on second viewing many scenes\u000aseem needlessly melodramatic.Still well worth seeing, but nowhere near the classic status that some\u000areviewers here were quick to bestow upon it.\u000a

V\u000a\u000aJust a comment about something that I didn't see anyone else mention\u000arecently. (I didn't read all nine billion comments on this movie) I thought\u000athat the character "Red" was a white man in King's story. Now, there's\u000anothing wrong with casting Morgan Freeman in that part, and he was great in\u000ait. (He was cast as President of the United States in "Deep Impact" and\u000acarried that off very well. I thought it was kind of neat to cast a black\u000aactor as President and make absolutely no reference to his race throughout\u000athe movie. Would that we could be that way in reality.) But TSR was set in a\u000aparticular time, (1947-1968) and I find it hard to believe that there was\u000autterly no racism in a Maine prison in those days. Sort of undercuts the\u000arealism that seemed to be done so well in every other aspect of the movie.\u000aJust a minor quibble. Everything else I have to say about TSR has already\u000abeen said. Grade: A+\u000a

V\u000a\u000aBy Jack the Ripper:Not very many movies can give people that feeling that makes them feel all\u000awarm and fuzzy inside. THE SHAWSHANK REDEMPTION is one such movie. It is\u000ahard to believe that there are people here who did not like this film. I\u000adidn't really like it the first time I saw it, after I saw it a couple more\u000atimes, I realized how good of a movie it was. Every person alive should see\u000athis movie. It tells you how you must never give up hope and should always\u000akeep on trying. If you haven't yet seen this movie, see it today. It is one of the great\u000aAmerican movies ever made. From the interesting beginning, to the extremely\u000asatisfying ending, you are sure to be one of the people taken in by the\u000afuzzy feeling, too. And after you are done seeing this movie, see another\u000agreat one, THE GREEN MILE. If you don't like this movie after you've seen it\u000athe first time, see it again, you're sure to get suckered into liking\u000ait.....5/5.\u000a

V\u000a\u000aI never fail to be captivated by this film when I watch\u000ait.This,indeed,\u000ais no run of the mill prison flick.It is really not a prison movie\u000aat\u000aall.True,it takes place in a prison,but it is really a story\u000aabout\u000awhat lies beyond the prison walls;freedom itself.Some within the\u000aprison\u000awalls crave it,desire it.Others fear it,simply because prison has\u000abecome\u000atheir home,and freedom would remove them from their comfort\u000azone.This\u000ais a sad reality made all too clear,here.This is also a story of\u000ahope\u000aand tenacity.You find yourself looking at the film's main\u000acharacter,\u000aAndy Dufresne (played brilliantly by Tim Robbins),and you find\u000ayourself\u000awanting to have as much smarts,and tenacity as he does.You also\u000afind\u000ayourself looking at Andy's close friend,Ellis "Red" Redding\u000a(played\u000awith flawless perfection,as always,by Morgan Freeman),and wanting\u000ato\u000ago back and correct all the stupid things you did when you were\u000ayoung.\u000aYou look at Brooks (James Whitmore) and you are saddened to realize\u000athat\u000ahaving been imprisoned so long,that he is doomed,never to fit\u000ain,in\u000athis ever rapidly changing world.Being released,in fact,becomes a\u000aworse\u000ahell than being incarcerated in the first place.There are many individual\u000acharacters to look at from different angles,and this is\u000awhat\u000amakes Shawshank a great film.Don't miss it.\u000a

V\u000aBeginning in the late 1940s comes this gripping, poignant, one of a\u000akind prison saga from director Frank Darabont. Freeman is brilliant as\u000aa slick but cynical inmate who's spent most of his life within the\u000acruel prison system of Shawshank; Robbins is riveting as a hotshot\u000abanker-turned-new inmate with whom he forms an unbreakable bond, and\u000acomes to admire for his will, determination, and endless grasp of hope\u000athat allows him to transcend his turbulent surroundings. Their deep,\u000aemotional bond is the focus of this long, arduous, and compelling\u000ajourney that showcases friendship and the power of the human spirit\u000aunlike any other film of its time. A remarkable, in-depth, and\u000aunforgettable story that is sure to be remembered for years to come.\u000a***½\u000a

V\u000a\u000aEvidently I am the only person alive who thought this film was rather\u000alacking. It had its odd moments, but it never really held my attention. I\u000awatch a range of films - action, romance, foreign language, thriller, comedy\u000a- I would say I have very broad tastes. I've sat through many a slow British\u000afilm in my time, and have a fondness for stories about people. This film\u000aleft me cold. I didn't find it especially moving or uplifting. What\u000asurprised me was how tedious I found most of it. \u000aI suspect this is a thoughtful film for people who don't normally watch\u000athoughtful films. I found it thin, lacking in real depth of character and\u000aobservation - so many of the figures where 2d cliches. It lacked pace and\u000arhythm, and it really didn't do enough to consider the fact that most of the\u000ainmates were killers, most especially Morgan freeman's character.I thought that, on the whole, it was a let down. \u000a\u000a

V\u000a\u000aI can't help but feel emotional every time I see this film. Both Robbins and\u000aFreeman are excellent, and the supporting cast is good enough not to screw\u000aanything up, but they aren't spectacular. One of the few complaints I have about the film is that it does get slow at\u000atimes, and I find myself becoming a little bored. Another complaint I have\u000ais I wish the makers of Shawshank would give credit where credit is due for\u000athe amazing amount of scenes and ideas taken from Escape From Alcatraz,\u000astarring Clint Eastwood. How can so many critics claim that Instinct is\u000aderivative while none of them mention the fact that Shawshank Redemption is\u000aone of the most derivative movies of all time? Shawshank is significantly\u000abetter than Alcatraz, and it does have important emotional elements that\u000aAlcatraz is void of; but a theft is a theft, and that won't change unless\u000athe makers of Shawshank start giving credit to Alcatraz. Here are some of\u000athe things stolen: The digging tool being kept in a carved out bible and the somewhat funny\u000airony that that entails. The rapist encountering the star in the showers near the beginning of the\u000afilm to set up further encounters. An inmate at mealtime asking the star whether he will be eating something\u000aand then pulling out a small animal. I'm sure most Shawshank lovers thought\u000athat the whole bird thing was a completely original symbolic idea. Sorry,\u000abut even though the symbolism is well taken, it was FAR from original. The\u000awhole idea probably started with the mealtime animal scene, as it was\u000aobviously a direct steal. The digging debris being emptied out of the star's pants during strolls.The star befriending the black guy who can get you anything. True, Red is a\u000amuch more important character, but this is definitely part of the\u000atheft.There are several others that I have forgotten. And if Instinct had any\u000acliché's, Shawshank certainly did, with the evil warden, the evil guard, the\u000areligion, the "highly intelligent" star, and the concentration on the\u000a"hole", where the star is always sent to burn for a while.Despite all of this, I really do like Shawshank Redemption and will probably\u000awatch it many times in the future, but it absolutely amazes me that I have\u000anot seen or heard one single critic mention the robbery here. And as people\u000abecame critic-following sheep with Instinct, they certainly did with\u000aShawshank. Jeremy Barger\u000a

V\u000a\u000aI enjoyed "The Shawshank Redemption," but it is not a movie in its own\u000aleague, as so many seem to say.  Starting off, it is almost a sure thing\u000athat no prison movie could ever be in that category for me.  The closest\u000awould be "Papillon", which is clearly better than this, and other movies are\u000abetter at capturing general mistreatments of prisoners even as they focus on\u000acertain main characters.  Here, altho there were other instances of abuse,\u000athe emphasis is on the main character in his role in the story, not the\u000asociety of prison inmates.  Not that I am a particular lover of the total\u000adepressing side, but to communicate negative qualities of a prison, the bad\u000astuff needs to be presented more--the violence more graphic, the negative\u000aconditions more thoughtfully.  I know people cite the story as well, but I\u000athink if this movie is to be on such a high pedestal there should be\u000asomething more special about the portrayal of life in prison, and there\u000aisn't.I thought the acting performances of Tim Robbins (who plays chief character\u000aAndrew Dufresne) and Morgan Freeman were, similarly, quite good but not\u000agreat, and although I was into the story, it just did not bring tears to my\u000aeyes.  I don't think the "twists" were all that unique--I guess I've been\u000ajaded by the modern (80s onward) murder dramas.  Nevertheless, the storyline\u000awas good, the warden nice and despicable, and there were interesting ideas\u000are Dufresne's functions in prison.  The ending was also well done, and I\u000aacknowledge, somewhat moving.  Certainly recommended.\u000a

V\u000a\u000aImagine yourself in 1940's Maine, accused of a despicable crime of revenge\u000aon your wife and the man you recently found out was her lover, sent to a\u000acorrupted prison with a two-faced warden, where inmates are murdered for\u000aknowing information that would help an innocent man off the hook, or for\u000acrying on their first night of imprisonment. Where popularity with the\u000aguards gets you special privileges and crossing the warden while just\u000atrying\u000ato get the freedom you deserve gets you thrown into 'the hole' for a\u000amonth.\u000aThe only light of hope is the special friendship with a fellow inmate by\u000athe\u000aname of 'Red' and a rock-hammer hidden inside a Bible. "Salvation lies\u000awithin." You can take my word for it, one thing that does lie within this\u000amovie is an incredible story of hope that will bring you to the point of\u000atears at some points and enrage you at others. The acting is brilliant,\u000athe\u000ascreenplay is superb. This drama places a new sense of hope in you that\u000ayou\u000awould never have felt before. "The Shawshank Redemption" is absolutely the\u000amovie of choice for anyone who appreciates excellency in\u000afilm-making.\u000a\u000a

V\u000a\u000aI won't go into all the good things about the movie, since pretty much all\u000aof the other posts do, I'll just say I agree.  There was only one thing\u000awrong with it.  Are we supposed to believe that in a prison in 1948, a\u000ablack\u000aguy was best buds with a bunch of white guys?  Oh well, this was made when\u000ait wasn't politically correct to have a movie with an all white cast.  If\u000ayou can get past that one flaw, this movie is a 10.  If you can't, the\u000amovie\u000ais still an 8 or 9.If you're depressed, this is an excellent movie to watch.  It focuses on\u000awhen life has really beaten you down.  No matter what happens to him, he\u000atries to get the best of the situation.\u000a

V\u000a\u000aI've never been in the military, I've never been in prison.  I read books\u000aand watch movies.  When I meet people who know the inside of either\u000ainstitution, I ask them, "Is such-and-such a movie accurate?"Whether "Shawshank" is accurate or not, I cannot find out!  My friends who\u000aknow prisons don't watch movies!  But "Shawshank" is cinema storytelling at\u000aits finest.  If you love a good story, and can handle some of the rougher\u000athings in life, this is your movie.The choice of Morgan Freeman for the narrator, Red, was inspired.  But I'm\u000abeginning to wonder if casting Morgan Freeman is ever less than inspired at\u000aany time, for any part.  His warm voice and gentle accent is impossible not\u000ato listen to.  I think that voice could keep your attention reading the\u000adictionary aloud.  His face is always interesting.  If Morgan Freeman is in\u000aa movie, I'm willing to give the movie a chance.This is the second Tim Robbins movie I ever saw.  And this is quite a\u000adeparture from his "Nuke" LaLouche in "Bull Durham".  His performance is\u000aintelligent, understated, intense.  He is a great movie actor--he doesn't\u000aneed to speak to communicate volumes.But the real star of "Shawshank" is Stephen King.  He has become the premier\u000astoryteller of our day.  He puts words together to make magic like no one\u000aI've ever read.  And his stories translate so well to the screen.  "Stand By\u000aMe" proved it.   "Shawshank" confirms it.  All hail, Stephen\u000aKing!If you haven't seen "The Shawshank Redemption", do so.  Maybe, like me,\u000ayou'll be looking to buy the video for your small collection of movies to be\u000aseen over and over again.\u000a

V\u000a\u000aFriendship.  In a word, this movie is all about friendship.  Great casting\u000amakes the characters believable.  Extraordinary acting makes them come to\u000alife.  The bond developed between Andy (Tim Robbins) & Red (Morgan Freeman)\u000ais so real that you feel it.  If you're not a sensitive male going in, you\u000awill be one coming out.  Go BUY this movie.  It'll make you laugh, cry,\u000aand -- most of all -- hope.  The supporting cast is almost as good as Andy &\u000aRed.  The warden is diabolically evil.  And his #1 minion (Clancy Brown)\u000aturns in a first-rate performance.  Much attention was paid to the sets. Not\u000amuch left to say except . . . what a movie!!!  There is no comparable film\u000awork out there.  I "hope" someday there will be.  'Til then, The Shawshank\u000aRedemption is the best-in-show.\u000a

V\u000a\u000aHow can anybody dislike this film. It's definitely the best drama film I've\u000aever seen. If you haven't already seen this film, don't rent it, BUY\u000aIT!!!!!. I don't know of anybody who dislikes this film. Its very similar to\u000athe 'The Green Mile' but only better, I do like the Green Mile though but\u000athis is far better. This film should be number 1 instead of the 'The\u000aGodfather'.\u000a

This film is a\u000amasterpiece and my third favourite film of all time, second only to The\u000aGodfather and Schindlers List. The Shawshank Redemption, 9/10. The second\u000abest film of the 1990's.\u000a

V\u000a\u000aThe Shawshank Redemption is a movie that slid through the Theatres without\u000adrawing much deserved attention. It made no real impact at the academy\u000aaward\u000aeither. So why is this movie currently holding the second spot at the imdb\u000atop 250, only beaten by the untouchable "Il Padrino"?\u000aFirst of all, I believe the movie is spot on when it comes to the\u000adescription of human endurance, persistence, and adaptation. The\u000adevelopment\u000aof the characters also indicates that imprisonment and freedom can't always\u000abe divided by walls alone. Sometimes the highest walls and the worst\u000aconditions aren't enough to stop the human spirit, other times the absence\u000aof boundaries and even the prospect of something better, can break you down\u000aif you lack some of your primal needs. This is where I believe the\u000agreatness\u000aof this movie really shows. It perfectly pinpoints the vast scope of the\u000ahuman mind, and how we react both similar and differently to challenges in\u000alife, and the movie does so in a simple, straightforward way! As "Red" says\u000aupon the climax of this marvellous movie: "Every man has his breaking\u000apoint"\u000a

This is not a blockbuster but a classic to all movie buffs and\u000ait is becoming more and more known and appreciated. I love this film. I have\u000aseen it the for the third time recently and still it brings tears into my\u000aeyes at some points. The cast is great, with Morgan Freeman and a great Tim\u000aRobbins. I still do not know what to think of Andy (Robbins), did he do it\u000aor didn't he. There are several hints in the film but I still do not know,\u000afor Andy is a hard man to see through.WATCH THIS MUST SEE8 out of 10\u000a

V\u000a\u000aSo says the warden of Shawshank prison, though Andy Dufresne (Tim Robbins)\u000afinds it belongs to a lot more people in this often-harrowing\u000atale.The Shawshank Redemption is a very, very clever film in that it takes its\u000acall from elder cinema, meaning it can net not only acclaim but also a wider\u000aaudience. It's surely no coincidence that the first sound we hear  before\u000athe titles have even begun to roll - is that of The Ink Spots singing "If I\u000aDidn't Care". The shot pans out to Tim Robbins in an old-fashioned\u000aautomobile and then to a courtroom where his last words to his wife were\u000a"I'll see you in Hell". No profanity from a bitter man in 90's cinema,\u000athough expletives do flavour the piece, with 24 uses of the f-word and 48\u000aminor swearwords.A few minutes into the film and part of the reason is given: the setting is\u000a1947. However, the oldstyle trappings of the piece never leave it: violence\u000aand sexual activity are never laboured on. Beatings are delivered in shadow,\u000aor, in the case of Andy's first, the camera discretely pulls back and turns\u000aa corner while we just hear the sound. Note we are never shown that Andy is\u000araped, we are just told that he is by Morgan Freeman's narration. That's\u000aanother strong point of the film, and also an historical device, that of\u000afirst person narration. Freeman adds a constant magnetism to the film; his\u000avoice-over a necessity considering it takes place over 20 years.\u000aRefreshingly, the ageing process is used subtly, if at all, rather than\u000ausing unconvincing prosthetics. A little grey to Morgan's hair and the power\u000aof persuasion is all that is needed to carry out the illusion of time\u000apassing.Another interesting point is that of race. Someone once told me they didn't\u000alike the film because they saw the black/white male bonding between Robbins\u000aand Freeman as too contrived and worthy. I told them that this showed a\u000asuspect attitude on their part as Ellis Redding's skin colour hadn't\u000aoccurred to me, nor is it ever mentioned throughout the film. It isn't an\u000aissue that Redding is black, he just IS. Ultimately, the redemption of the title comes from Robbins' humanitarian\u000aintellectualism against the warden's fundamental religious beliefs. But the\u000aultimate testament to erstwhile cinema is that of two things: plot and\u000acharacter. It's this strength of character, not to mention two superb\u000aunderstated leads, which mean you can watch it again and again, even when\u000aone viewing reveals the twist in the tale. All the characters are\u000athree-dimensional, breathing human beings that get not lines, but emotions\u000aand beliefs. Occasionally some  not much, but some  of the dialogue can\u000astrain towards the overly sentimental. Perhaps this is what produced the\u000anauseating tagline "Fear can hold you prisoner  hope can set you free".\u000aYuck! But generally this pleasantly paced, well-told tale hits the target in\u000ait's own relaxed way. Far from pedestrian, the timing of the film is like\u000athat of drinking a cool beer on a hot summer's roof, or a whole yardful of\u000ainmates standing stock still to the beauty of Mozart. The Shawshank Redemption was released the same year as Pulp Fiction, yet\u000aboth of them were disgraced at the Oscars by the forgettable Forrest Gump. A\u000agreat oversight.\u000a

V\u000a\u000aThe Shawshank Redemption is a masterpiece. It is certainly the finest work\u000aof Tim Robbins' career, and Morgan Freeman even surpasses his usual lofty\u000astandard of excellence. This is one of those few movies that one can watch\u000amany times over and never get tired of it. It is hard to believe that the\u000astory is based on a novel by Stephen King. Every aspect of this film is\u000afirst rate. It's the closest to a perfect film I've seen in the decade of\u000athe nineties.\u000a

V\u000a\u000aNow, I am more than willing to admit this film's good points.  Yes, it was\u000awell crafted from everything to costumes to writing to cinematography to\u000ahistorical research.  Yes, it was an inspiring film and one of the few\u000agood\u000ascreen adaptions of Stephen King's works. And yes, it was well acted and\u000ais\u000aone of the few movies released this decade that I could watch with my\u000aparents without being embarrassed.But to be considered one of the greatest movies of all time?  Really?  It\u000awas definitely a good movie, but I just can't see it as one of the All\u000aTime\u000aGreats.  If you want to talk about all those good points, then where is\u000a"Stand by Me"?  I would be much more likely to vote for it, but it still\u000ashouldn't clear the top 10!!While I can't think of anything that was bad about it, I just don't\u000abeleave\u000athat "The Shawshank Redemption" has what it takes to be considered a\u000aclassic.  It didn't really touch on any new ideas or delve deep into any\u000avolatile emotions.  And while it did give you something to think about at\u000athe end of the movie, it is not something stays with me like so many other\u000atruly classic movies do.Despite my misgivings on it's placement in movie history, I would still\u000arecommend it to anyone who asked about it.  But no one has ever asked, and\u000aI\u000anever really think of it.  It was good, it just wasn't all that memorable.\u000a\u000a

V\u000a\u000aWell, Shawshank Redemption is a perfect movie.  There is no scene out of\u000aplace, no piece of music that stands out, the moral is very clear, and it\u000adoesn't even need to be spelt out for you.\u000aThe acting by Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman complete the movie and make\u000ait the heart-warmer, the tear jerker, the nail biter, and the perfect\u000amovie\u000athat it is.\u000aAfter I saw it for the first time, I was instantly touched and a fan for\u000alife.  I've only seen it three or four more times, but each time I see it,\u000aI\u000alearn something new, or discover a new angle of the story.\u000aI'd say that if you only see one movie for the rest of your life, it\u000awould\u000ahave to be Shawshank Redemption.  And if, after watching it, you can tell\u000ame\u000athat it isn't the best movie in the world, then I'd say that there is\u000asomething seriously wrong with you.\u000a

V\u000a\u000aThis was a great movie -- no question about it, but it shouldn't be listed\u000aas #1 on the "Top 250."  I whole-heartedly agree with many of the others\u000awho\u000acommented along these lines.  How could anyone possibly put this film\u000aabove\u000a"Citizen Kane," "Casablanca," "2001," or even "Shindler's List," or "The\u000aGodfather"?  It had all the right qualities: a great story, terrific\u000aacting,\u000agood musical score, etc., but it just doesn't stack up against many other\u000atruly great films.  I guess it just got the most 10's in the voting...\u000aPopularity has its advantages.That aside, I felt as if the story could have been structured a little\u000abetter.  That was the movie's only real flaw. Because we only find out\u000aabout\u000ahow Andy pulled off his "redemption" after the fact -- and it's all told\u000alater, through Red's narration, we never get any of the excitement of\u000arooting for Andy, fearing for him, etc., wondering if he can pull it off.\u000aWe are left as oblivious to it as the warden was.  Had the audience been\u000ain\u000aon it, it would have been a much more satisfying film to watch, and the\u000aending would have been all that more sweeter.  Compare this film to "The\u000aGreat Escape" and you'll know what I mean (another film deserving a higher\u000aranking!)\u000a

And to think that it came\u000afrom "Stephen King" although this is not the first time King has given us\u000asuch a great flick ("Stand By Me", "Misery", "The Shining").  Whats more\u000aunbelievable is that it was snubbed of the Best Picture for both the\u000aOscars\u000aand Golden Globe.  Sure "Forrest Gump" was a great film but it's not often\u000athat you find a movie so captivating and can have such a beautiful, edgy\u000aand\u000arealistic storyline.  Even the AFI's "100 movies 100 years" didn't include\u000athis in their list.  Both critics and audiences have had positive things\u000ato\u000asay about this movie.  I think that if you haven't watched it yet, then\u000ayou\u000atruly can't understand what true movie-making is all about.\u000a\u000a

V\u000a\u000aThis was a good prison movie, although I have never really seen that many,\u000abesides Cool Hand Luke.  I guess I like this movie better than Cool Hand\u000aLuke, because this is made around the time I was in high school.Anyways, I rented this movie last weekend when I went home. I saw it\u000aearlier on TNT, but like always it was edited.  I like the story about a man\u000asentenced to 2 life sentences and the friends he makes in prison, especially\u000aMorgan Freeman who is a wonderful actor!  It starts in the year 1947, until\u000aRobbins busts out of prison.  Coincidentally, Freeman gets out just after\u000aRobbins breaks out.\u000aNot that this really matters, but wouldn't all of these guys look much\u000aolder after twenty years?  I mean I look older than I did when I was in\u000aearly high school, and that was only 5 years ago!  These guys didn't show any\u000aexternal signs of aging from the beginning of the movie until the end, which\u000awas a period of 20 years.\u000aAlso, wouldn't the guard, you know the real S.O.B. Hadley have been\u000aforced to retire?  He looked to be in his 30's when Robbins arrived at\u000aShawshank in 1947, but you think that when the show arrived into the 1950's\u000ahe would have been forced to retire.  But, I enjoyed all of the characters.I don't know if I would say this was the best #1 movie of all time.  You\u000ahave to consider Jaws, Psycho, Star Wars, Raiders Of The Lost Ark, etc.  But\u000athis movie could be considered a classic, but it's hard to say which movie\u000ais more of a classic than another one was.  I would definitely rate this\u000amovie as a classic.  But, if you want a good prison movie to watch, I would recommend this if\u000ait isn't checked out.  If this classic prison movie is checked out, then I\u000awould get Cool Hand Luke.\u000a

V\u000a\u000aNo, this is NOT the greatest film of all time.  I don't think you could\u000apinpoint one single film as that but "The Shawshank Redemption" is one of\u000athe most powerful and moving experiences of the 1990's (other masterpieces\u000ainclude "Schindler's List", "Dead Man Walking", "The Piano", "Glengarry Glen\u000aRoss", etc.) "The Shawshank Redemption" is the harrowing story of a man\u000awrongly convicted of murdering his wife and her lover.  He is sent to prison\u000ato serve two life sentences.  There he meets Red, who becomes his best\u000afriend.  The film speaks loudly about hope and its unending importance in\u000alife and that is a lesson we too often forget.  This film is a marvelous\u000areminder, with remarkable performances by Tim Robbins and Oscar-nominated\u000aMorgan Freeman.  It is beautifully written and expertly directed and a fine\u000afilm in several aspects.Regardless of whether it IS the greatest film of all time, the greatest film\u000aof the decade, or the greatest film of 1994, it is not to be missed for it\u000aholds wisdom and is great fun. \u000a

V\u000a\u000aPerhaps the greatest challenge of the AMPAS is determining what defines a\u000a"Best Picture." I have heard it defined from some forgotten source directly\u000atied to the AMPAS that a Best Picture is one that holds itself superb in the\u000afollowing three categories: Direction, Writing, and Acting, not necessarily\u000ain that order. A good example would be Citizen Kane, arguably the most\u000aworthy winner of these three categories (Kane lost to How Green and never\u000apicked up the Best Picture statue). However, it is certain that the greatest\u000afilm of all time would need to excel especially in one field: Originality.\u000aHow many people would even go bother to see another interpertation of\u000aTitanic? However, if this particular film had come out before the Cameron\u000aversion, it would certainly be hailed with critical acclaim. Shawshank is\u000aone that meets the AMPAS standards of excellence, and most certainly would\u000ahave taken the Best Picture title, if not for Forrest Gump, a film which\u000amany members perhaps found it impossible to not vote for due to the momentum\u000ait had gained. If Shawshank had been nominated almost any other year of this\u000adecade, the statue would have been a lock. However, we must look at\u000aShawshank not as the year's Best Picture, but as a film in the long timeline\u000aof movie history, a film which tells an original story with original acting\u000astyle and original directing. Can we look at Shawshank and with all\u000asincerity call it the greatest film ever? Before deciding, a prerequisite\u000ashould be to see at least 50 of the best films of this century. In this way,\u000aShawshank loses the advantage of being fresh in our memory, losing the\u000aemotional effect, and must bow to the annals of time as do all the other\u000asuperb films of history. Shawshank is not the Best Picture of all time nor\u000athe greatest film of all time. This is a fact we must face and learn to live\u000awith, no matter how much the storyline touched us all.\u000a\u000a

V\u000a\u000aIf anyone has any doubts about how great this movie is...just look at the\u000anumber of votes, the average of them, and read all the user comments.  It\u000awas a crime not to award this movie the Oscar in 1994.  I have used the IMDB\u000afor two years...at least...and Shawshank is consistently in the top three;\u000athe only exceptions being when one of those over-advertised "hype" movies is\u000afresh in the box office.  To anyone who has not witnessed near perfection in\u000amovie-making, just rent this movie and think about how you feel as the\u000acredits start to roll at the end.  I'd go out on a limb to say that anyone\u000awho isn't moved emotionally to a higher level after seeing this movie is\u000aprobably a robot.In my opinion, it's not the number one movie of all time (please see Holy\u000aGrail) but it is a very close second!  And, I believe the AFI should pay\u000aattention and make this movie its first amendment to the top 100 of all\u000atime.\u000a

V\u000a\u000aSuch a gripping story -- innocent people do get locked up, 'ya know -- and\u000ait's so very sad...  I loved the end of the movie.  Very realistic, I'm\u000aafraid -- I pray it makes criminals think twice before thinking that prison\u000ais tolerable - and I wish our criminal justice system would wake up and\u000amake some corrections.  People need rehabilitation, not\u000atorture.\u000a

V\u000a\u000aI remember the first time I saw this movie. It was on the big screen. Let me\u000asay something about how movie-goers in my country watch their movies at the\u000acinemas. They always leave before the credits at the end of the movie is up.\u000aBut it was different with Shawshank Redemption (S.R.) Most of the audience\u000ajust sat on although there were not many because it was a working day. All\u000awho stayed on for the ending credits were obviously moved by the movie. I\u000astayed on to learn who wrote the story. As I left the first thing on my mind\u000awas "I've got to get hold of the novel from which this movie is made. Some\u000ayears later the VCD version is in the market. I have watched it in the\u000acomfort of my home several times and find that I still enjoy it at every\u000aviewing.  I am puzzled how a movie this good could let Forrest Gump sweep\u000aall the price. It makes me doubt the credibility of the Academy of\u000aPerforming Arts.\u000aThis is a story about Friends. When one has a true friend, no matter how bad\u000athe situation is it makes life tolerable.\u000a

V\u000a\u000aI went in to give blood- the staff was watching this.. needless to say\u000aseveral orange juices and cookies later I was still at the blood bank,\u000alaughing and crying with the staff.  This is a remarkable movie for its\u000asubtlety- I like the fact that no one ever knew Andy was digging a tunnel- I\u000alike how he tells his friend to look a certain place if he ever gets out-\u000aand I like the message of hope for those who feel hopeless. Stephen King\u000aoutdid himself with the story and Robbins and Freeman do wa wonderful job\u000awith the script they were given. Just to see the words " brooks was here"\u000aand then "so was Red" add those little touches that makes a movie great. A\u000amovie that deserved more accolades.\u000a

V\u000a\u000a"The Shawshank Redemption," whilst being a particularly well made and well\u000aacted film, still remains a somewhat empty and unoriginal piece of\u000aentertainment. For a movie with a length of nearly two and a half hours,\u000avery little actually happens in the film, apart from significant character\u000adevelopment between both Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman. Other than that,\u000athe story is both basic and conventional - Tim Robbins is wrongly convicted\u000aof murder, is put in prison, develops a relationship with wise ole' convict\u000aMorgan Freeman, helps out the prison staff with their taxes. What we have is good Hollywood\u000aentertainment, and yet another Ok adaptation of a short Stephen King story.\u000aBut that's all. There is certainly nothing marvellous or special about Frank\u000aDarabont's movie, and just why it seems to so deeply affect so many people\u000aremains a mystery to me. There never seems to be much to get your teeth into\u000aduring the picture, and, considering its length, the story is ridiculously\u000asimple and conventional. It's often hard not to keep waiting for some major\u000atwist or turn, but one never really happens.There are some marvellously directed scenes, and some of the dialogue and\u000ascripting is very good. There is also no denying that most of the\u000aperformances in the movie are first class, and, as usual, Morgan Freeman is\u000asuperb.\u000a

V\u000aSPOILER AHEAD, DON'T SAY I DIDN'T WARNED. Andy Dufresne is a banker\u000aconvicted and sentenced to life imprisonment for the murder of his wife\u000aand her lover. The message that the movie tries to pass is that hope\u000acan set you free. It talks about Andy and his friends that lives in\u000ajail for a long time, and how Andy became "successful" even at jail.\u000aAndy knows that his place isn't in there, he dosn't consider himself\u000aguilty for the murder of his wife and her lover, he don't even tries to\u000adefend himself in the court, so when he's in jail he seems to be so\u000apeaceful and tranquilized that the other prisoners thinks he's spoiled,\u000aand he suffers from that from time to time because some queers liked\u000ahim and frequently spanked and raped him. Andy also became friend with\u000athe director of the jail and the guard, using his banker skills to help\u000athem, but in return he asks for his friends to be treated nicely. Andy\u000ahas a lot of hobbies, he's affectionate for stones, and he likes to\u000aplay chess to, but he favorite hobby was dropping rests of what he\u000atoked of his wall inside his cell, he toked 20 years to make the entire\u000atunnel and scape, of course he wouldn't leave his friend Red, behind\u000awith nothing, he told what the future reserved for them and told him\u000awhere to look for it. For me the high level of the movie was at the end\u000awhen they reveal Andy's plan, but it's so complex that I think that you\u000awould rather just go and watch the movie. One of my favorite movies of\u000aall time.\u000a

V\u000aI just saw the movie today. I liked the plot of the movie, and it\u000adidn't feel like it lasted for 2,5 hours. During the film, you start to\u000alove the prisoners, because you get to know them more and more.I think this isn't the GREATEST movie ever, but it sure as hell is a\u000agood movie. I'd rate it a 8 or an 8,5.I like the fact too they show you how the prisoners react when their\u000aprison time is over. I find it hard to imagine how i'd feel if i was\u000alocked for 50 years. And a happy ending always makes me feel allot better.. although it is a\u000abit dull.\u000a

V\u000aI've been thinking why is this movie The best movie for so many people,\u000athen I remembered it is like music, the best music is the ones you\u000aheard at 14. because you associate with memory and when your brain\u000astarts developing and your awareness of yourself and others come into\u000abeing.this movie revitalized my love for classical and baroque music no doubt\u000aand introduced some themes. I find the main character somewhat\u000aunrealistic only because I personally cannot relate to him. If I was in\u000ahis position I doubt I would have done what he did.It is good but I prefer Morgan Freeman's The Bucket List much more and\u000aa variety of prison movies(American History X) and TV series(Prison\u000aBreak).\u000a

V\u000aShawshank Redemption is a fantastic film from the beginning right till\u000athe end. It is really beautiful. The direction and script are really\u000asuperb. The acting of Morgan Freeman is exceptional. If Forrest Gump\u000awas made on another year, he would certainly have got an Oscar. If you want me to describe the movie in one word,I would say, "\u000aBeautiful." The story was very good, the storytelling was better. The\u000ascriptwriter deserves an applause. It is one of the best movies I have ever seen. It certainly deserves a\u000aspot in the top 250. But having said that, I don't think this movie\u000ashould be #1. It will be like a disgrace to the movies like Schindler's\u000alist and Forrest Gump because those movies really touched my heart. I\u000athink Schindler's List and Forrest Gump should come above Shawshank\u000aRedemption.1 thing I forgot to tell you. I liked the dialogue of Morgan Freeman\u000awith the parole evaluator. It was absolutely heart touching. This movie\u000ahas a hidden propaganda. Well, not particularly hidden, anyway. It is\u000aabout the question of imprisoning people. Should it be done??Do we have\u000athe right to do that?? Wouldn't it be better if we try to talk some\u000asense into them?? Or, wouldn't it even be better if we kill them rather\u000athan to give them life sentences?? I think I have an answer but that\u000ashouldn't be discussed because I think this question will continue to\u000abe a moral dilemma of the human communityI really liked that dialogue. Rehabilitated?? Let me tell you something\u000asonny, that word is for politicians so that you can wear a suit and a\u000atie and can have a job. Brilliant. Heart touching.This movie is an emotional dilemma folded together into an easily\u000aunderstandable story. There is one more thing I need to put here. Most\u000ao f the people who have rated this movie # 1 haven't got a clue about\u000athis hidden message. They have rated this because of the surprise\u000aending. This is an open criticism.\u000a

V\u000aThis film has become the film that wins most 'best 100' polls. I don't\u000aknow why but it does.However, this is a good movie. From my perspective I think it is liked\u000aso much is that the plot is ever changing and moves along at a good\u000apace. The story seems to progress in little chapters and it builds to a\u000awonderful climax. As the movie develops we become engrossed in what\u000awill happen next. We do enjoy Andy's victories over the bad guys and we\u000ado want to know what happens in the end.Technically, This is nothing special. There are very few moody shots\u000aand angles that challenge the visual senses. Visually I do think this\u000acompares to Citizen Cane or Pulp Fiction. But in a way I think that\u000abecause we are not distracted by fancy pictures we stay with the plot.Make sure you watch this, even if it is just to see what all the fuss\u000ais about.\u000a

V\u000aWant to know why this movie is the best ever made? Is simple really,\u000abecause it talks about all of us. It tells the story of how we all feel\u000ain times of desperate. The basic needs of all of us, for this movie its\u000afreedom, revenge, and love(friendship)! That is our emotional NEED in\u000atoday world. Therefor I think that if anyone wants to make a another\u000agreat movie they should remember to make the film out of a simple\u000aelement, Human Emotional Needs, and let the lack of those needs drive\u000athe film, until those needs are achieved at the end of the film. That's\u000awhat will make a great film. However it is our creativity that would\u000amake the film comes alive and stick in the viewers mind forever.\u000a

V\u000aA film like this comes along every few decades. Its better than savage\u000aor amazing the only way to describe it is the greatest film EVER. Its\u000aall about a man called Andy Dufresne falsely accused of murder of his\u000awife and her lover and is sent to shawshank prison where he is beaten\u000aby the guards and other prisoners. Eventually he makes a friend called\u000aRed and fits in with Red. Andy was a smart banker before prison and\u000aused his brains to help the other prisoners like solving the guards tax\u000aproblems then the wardens. Andy finds a way to escape from the prison\u000aby digging a hole and using a poster of Rita Hayworth to cover the\u000ahole(That is why the short story is called Rita Hayworth and The\u000aShawshank Redemption) Andy escapes but before escaping he told Red to\u000alook under a tree when he leaves. Red leaves and finds that Andy under\u000aa fake name living in Mexico. The two meet for the first time in years\u000aand shake hands. The Shawshank Redemption starts and ends Fascinating.\u000a

V\u000athe movie shaw-shank redemption is amazing,it compels the audience with\u000ahistory and simple diary narration.it shows you what life is like from\u000adifferent point of views and has a simple storyline "go to prison and\u000adie there" but the people in the movie do not follow on with this line\u000aand are permanently being tested both by mental and physical\u000aassumptions plus every time they attempt to plea for freedom they are\u000aconstantly being rejected and some prisoners (Andy dufrence) are\u000aactually Innocent and in prison every one is innocent but he is really\u000ainnocent to many Innocent's the plot is simple Andy is attempting to\u000abreak out by using the facilities shaw-shank prison has to offer e.g.\u000ahe uses red his best friend to smuggle in necessary items axe posters\u000aand uses other people to help exceed his plans to break out of prison.\u000aall in all i honestly could not find Any faults with the movie and\u000aloved the story,i especially liked the narration and how each scene was\u000arelated in a formal sense.well i really recommend this old classic to be viewed and want to hear\u000aother views\u000a

V\u000aOne of my favourite films ever. I first saw the movie shortly after it\u000acame out, I was around 16 years old. I like to revisit it every year or\u000aso and it's still as fresh as ever. Although there are some unpleasant\u000arealities and strong language, for once I think they are justified and\u000anot overly emphasised.Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman are superb. You would think a film set\u000amostly in a prison would be depressing, boring even. Not so. I always\u000afeel uplifted after watching it and the final scene never fails to\u000abring a tear to my eye. I like it so much I bought two copies on DVD in\u000acase I lose one. This should be on everyone's "must see" list.\u000a

V\u000aThe Shawshank Redemption is one of the finest examples of Stephen\u000aKing's work adapted to the big screen. If not THE finest. Based on a\u000ashort story from King's novella Different Seasons, it may be that rare\u000athing where its a film that actually improves upon its source material.\u000aThe story, of a man wrongfully imprisoned for the murder of his wife\u000aand her lover made for an interesting read, but it made for an even\u000abetter film.Although TSR was nominated for seven Academy Awards, it didn't win a\u000asingle one. Most of them went to the completely overrated Forrest Gump,\u000aincluding Best Picture and Best Actor. I think that was one of the\u000aAcademy's darkest days.Despite the fact TSR did next to no business in 1994, it quickly\u000agathered word of mouth afterwards, and went on to a healthy afterlife\u000aon video and TV. But that's not all. It slowly worked its way into the\u000ahearts and minds of people the world over, and today it's regarded as\u000aone of the greatest films ever made. Even a true American classic. And\u000aits even No 2 on the IMDb top 250. Beating out Forrest Gump by a\u000asignificant margin!TSR is also one of the few films in the world that actually deserves\u000aall the acclaim it receives. I really loved this movie. I loved\u000aeverything about it. The theme of maintaining hope in the face of\u000acrushing despair could have made for Hallmark TV movie material, but in\u000athe hands of first time director Frank Darabont, he's created an utter\u000amasterpiece.Tim Robbins plays Andy Dufresne, the man who allegedly did the crime.\u000aHe is convicted and ordered to serve two consecutive life sentences in\u000aShawshank State Prison. Robbins' performance is interesting if you've\u000aseen the one other really good film he made in 1994, The Hudsucker\u000aProxy. There he played a bumbling, doltish fool. His work in TSR is a\u000ajarring about face.He completely downplays his emotions to the point of resigned dourness.\u000aIts quite a shocking thing to watch. But as good as Robbins'\u000aperformance is, what makes it that all the more special is Andy's\u000acharacter is opened up not by him, but by an external character.Morgan Freeman, in arguably the best performance of his career plays\u000aRed, the prison fixer. He can get things for any inmate. Whether it be\u000acigarettes, or a rock hammer. He is the narrator of the picture, and it\u000ais through his words that the world of Shawshank becomes a harsh and\u000afrightening reality.He knows the ins and outs of the prison system. When new inmates\u000aarrive, he can usually tell which ones won't last. He knows your first\u000anight at Shawshank is the worst. New inmates have to endure the\u000acatcalls and taunts of their cellmates. Red pegged Andy as the one who\u000awould break first. But he never did.Red freely admits he didn't think much of Andy at first. But slowly,\u000athe two men become acquaintances, and much later, friends. Morgan\u000aFreeman's resigned, soothing voice illuminates the harsh surroundings\u000aof the prison walls. The scariest thing about the prison was the\u000aSisters. Sadistic prisoners who turned gay while locked up, and try to\u000aconvert others. First through suggestion. And if that fails, force.\u000aAndy was their favourite target. And he had to endure rapes and\u000abeatings for his first two hellish years at Shawshank.Andy's background as an investment banker brings him to the attention\u000aof Warden Norton. Norton is a hypocritical tyrant. He claims to be a\u000adevout Christian, but he won't tolerate any challenges to his\u000aauthority. Any who do wind up in solitary. For months at a time if\u000anecessary. Norton has Andy secure funds he has embezzled. And in\u000aexchange, Andy can procure funds for a new library and even beers for\u000ahis fellow inmates. As long as he does exactly what Norton tells him\u000ato.The Shawshank Redemption resonates on many different levels as it tells\u000amany different stories. One of the most poignant is the plight of\u000aBrooks, an elderly inmate. Imprisoned for years, when he finally makes\u000aparole, he is terrified. Life at Shawshank has become the only life\u000ahe's ever known. Once released, he knows he'll never survive out there.\u000aAnd he's right. The world has gone and changed on him. And life as a\u000agrocery bagger is no life at all. So he hangs himself. Its a haunting\u000astory. And one that never fails to choke me up inside.That situation extends to Red too. In Shawshank, he has a purpose. He\u000ais respected, valued, needed. Parole is not much different than a death\u000asentence. He gets rejected for parole frequently over the course of 30\u000ayears. And he couldn't be happier.The most wrenching thing of all is Andy's apparent deterioration. He\u000abelieves in hope. And tries to inspire some in his cellmates when he\u000aplays Mozart's The Marriage of Figaro over the PA system. That scene is\u000aa joyful moment to behold, with the men in the yard transfixed by the\u000amusic. And Norton punishes him for his defiance. Andy seems to reach\u000abreaking-point when he confesses to Red he might as well have murdered\u000ahis wife, because he didn't show her enough love and affection.It seems Norton has finally broken Andy. But when Andy escapes, its a\u000atriumphal moment. That famous scene, after Andy crawls 500 yds through\u000aa sewage pipe, standing in a downpour, relishing his first taste of\u000afreedom. It will send your spirits sky-high.Things end appropriately with Andy and later Red gaining freedom, on a\u000asecluded island. I love the way the camera observes their reunion from\u000aa distance. After their souls have been laid to bear, they deserve some\u000aprivacy. One of the defining pictures of our generation. An experience I love to\u000are-visit over and over.Magnificent!\u000a

V\u000aThe Shawshank Redemption is a gripping masterpiece that should not be\u000amissed by anyone. Andy Dufrense keeps us in suspense the entire way\u000awith his mysterious attitude to prison life and his claim that he is\u000ainnocent. Tim Robbins performs excellently. Morgan Freemans role as Red\u000atelling the story was also quite an interesting touch. When I hired\u000athis film my expectations were not that it would become one of my\u000afavorite movies of all time. Guys definitely this is something you have\u000ato see for yourself and you will be categorically satisfied. Many\u000aunexpected twists and turns and actually quite plausible considering\u000athe time it's set in. I found myself on the edge of my seat almost the\u000aentire way. There are many touching and feel good scenes also\u000aparticularly when Andy and his friends share a few beers in the sun on\u000athe roof after dealing his superior and for a few moments feel like\u000afree men. Fantastic film check it out if you haven't seen it re-watch\u000aif you have. 5 stars.\u000a

V\u000aI just wanted to post a few words in order to show my support for this\u000amovie. In my opinion, it is THE best movie I have ever seen in my life;\u000aand I have seen thousands, (literally). I won't say anything more about\u000ahow good this movie is, due to the fact that it has all been said in\u000aother posts, but I would like to say something to the people who don't\u000alike it, and who may even go so far as to rate it with a 1 out of 10;\u000ayou are all retarded.I first asked myself; how could 7,000 people have possibly gave it a\u000aone? Well, how did George W. Bush, the complete moron, get elected to\u000abe the president of the United States of America? Sure, there were some\u000aother reasons, but it's mostly because people are completely retarded.\u000aSo I guess that answers my question. As a matter of fact, I'm surprised\u000athere aren't MORE retards giving this classic film masterpiece a bad\u000arating.Also, the people who made bad comments about it seem to keep talking\u000aabout how it's all hype and how the ignorant masses who love the movie\u000aare all wrong. Whatever fools. I first watched it around ten years ago,\u000aall by myself, when I had never even heard of it in my life. I stayed\u000aup all night watching it on TBS Superstation, (the only station I know\u000aof which somehow managed to have more commercials than actual movie),\u000aand I loved it instantly. There was no hype there, just me and an\u000aawesome movie.I mean, I don't EVER go around telling people about movies cause\u000afrankly, I don't care what anyone watches, but I have not stopped\u000arecommending this one to anyone and everyone since the night I watched\u000ait ten years ago. I also NEVER post my opinions about movies online,\u000abecause once again, I couldn't care less what people watch, but there's\u000ajust something about this one, and only this one, that makes me want to\u000atell everyone to watch it. So there you have it, I ain't no fake critic\u000atrying to pretend I know about all the different aspects which make for\u000aa good movie, by any means, but I'm tellin ya......just watch it and if\u000ayou don't like it at least somewhat, then you should attend some form\u000aof IQ testing facility immediately because you are probably half a\u000aretard lol. PEACE.\u000a

V\u000aFrank Darabont has created a good film about the misuse of criminal\u000ajustice system and the obnoxious corruption in prisons.He has done this\u000aby showing an insider's view of a penitentiary from the perspective of\u000aits inmates.Although Tim Robbins has a good role in this film as\u000aAndy,he is surpassed by Red played by Morgan Freeman.He is at the\u000asummit of his acting prowess as everything is written on his face.There\u000ais no other actor in Hollywood or elsewhere who could have done this\u000arole of Red with absolute conviction as Morgan Freeman. Shawshank\u000aRedeption tells us in clear terms that in prisons it is the rule of\u000aeveryman for himself but sometimes there are exceptions. Feelings of\u000asuffering,sadness,trust,joy,companionship occur which give the\u000aprisoners the hope to carry on.It is nice that there is not much focus\u000aon feminine characters as they did not have anything that could have\u000ajustified their presence.\u000a

V\u000aA beautifully made, bittersweet film. Whether you view it as an\u000aexistential rescue opera (like Papillion) or just a flick (like Escape\u000afrom Alcatraz) it's still satisfying.Tim Robbins' unjustly incarcerated accountant is a measured\u000aperformance, always both hang-dog but alert. Morgan Freeman's\u000aperformance offsets this masterfully; liberated by resignation, he's a\u000awary but more dramatic character. And of course, his voice-over is\u000aalmost like a soundtrack.The supporting cast do a steady job but the laurels have to go to Frank\u000aDarabont in bringing Stephen King's story to the screen. The tale is\u000athoroughly told - the twists are well-concealed and highly dramatic. I\u000aespecially like the detail, right down to the selection of sull'aria\u000afrom Mozart's Marriage of Figaro - the duet is a warm-hearted hatching\u000aof a plot that will lead to that opera's resolution in redemption and\u000areconciliation, just like the film. 9/10\u000a

V\u000aShawshank Redemption is entertaining and well made. It's not, however,\u000athe greatest movie of all time. It's a thoughtful film and is\u000aremarkable for appealing to people who don't usually put a whole lot of\u000athinking into their cinema. It covers the greatest range of viewers for\u000alike-ability from the Fast and the Furious crowd to the Lost in\u000aTranslation audience. I don't think it'd attract big numbers from the\u000acinema nerds of Eraserhead fandom though. That's not to say that Lynch\u000afans should have a more weighted vote on IMDb. It's just that if you're\u000ainto your cinema and you watch a lot of good films, from obscure to\u000apopular, then being told Shawshank Redemption is the best film of all\u000atime is like hearing someone say Radiohead is the best band ever. Yes,\u000athey're very good but you suspect their cheerleaders are only comparing\u000athem to Coldplay, U2 and REM.\u000a

V\u000aIf you analyze the breakdown of votes for each of the films 'The\u000aShawshank Redemption' and 'The Godfather' it is evident that Shawshank\u000ascores higher than Godfather in almost every incidence.... except for\u000athe votes supplied by IMDb staff, whereupon there is a reversal.Hmmmm.Furthermore, and miraculously if you ask me, Godfather is 'voted' #1\u000afilm of all time.By whom one wonders?I think there should be a campaign to get The Shawshank Redemption\u000arightly to the #1 spot. However, IMDb now sift thru the raw vote data\u000aand disregard the votes they don't want. They really are keen to keep\u000aThe Godfather at the top.I think it's pretty unfair myself. They have a load of schpeel about\u000a'vote rigging' which they seem to ignore themselves.Anyone got a plan? I have a Phd in Mathematics, it's a start.\u000a

V\u000aWait, no it isn't. I have a hard time understanding why this movie is\u000arated at #2 on IMDb. The acting is good, I'll give you that, but it's\u000ainexplicable how a standard prison drama that hauls every cliché out of\u000athe book has enchanted so many people. I mean really, does it say\u000aanything new? Have any of its images or dialog made their way into pop\u000aculture (the sure sign of an influential film)? No and no. When you\u000areally look at it, this is actually a pretty boring movie, and the\u000asleep-inducing musical score doesn't help.The most objectionable thing about this movie is how the convicts are\u000amade to be funny, humorous, engaging. I assure you that if you ever\u000astepped foot into a prison, they won't be anything like the characters\u000ayou see in the movie. They are in prison for a reason, usually because\u000athey are uncontrollably violent, anti-social, and manipulative. They\u000aare killers and rapists, thieves, inhuman monsters; putting a friendly\u000aface on them does a disservice to the people who worked so hard to get\u000athem in there. The sheeple who love this movie are the same kind of\u000apeople who were hoodwinked into believing that Robert Stroud (the\u000aBirdman of Alcatraz) was a quiet, gentle, kindly man because of the\u000amovie they made about him. In actuality, Stroud was just the opposite:\u000ahe was a bitter, violent, poisonous little man who wrote detailed child\u000aporn. It doesn't help that Andy's innocence is never shown, it's only\u000aimplied. Why should I root for a man who might have killed his wife, if\u000athey won't show that he didn't do it? The only thing Andy has going for\u000ahim is a convict in another prison who confessed to the crime. It's not\u000aenough for me to believe in his innocence.I guess Morgan Freeman's soothing, grandfatherly narration, Andy's\u000acavorting on a Mexican beach, and the warden's desperate final\u000adenouement might all have something to do with the popularity of this\u000astandard prison movie, but like I said it's all been done before, and\u000ato better effect, in other movies. As an example, James Cagney's howl\u000aof despair when he learns his mother dies in "White Heat" is an\u000aelectrifying moment, and is loaded with more humanity than the icy and\u000adistant Shawshank Redemption.\u000a

V\u000aI don't disagree with the vast majority of folks that have seen this\u000amovie and found it to be excellent. But instead of chiming in with more\u000arave comments, I'll mention the one thing I thought could have made it\u000aa better film.I think the director had a choice as to how to portray the two chief\u000avillains, the warden and the head prison guard. He could have modeled\u000athem after well known American villainous types, or he could have used\u000aa Nazi type model. He seemed to have chosen the later which I felt was\u000aunfortunate. Maybe some would disagree, but I perceived them both as\u000aNazis as I watched the film. The Warden's steely intellectual manner\u000areminded me more of a sadistic Nazi doctor than a bible thumping\u000aChristian. And the prison guard was very teutonic looking and handsome\u000arather than looking like the brutish American stereotype that I would\u000ahave preferred. I guess its a minor point, but given the rave reviews\u000athis movie has gotten, I felt it deserved mention. I would have been\u000aable to identify with the banker's suffering even more with more\u000abelievable, American villains rather than ones that seemed calculated\u000ato evoke memories of WWII prisoner of war camps.\u000a

V\u000aI think this movie was very realistic and I realized that live in\u000aprison is pretty far from reality. Prison is not a joke, prison will\u000achange you against your will. Andy Durfsteen is wonderful character. He\u000ais full of surprises till the end. He has the power to change the hell\u000ainto heaven. He shows us that power is not stored only in muscles but\u000ain brain too. He believes in hope. He knows that he is supposed to be\u000ain prison to the end of his life but there is still hope. He has plenty\u000aof time for escape and with hope he can get over everything. With\u000aenough time and plenty of hope you can escape through 10 meters fat\u000awall with a spoon. Thats all whats this movie about but its not enough\u000ato know, you have to understand, you have to see it. Please excuse my\u000aEnglish but I had to write something.\u000a

V\u000aSo how inaccurate and meaningless are the Academy Awards?The Shawshank Redemption - ZERO awards. Dr. Strangelove... - ZERO\u000aawards. Citizen Kane - 1 award (screenplay). Shichinin no samurai -\u000aZERO awards. Rear Window - ZERO awards. Vertigo - ZERO awardsAnd yet a movie like Titanic can garner 11. I can think of 10 movies\u000athat might be deserving of such a number of Oscars since Ben Hur\u000a(righty) won that many. Titanic ain't one of them. In fact (at the time\u000aof this writing) Titanic is rated 6.9 - a number that, I would guess,\u000amay not put Titanic in the top 1000 movies.Oh, I forgot... IMDb voters are likely not as "knowledgable" as the\u000aelite cattle who vote for Oscars.Ridiculous.\u000a

V\u000aThe Shawshank Redempion is a great movie! It is a story of Andy\u000aDufresne (Tim Robbins) unfairly accused of murdering his wife and her\u000alover. He is put into one of the worst prisons in the U.S., the\u000aShawshank prison. At the beginning in the prison his only friend is Red\u000a(Morgan Freeman). Other people judge him as a coward with no guts,\u000amainly because he never fights, takes part in sport and always has a\u000asad face. Late the people start liking him because the discover that he\u000aa nice creative man. After the old librarian left he became the library\u000adirector. In a few years he created consisting of thousands of new and\u000aold book, and he made a special reading room for people wanting to\u000aread. By doing that he improved the behavior of some prisoners and\u000achanged the whole prison. One day Andy is gone, and no one knows where\u000ahe is!\u000a

V\u000aThis is a movie to give to the people that are in need of hope. I\u000aremember when it was in the theaters and I was one of the few people\u000athat went to see it. I returned to see the film three more times, each\u000atime bring a friends that I had preached the film to. They to were\u000ainspired to rave about the film to friends.My disappointment of the year was to see the film nominated for 7\u000aAcademy awards and not get any. I felt like Quentin Tarantino at the\u000aMTV movie awards. He said something along the lines of, "You don't know\u000awhat it is like to lose to that retard every time." A little harsh, but\u000ato the point.The greatest justice is that "Forrest Gump" is fading while "The\u000aShawshank Redemption" has gained a life of it's own.\u000a

V\u000aAs someone who loves his films and has seen many of them. This film is\u000aone of the tops. I thought upon receiving this film it would be some\u000aboring, over strewn prison film. My god crucify me for i have\u000ablasphemed.The cast are perfect, everyone captured their role perfectly.\u000aEspecially Morgan Freeman and Tim Robbins. Even the minor roles were\u000aprofessionally done.The story was phenomenal. The way it twists and turns and throws you\u000aaround with it is something I didn't expect. If something minor\u000ahappened at one point in the story. You sure as hell better expect it\u000ato be brought up later in the film in a way that makes your jaw drop.This was one of the few films were towards the end, I kept closing my\u000aeyes where i thought it would cut to credits. I swear this film could\u000ahave gone on for another two hours with no affect to the audience\u000abecause of its depth. It absorbs you like a sponge.Unless you're blind watch this film. And if you are blind, I'm sorry to\u000ahear that.\u000a

V\u000aFrank Darabont's beautiful adaptation of Stephen King's RITA HAYWORTH\u000aAND SHAWSHANK REDEMPTION is an experience to remember for life. Tim\u000aRobbins is Andy Dufresne and is sent to prison in New England for\u000amurdering his wife and her lover. Morgan Freeman is Red, the man in\u000aprison who can get things for you. Together, they forge a lasting\u000afriendship as Andy's hope helps penetrate the thick walls in Shawshank\u000aprison, in more ways than one.Andy's first few years at Shawshank are filled with beatings and\u000amolestation's by a group of cretins called the "Sisters." The leader is\u000aa man named Bogs who gives slime balls a good name. Sometimes Andy\u000afights them off but as Red points out, "Prison is no fairy tale world."\u000aRed arranges for his friends and Andy to tar the roof of the plate\u000afactory giving them all a nice rest from the prison walls. Red is\u000adefinitely a man with connections. Clancy Brown is the picture of\u000acruelty as the head of the guards named Byron Hadley. Andy overhears\u000aHadley complaining about how the government is gonna take a nice chunk\u000afrom his brother's inheritance. Andy informs Hadley how he could keep\u000amost of his brother's inheritance by allowing a tax free gift to his\u000awife. Hadley nearly throws him off the roof but manages to hear him\u000aout. Andy sets up the papers for him in exchange for getting Red and\u000ahis friends three beers a piece. To everyone's surprise Hadley agrees.\u000aThis wins Andy a lot of friends especially when one offers him a beer\u000aand he tells him he's quit drinking.The warden gets wind of Andy's accounting skills and realizes he can\u000ause him to do his taxes. Andy gets a vicious beating from Bogs and the\u000a"Sisters" but this time Hadley beats Bogs to a pulp, crippling him and\u000ahaving him drinking through a straw for the rest of his life. Bogs is\u000atransferred out and the "Sisters" never touch Andy again.When Andy returns he finds the poster of Rita Hayworth he asked Red\u000afor. It comes with a note that says "Free of Charge." Red and his\u000afriends are happy Andy is back and well. The Warden, played chillingly\u000aby Bob Gunton as greed personified, transfers Andy into the library and\u000aout of the laundry where Andy worked and endured beatings the first\u000acouple of years.Andy soon becomes an assistant to Brooks, an old prisoner nicely played\u000aby James Whitmore. Brooks cares for a bird named Jake and is well liked\u000aby Red and his friends. Later, Brooks is released and finds he's\u000ainstitutionalized and can't make it in the real world. Sadly, he kills\u000ahimself and this worries Red more than anyone because he's constantly\u000arejected by the Parole Board and fears being institutionalized.Andy sends out many letters requiring more funding for the library,\u000awith the permission of the warden, and gets it converted into a\u000abeautiful place in memory of Brooks. There, Andy helps many prisoners\u000aget their Higschool education's.Andy helps one man in particular out, a young thief named Tommy, that\u000aRed and his friends like as well. Later, Red and Andy find out that man\u000aspent time in prison with the real man who killed Andy's wife and her\u000alover. Andy tells the warden and the warden has Hadley shoot Tommy to\u000adeath.Andy is now trapped helping the corrupt Warden with all his dirty\u000amoney. He confides in Red and tells him he wants to spend the rest of\u000ahis life on an island in the pacific. Red tells him not to think like\u000athat but Andy gives Red instructions to find something of his when he\u000agets out. Red promises too but is worried about Andy. Andy says his\u000achoice is ,"Get busy living or get busy dying." The rest you can find\u000aout for yourself in this thought provoking and perfectly acted film.\u000aThis is not just some prison movie but a movie about the harsh\u000arealities of confinement, the choices we make in our life, and of\u000ahaving hope despite the worst circumstances.Morgan Freeman and Tim Robbins have never been better as well as the\u000asupporting cast. William Sadler does a nice job as Heywood, the Hank\u000aWilliams loving friend who thinks a book in the library is called THE\u000aCOUNT OF MONTE CRISCO.Frank Darabont directs this film so well you truly hate for it to end.\u000aRoger Deakins Cinematography is epic and inspiring and Thomas Newman's\u000ascore finds just the right mood. This film is one of those you turn on\u000ain the middle of and just watch to the end, an incredibly deep and\u000amoving experience.\u000a

A lot of his films are good Of\u000acourse there other good actors Also there are some funny places to\u000awatch..., but this film was brutal. People who haven't seen this film,\u000ai recommend them to watch it... The film beginning was the best in the\u000afilm i think, but I liked the end too. Some horrible things happened\u000athere too, like when that "Elvis" man killed... and of course when old\u000aman (Brooks) died. I would like to watch this film again for many\u000atimes.\u000a

V\u000aSimply stated, this may be the best movie of all time. The story is\u000ainfinitely engaging, the acting is impeccable, the cinematography is\u000amarvelous, and the score is wonderful. It is probably the most well\u000arounded film you can hope to watch. I saw it first in 1995 on video and was amazed that it did not win a\u000asingle Academy award. It certainly should have. Do yourself a favor. If\u000ayou really want to see a true work of cinematic art, see this movie. FOR THE NAY SAYERS: They say that if you are young and NOT liberal you\u000adon't have a heart, and that if you are old and NOT conservative, you\u000adon't have a brain. Well, no matter what age you are, if you do NOT\u000aenjoy this movie you don't have a heart or a brain!\u000a

It was a wonderful story with one of the best endings I've\u000aever experienced in a film. Morgan Freeman fully deserved his Oscar\u000anomination but, conversely, Tim Robbins was robbed of his. His\u000aportrayal of Andy DuFresne, a convict lifer wrongfully convicted of\u000akilling his wife, was nothing short of amazing. How the academy could\u000ahave overlooked him in their voting is beyond me and everyone else I\u000aknow that has seen the film. This is the only film for which I have\u000anever heard a bad comment and it got rave reviews from everyone I told\u000ato see it.

I just wish it will stay there. It was very awful seeing this movie ranked behind just one of LOR\u000afilms. What is even worse is that the only movie that collected more\u000avotes than Shawshank Redemption is LOR1. I hope that will not be the\u000acase one day. If it is the Godfather, we would 've lived with it, but\u000asome times it is difficult to understand these IMDb users' votes.I wont add any other comments to what people already mentioned.

V\u000aWhat can I say about Shawshank that hasn't already been said? This is\u000aone of my all-time favourite movies, and I've seen it maybe a dozen\u000atimes but I keep going back for more.Tim Robbins is cast perfectly as Andy Dufresne, a man convicted of\u000akilling his wife and her lover and sentenced to prison, but who somehow\u000anever quite lets prison break his spirit.In a sense, this can be compared to Cuckoo's Nest; Andy's effect on the\u000aprison and his fellow prisoners is much like MacMurphy's effect on the\u000amental patients. And Warden Norton has a Nurse Ratched-like character,\u000afull of self-righteousness and a kind of indignation at having to\u000a"teach them a lesson".Simple story or not, this movie is uplifting and inspiring. Wonderfully\u000aacted and directed, Shawshank's status as a classic is well-deserved.\u000a

V\u000aI can't seem to be able to find my copy of Different Seasons. Can\u000aanyone tell me the correct spelling of the town they end up in? Maybe\u000ayou could e-mail me at vjohnson18@cinci.rr.com with Stephen King in the\u000asubject line. Thanks Victor. Also,how can anyone say this was a bad\u000amovie? You don't get nominated for Academy awards on the strength of\u000abad acting. The movie is set of course in the forties to start.In that\u000atime period most everyone's mannerisms with each other are very formal\u000aand polite. I believe the movie hit that right on the spot. That's why\u000aI don't understand how someone thinks there is so much overacting. If\u000ayou want to see overacting watch just about everything that David\u000aCaruso has ever been in most notably Csi Miami.He's the only negative\u000athing in that trilogy. Overacting in Shawshank,I can't imagine where\u000athis guy's head was at or what he was expecting to get from this movie.\u000aHe probably thinks the Count of Monte Cristo was a flop too, where like\u000aShawshank the best parts of the movie were the deep conversations, and\u000ainteractions to each other based on the complete range of human\u000aemotions. The intense circumstances of the various subplots of both\u000amovies can't help but bring about the most powerful depiction of\u000aemotions that the human heart can muster. When a movie shows this and\u000acan also make you feel what the characters feel that's a good movie.\u000aWhen a movie covers all the emotions,character buildups and a plot that\u000akeeps you riveted in your seat and You wouldn't know it if the theater\u000awas on fire, that's not just a good movie it's great. Sorry but if you\u000acan't get that maybe you ought to stay with something easier like\u000acartoons.\u000a

This movie has two baffo performances by Morgan Freeman as Red\u000a"the man who can get things" Tim Robbins plays Andy Dufrense the quiet\u000abanker who escapes the soul crushing hell on earth that is Shawshank\u000aprison my first thoughts when i saw this was "this is based on a\u000aStephen King book?? huh this is really deep and emotional" so needless\u000ato say it comes of as something you wouldn't expect IL King to write\u000abut the movie is a great touching look at the indomitable human spirit\u000aand friendship it is a very good movie.\u000a

V\u000aThis shouldn't be #3. In fact, it should be #1. I believe the writing\u000abehind a film is the most important aspect of it. This movie tells a\u000astory of a man who was left to die for something he never did, and how\u000ahe takes what is given to him, and creates a intellectual paradise for\u000ahimself and fellow inmates. Being such a genius, he is able to cover\u000aall his bases knowing that all of it could come crashing down, and it\u000adid. He makes a thought impossible escape, exposes his biggest enemy\u000afor what he is, and takes all his money which rightfully belongs to him\u000aanyway. It is a genius script and both actors are in my top 10. I love\u000athis movie, and it's second to none as it takes the most important\u000aaspects of film-making and owns all other movies at them. (Although\u000aprops to Charlie Kaufman for being the coolest writer ever, but still\u000anot making my #1 movie)\u000a

V\u000aThe best I've seen so far in my life. I have missed it when it came out\u000aand actually I only saw it last week. It was a rerun on TV way after\u000amidnight. I went to bed a 4 o'clock in the morning and next day bought\u000athe DVD. It absolutely great and 9.0 it's way too small a mark for this\u000aone :) The main idea is about an extremely smart guy who knows how to\u000akeep its mouth shut :) ... but I guess there were others that commented\u000athe plot earlier so I can't bring new stuff to it :) If you missed this\u000amovie then go and rent it, buy it do whatever's necessary to see it\u000abecause it's 100% worth. The plot is great, the characters are\u000aexquisitely built and you won't be able to guess what happens. Tim\u000aRobins makes the role of his life in my opinion, and Morgan Freeman is\u000aalso great.Just to compare I have recently saw "Escape From Alcatraz", which by\u000athe way was aired in prime time &#61516;, and it's not even close to\u000athis one.Final advice: YOU MUST SEE IT.\u000a

V\u000a'The Shawshank Redemption' may be hard to convince somebody to watch,\u000abut it's important to make sure everyone does. A prison movie is not\u000athe way it should be classified because 'The Shawshank Redemption' is a\u000astory about people. It is told through a prison and the idea that would\u000abe a cliché in any other film, hope. So, hope no longer becomes a\u000acliché because it is realistic in Shawshank. Thus, people and their\u000amotives and environments make films interesting, realistic,\u000ainfluential, and memorable. And because Frank Darabont found a way to\u000aget all of these elements into the greatest film ever made, people who\u000asee 'The Shawshank Redemption' look at life at a whole new perspective.\u000aThat being to "Get busy living, or get busy dying", and to always have\u000ahope.\u000a

V\u000aWith enough hype and investment, a weak film can top the charts and\u000abreak the records. But, ask real people how they feel about this film and you will find a\u000agenuine majority of awe - from a population that found the film by\u000abeing told to watch it by the most trusted of authorities - our mates.This film is hope and love, carried in a vehicle of misery, struggle\u000aand achievement.It is relentlessly thought provoking.The soundtrack is as powerful as subtle, and like the film, can summon\u000atears without warning.The best in this one cannot be read about.

V\u000aI don't care what anybody says about this movie, it is simply great. I\u000awatched it for the first time, on a bootleg screener copy, back in\u000aearly 1995. I used to get the Academy screeners, and I'd be so excited\u000athat I was getting movies that were still in theaters, that I'd watch\u000asome I normally wouldn't. Shawshank was one of those. Not the type of\u000amovie I would rush to see, but my family had watched it, so I gave it a\u000ashot. I fell in love with this movie after the very first viewing. It's\u000aone of those rare movies that seems to get better, each and every time\u000ayou watch it. When I see it on TV, which is quite often, I find that\u000ait's hard to turn the channel. It's such a human movie. Just about\u000aeveryone can relate to something in this film. If you can't appreciate\u000aa film like this, I truly feel sorry for you. This is what film-making\u000ais all about.\u000a

V\u000aFirst off, let me say that this was the real best picture of 1994.\u000aForrest Gump was definitely a great film, Pulp Fiction was a film that\u000aset new standards in film genre, Quiz Show was great although a bit\u000aoverrated, and I can't say much about Four Weddings And A Funeral.\u000aDespite the greatness of Pulp and Gump, neither of them matched up to\u000athe greatness of this film.This film starts off with Tim Robbins going to prison over a crime he\u000adidn't even commit. The rest of the story unfolds as he befriends\u000aMorgan Freeman's character. The story is based upon the events during\u000ahis stay in Shawshank.When I said that this has everything you could ask for in a movie, I\u000ameant it. This movie has an engrossing story line, some great character\u000adevelopment, awesome acting(you can never go wrong with Freeman),\u000aexcellent score and editing, and an ending that will make you glad you\u000awatched the movie. The movie's place in IMDb's top 250 is well\u000adeserved, but the film not earning it's best picture Oscar is beyond\u000ame.\u000a

V\u000aEveryone who has watched " Shawshank redemption" knows that Andy was\u000aundeserved to be in prison. If it were you what would you do? Snarl?\u000aComplain the unfair society? I will probably get suicide for the\u000ainnocence. For I am not strong enough and there is not so much power to\u000asupport me to go on my life with such heavy burden. After sentenced to\u000aprison Andy was silent. However there was an underset hidden in Andy's\u000aheart while he looked quiet. ¡°Get busy living, or get busy dying¡±\u000areminds me a saying by famous Chinese writer Luxun. That is ¡°break out\u000ain silence or perdition in silence.There is another set of dialogue that is impressive. Red: ¡°Hope is a\u000adangerous thing¡± but Andy said: ¡°Hope is a good thing.¡± His escaping\u000ais the strongest evidence. Andy got a hope for which he can be busy. No\u000aother than this conviction set him free once more. Andy is a bird with\u000abeautiful feather and it is sin to forbid him in prison. Escaping is\u000apredetermined. Miracle is coming true by Andy's Rock-hammer.In the film, dialogue between Andy and Red and Red's monologue\u000adescribed vivid interpersonal activity. And this peaceful talking may\u000astimulate readers' inner billows better than exciting dialogue. Andy's\u000aguilt to his wife has been released and got redemption after locking in\u000aShawshank prison for nineteen years.The heaviest burden of a person in\u000aone's lifetime is from inside rather than outside. Lots of lines in the\u000afilm are valuable for us to take our time to taste it. And everyone\u000ashall remember that hope is a good thing.\u000a

V\u000a\u000aSpoiler!!\u000aThe philosophical ebbs and flows of The Shawshank Redemption make it the\u000afinest movie of the last ten years. Andy is a ping pong ball of hope and\u000adespair, of assimilation and rejection.  The same is true of Red, but the\u000aphilosophical contrast between the two, and the way each is forced to\u000aconsider the other's viewpoint, is why this movie's message is so\u000apoignantly\u000adelivered.Andy, in his earliest prison days, is a loner, whose hope that his\u000anightmarish incarceration will not prove real delays his assimilatation\u000ainto\u000athe culture and society of Shawshank.  Ultimately, though, while clinging\u000ato\u000aan inner belief that Shawshank is not home, he realizes that, in\u000aassimilation, lies his only hope of coping with prison life.Contrastingly, Red, a long-term inmate whose once-a-decade parole\u000arejections\u000ahave become a ritual reminder of the fact that he has no hope of getting\u000aout\u000aof prison, has assimilated to the fullest possible extent, and clearly\u000aviews\u000aShawshank as home.Each is frequently exposed to the viewpoint of the other.  Red expresses\u000aconcern when Andy dreams of life in Mexico, but Andy takes exception when\u000aRed proclaims himself to be dependent on Shawshank for his livelihood.\u000aRed,\u000ain essence, suggests that Andy accept Shawshank as home.Red is selling despair and assimilation to Andy, but Andy is selling hope\u000aand rejection to Red.  When Andy escapes from Shawshank, Red's chance to\u000asell Shawshank to Andy evaporates, but it's impossible to tell whether\u000aAndy\u000ahas reached Red or not, and it appears that it doesn't really\u000amatter.The brilliant twist toward the end of The Shawshank Redemption is that it\u000ais\u000athe manifestation of his despair to the parole board that results in\u000aRed's\u000aparole.  Even in parole, however, Red finds despair in assimilation, the\u000asame despair that prompted Brooks to commit suicide some years earlier.\u000aOnly when he reads the note Andy left for him in the hayfields of Buxton\u000ais\u000aRed presented with a chance to pursue a course of hope and\u000arejection.Rejection, in this case, means parole violation, and results directly\u000afrom\u000aRed's, seemingly unprecedented, hope for a happy life.  When Red acts on\u000ahis\u000aimpulse and travels to Mexico to, presumably, live out his life alongside\u000athe greatest friend he has ever known, he, finally, buys into Andy's\u000aphilosophies about hope, despair, assimilation and rejection.In doing so, he provides a happy ending to a film that may live on\u000aforever\u000adue to the criticality of its subject matter and its masteful delivery of\u000aits message.\u000a

V\u000a\u000aThe Shawshank Redemption is a film about people, which is becoming\u000aincreasingly rare these days where movies merely showcase special effects or\u000aaction.The film seems slow but that is the point. It must convey the slow passage\u000aof time, as we see Andy and Red lives in the prison. Its a film that makes\u000aus think as well as feel, and that is what makes it truly\u000agreat.Tim Robbins' performance is incredible, making Andy out to be a complete\u000aperson with real thoughts and feelings. He IS Andy, not simply an actor\u000agoing through the motions. He is the film's heart.And That make's Morgan Freeman's Red it's soul. It is his point of view that\u000acarries us through the film, making Andy seem even more mysterious because\u000ahe is never quite sure what Andy is up to.A Wonderful film that suceeds on so many levels. A must see for anyone, even\u000aif you don't think you will like a film about prison that is so long and may\u000aseem slow. See it anyway! It earns its place on the top 250 list with heart\u000aand style. We watched it in a sociology class and it is the only movie I\u000ahave ever seen that has a climax capible of moving an entire room full of\u000ajaded college students to standing ovation. A true masterpiece!PS: In one of the scenes on the bus (I forget if it is when Brooks or Red\u000agets out) a woman with short reddish curly hair can be seen (At least in\u000awidescreen) She was my math teacher in high school, and most of the movie\u000awas filmed around my hometown of Mansfield. I just felt like mentioning\u000athis.\u000a

V\u000a\u000aTHE SHAWSHANK REDEMPTION ****A man sets out to scratch together some semblance of a life after he is\u000aconvicted of murdering his wife and her lover.  With the inmates taking bets\u000aon which one of the new prisoners will fall victim to the harsh environment,\u000athe movie evolves into a blossoming friendship between the convicted\u000amurderer and the prison handyman.  With a growing trust and bond that will\u000astand forever they begin to share in their experiences and over time the new\u000aprisoner becomes much more than just a friend; he becomes a man with vision\u000aand determination whilst also using the system to his benefit by applying\u000ahis professional experience within the prison.  The Shawshank Redemption is a masterpiece portraying the issues that we\u000aexpect a movie of this calibre to portray, whilst also developing sub-plots\u000awith such precision that the entire movie felt like it passed in double\u000aquick time.  Rarely do I get the feeling that a movie was totally seamless,\u000abut this was one instance.  The acting was first rate, with both Robbins and\u000aFreeman putting in the performances of a lifetime.  I must admit I haven't\u000asee much of Robbins' work, but if all his other performances slump to deep\u000amediocrity he will still be remembered for his part here.  Freeman was\u000asuperb as the inmate who has come to terms with Shawshank, believing that\u000ahope springs futility and that Shawshank becomes an institutionalised aspect\u000aof a mans' character, whether inside or out.  To focus on just two people would be ludicrous, there are a number of other\u000aoutstanding contributions from the prison rule makers and the band of men\u000athat keep morale high enough to contemplate living on through their\u000asentences.  The movie triggered a number of responses personally, the\u000aobvious responses of sadness and happiness can be taken for granted.  But\u000aemerging through the obvious were issues of friendship, trust, betrayal,\u000ahatred, anger and injustice.  So too was there joy and relief, and a new\u000aperspective on what life and prison means to many people that I previously\u000ahadn't thought of.  Personally, one of the saddest moments I can remember from all of the movies\u000aI have seen involves an old book-keeper who has to come to terms with\u000afreedom.  For those that have seen it you'll probably concur that it was\u000adeeply touching; for those who haven't seen the movie you may see a fresh\u000ainsight into prison life.  It is a wonderfully crafted film, and whilst I\u000ahate banding extreme and blind accolades at movies that can be taken as\u000afads, this will probably stay in my top five favourite movies for it's\u000aenjoyment, its direction and it's comprehensive grasp of so many of it's\u000afocus points.  An outstanding movie.\u000a\u000a

V\u000a\u000aThis is one of the greatest films of the 20th Century,Its a drama, Its a buddy picture, Its a prison movie,\u000aIt's strange thinking of The Shawshank Redemption as a buddy picture\u000athough,\u000aespecially when you consider that Andy's friend Red is a convicted and an\u000aadmitted murderer and yet Red seems so gentle and trustworthy, also the\u000aother guys in Red's group such as Heywood seem nice as well and we dont\u000aeven\u000aknow what crimes those guys committed but when you watch this movie you\u000adont\u000aeven ask yourself what crimes they committed, you just assume it's\u000amurder.watching the friendships development in this film is really moving,\u000awatching\u000aRed worrying about Andy the night and day after Andy Escapes just proves\u000athat they were more like brothers than friends,The Shawshank Redemption is the only movie I have ever given 10/10 or a\u000afive\u000astar rating out of 5, I first watched this film when I was 14 years old\u000aand\u000aloved it then, im 20 now and I love it even more,\u000athis is my number 1 movie of all time.Perfectly casted, directed and edited.\u000aAn American Classic.\u000a

V\u000a\u000aFor a movie about a subject as broad and powerful as prison, this movie felt\u000adecidedly flat;  there were "bad" guys and "good" guys and no-one in\u000abetween.  It follows a familiar trajectory and in my opinion, does not\u000aachieve anythign new on the cinematic or storytelling front.  The sotry\u000aitself?  Well, its simple feel-good melodrama.  As hard as this might be to\u000aimagine, life in the prison is idealized.  It's a stereotypical American\u000astory of righteous triumph that does little to stir emotions or provoke\u000athought.\u000a

V\u000a\u000aThis movie is ridiculously overrated on this list, and I think that I know\u000awhy. This is the kind of movie that appeals to men who feel like they are\u000awimpy and can't get over, but, in this movie, are able to get over. I'm\u000asorry that we men have to worry so much about our manhood.Anyway, Andy Dufresne is such a character. He takes all kinds of abuse,\u000abut\u000astill gets over in the end. The story is somewhat interesting, but King's\u000acharacters tend to be superficial, and you only find out about them\u000athrough\u000aanecdotes and action rather than through emotional expression (except\u000aperhaps Dolores Claiborne). Darabont doesn't do much to fill them out. Who\u000ais Red outside of the anecdotes? I only relate to him through Andy, who\u000aseems to be pretty one-dimensional as well. With the long, progressive\u000astory, there should be better character development, but no. I feel that\u000athese characters are kept at arms length, unless they are getting hammered\u000aor getting over. Not satisfying to me.This morality play goes on too long and is not paced particularly well,\u000athough the ending is satisfying, and there are moments of true pathos. The\u000aacting is good but not exceptional. The narration holds things together,\u000abut\u000abecomes tiresome. The best thing about it is the cinematography, which is\u000aquite exceptional. Roger Deakins is a powerhouse.There are loads of movies that cover similar ground (such as "Emperor of\u000athe\u000aNorth" or "Cool Hand Luke") and come out much better. I've happened to see\u000ait twice now, and overall, I'd give about a 6/10. \u000a

V\u000a\u000aMany people ask the fatidic question: why does this movie is ranked second\u000abest movie of all time???  But I believe that most of them have miss the\u000apoint: we don't love movie because its `cool' or because one is more\u000a`intellectual' or anything else; no, we love movie when they leave to us a\u000apowerful message. So yes, this movie is quit simple, the plot is basic,\u000athe\u000aactors are ok, but not exceptional but the image that stay in your mind at\u000athe end is a message of hope, it shows you that sometimes, in our life,\u000aour\u000abeliefs are more important than anything else; that we must choose the\u000adeepest way to succeed in what we expect to shine, because hope is the\u000alast\u000athing to die.10/10\u000a\u000a

V\u000a\u000aI finally saw this movie.  I wanted to rent it after seeing this is the\u000anumber two favorite movie of all time.  But I could never find it in the\u000avideo store or library.  Of all places, I finally saw it on television!\u000aIn\u000athe age of predictable plots, I could not predict this movie at all until\u000athe very last few seconds it reveals the events.  We watch movies for the\u000atruth and there are lots in this one.  There are some valuable lessons\u000ahere:\u000anever lose hope, always do your best wherever you go, persistence,\u000apersistence.\u000a

V\u000a\u000aWhile a successful writer, Stephen King has a bad reputation when it comes\u000ato the film versions of his work. "Children of the Corn" and "Maximum\u000aOverdrive" are some of the most frequently cited examples of how difficult\u000ahis stories are to translate to film. Granted, there have been exceptions,\u000asuch as "Misery" and "The Green Mile," that have won critical and commercial\u000aacclaim, but these are relatively few and far in-between. As a rule, his\u000anon-horror writings tend to work better on celluloid. Still, no one, not\u000aeven King himself, could have predicted the overwhelming praise bestowed\u000aupon "The Shawshank Redemption," helmed by a then-unknown\u000adirector.If you're looking for cheap thrills and "boo" moments, you won't find them\u000ahere. Unlike Darabont's "Green Mile," there are not even any elements of the\u000asupernatural. The focus is on the relationship between a man wrongfully\u000aimprisoned, and the inmate he befriends. In later scenes, the story takes\u000asome intriguing twists and turns, in classic Stephen King fashion. What\u000ahappens I will not reveal, but the screenplay is clever at making everything\u000acome together in the end. Despite the grimness of prison life, all is not\u000alost. In fact, one marvels at how Andy did such a good job in making the\u000abest of his situation.Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman deliver subtle but effective performances,\u000amaking everything absolutely believable. Kudos, also, to the fine supporting\u000aperformances of Bob Gunton and William Sadler.So far, this is the best Stephen King film I've seen.***1/2 (out of ****)Released by Castle Rock through Columbia Pictures\u000a

V\u000a\u000aI gave this film a 7 over all.\u000aI think it was very well filmed and acted, but perhaps that's my problem\u000awith it - there's the 'feeling' that you're watching something 'significant'\u000abut the aura it seems to generate seems out of line with the proportion and\u000aevents of the story.\u000aBut, then that's the magic of cinema, and it _did_ pull the wool over\u000apeople's eyes (therefore the 9's and 10's in the poll).I was especially impressed as I'm not a King fan (either on paper or any\u000afilm/miniseries adaptations i've seen) and wasn't expecting much from this,\u000abut the narrative and characterisation are fairly strong (again, if out if\u000async with the film's "feel")\u000a\u000a

V\u000a\u000aThough I really enjoyed this movie, never would I agree that it is best\u000afilm\u000aever.  It's powerful and full of heart, but it lacks one thing which is\u000aextremely important in a good film: originality.  Tim Robbins and Morgan\u000aFreeman were excellent in this film but their relationship is much like\u000athe\u000arelationship between Clint Eastwood and the librarian in "Escape From\u000aAlcatraz."  The involvement of the library, the old coon who dies (Doc),\u000athe\u000abrut who is a threat (Wolf), the hole, the oppressive warden, and the\u000aescape\u000ain general all come from "Escape From Alcatraz."  Though "Escape From\u000aAlcatraz" is not as powerful and emotional as "The Shawshank Redemption,"\u000ait\u000ais a brilliantly done film and has the originality which "Shawshank"\u000alacks.\u000aThough I do not want to belittle those who worship "Shawshank," I would\u000asuggest that anyone who has seen it should rent "Escape From Alcatraz."\u000aThen you may think twice before calling "Shawshank" the greatest film\u000aever.\u000a

V\u000a\u000aFrank Darabont's "The Shawshank Redemption" is a film of pretentious\u000aplatitudes and obvious intentions.  Based on Stephen  King's short story\u000a"Rita Hayworth and the Shawshank Redemption", the film stars Tim Robbins as\u000aAndy Dufresne, a banker wrongly accused of murdering his adulterous wife and\u000aher lover.  Morgan Freeman delivers a much-deserved Academy-Award nominated\u000aperformance as the hardened Red, the convict responsible for smuggling\u000acigarettes into the penitentiary whose genuine depth allows him to form a\u000afriendship with Andy not based on the macho rules of the prison yard (Andy's\u000ademeanor is in face so falsely naive that many of the prisoners bet on him\u000ato be the first under pressure) but on a continuing sense of willpower and\u000amotivation in a place that genuinely lacks the atmosphere for such human\u000aemotions.And yet whereas "The Shawshank Redemption" is in itself an honorable\u000apredilection of prison life and shows an understanding of the human spirit\u000awhich is somehow lacking in the more recent prison movies (most notably Tom\u000aSelleck's "An Innocent Man" and Sylvester Stallone's "Lock Up"), the film is\u000adeemed exceptional only by your willingness to surrender to Darabont's\u000apredictable machinations.  Darabont may be a talented screenwriter, and some\u000aof his creations here (such as the character played by William Sadler, who\u000acomes across during an inventory inspection a copy of "The Count of Monte\u000aCristo" by Alexander...Dumbass) are unmistakeably human, his portrayal of\u000athe Bible-thumping warden (Bob Gunton) cannot resist but to relegate itself\u000ato stereotype. The film's real downfall is in Tim Robbins' performance, who\u000adespite his squeaky-clean cherub face cannot project the inspiration needed\u000ato give this film its realistic element.  And yet this is not a bad movie,\u000ajust certainly not the best movie of all time.  Some images of the movie\u000awill continue to stay with me:\u000athe cold-hearted sexual depravity of "the Sisters"; and in the\u000ainfamous shot beautifully and rigidly painted by cinematographer Roger\u000aDeakins ("Fargo"), Dufresne basking in a downpour upon entering freedom.\u000aUnfortunately, the film isn't cohesive enough to warrant any more of those\u000amoments.\u000a

V\u000a\u000aThis has to be one of the best, if not the best, movie I have ever seen.\u000aCombining the masterful acting skills of Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman,\u000aFrank Darabont blends empathy with brutal physical and emotional violence to\u000athe best possible effects. The chemistry between Robbins and Freeman is\u000awonderful, whilst clinical, precise and realistic writing from Stephen King\u000aensures that this is one of the most worthy candidates for Movie of the\u000aDecade. If you only ever see one movie for the next 10 years, see this\u000aone. \u000a

V\u000a\u000aI am happy to know that I am not the only one who thinks this is one of the\u000abest movies of all time. It's my personal favorite. It shows the\u000adetermination of a person to live his life. How he works for years on his\u000aescape tunnel. The subplot of the parallel life outside of prison of Brooks\u000aand Freeman's character is excellent. I don't think any part of the movie is\u000abad, not even avarage. It's perfect from beginning to end. The only probable flaw\u000aI see in it is that it makes criminals look better than they actually are,\u000abut that's the point.\u000a

V\u000a\u000aIn my opinion, it deserves to be in AFI's top 10 of all time. Just one of\u000athose extremely rare movie experiences. The highest compliment I can pay it\u000ais that every movie I have watched since Shawshank has paled in comparison.\u000aI've never been so involved in a movie from beginning to end. And the ending\u000ais so incredible it provides inner joy you can't even express. Gump was very\u000agood and won Oscars because of the hype and $$$ it spent & collected. But,\u000aShawshank with no special effects or high priced productions provided better\u000ascript, plot development, acting and ending than 99.9% of Hollywood films\u000abefore and probably after it. Totally under-appreciated\u000amasterpiece.. \u000a

V\u000aThe Shawshank Redemption is an excellent example of Hollywood\u000acraftsmanship. It has believable acting, excellent pacing, good\u000acinematography and tells the story in a very effective manner. But it\u000ais film as a craft, not as an art.To put this film in the same category as those of Kubrick, Kurosawa,\u000aTruffaut or Bergman is like comparing a piece of quality furniture to a\u000aPicasso.I doubt even one in a hundred people, who hold this film in such high\u000aregard as to vote it #2, could actually name the director if you asked\u000athem in the street.\u000a

Black guy is happy. Everyone who voted high for this should\u000awatch Animal Factory by Steve Buscemi. It isnt a great film but it offers\u000aa\u000afar more powerful realistic look into penitentiary life than Shawshank.\u000akev\u000a

V\u000a\u000aMy impression is that since the early ninenties and especially  after\u000a"green\u000afried tomatoes" was released movies regarding human relations and/or\u000atragedy\u000aand using narative as their spine became fashionable..Countless movies\u000afollowed that i dont care to mention most of them inferior than the\u000aoriginal\u000athey tried to follow and one of them is Shawshank redemption.Sure it is\u000anot\u000aa mellow love story but about life in prison that is objectively hard.But\u000asomehow the typical ingredients are there.The film is mostly sad and\u000amelodramatic and one can even consider it romantic in a way.Despite its\u000astrong cast and a good storyline it does not avoid all these\u000acharacteristic\u000acliches that sadly deprive it from any real replay value.Rent it on dvd\u000aand\u000ayou wont be disapointed by viewing it but the second best movie of all\u000atimes\u000ait aint and you will know this because you wont feel the need to watch it\u000anow and then as it happens at least to me  with movies that are really\u000aclassics...Not a bad movie but highly overrated....3 out of five\u000astars.\u000a

V\u000aThis movie is a fine way to spend 140 minutes, but is by no means a\u000amovie of the first rank. The script is far too simplistic,\u000acliché-ridden and predictable. The characters are far too good guy/bad\u000aguy dualistic; and for a story purporting to take place over the course\u000aof 20 years, there is remarkably little character development. And,\u000ajust about every really evil character gets his comeuppance, whereas\u000athe people we're supposed to be rooting for end up in clover. Hmmmm....Among prison movies, Cool Hand Luke is better--more realistic, and\u000awithout the obligatory Hollywood feel-good ending. Runaway Train and\u000aPapillon are also very good, certainly more interesting. Among\u000ainspirational movies, last year's October Sky is a better bet.In a nutshell: tremendously overrated, but certainly worth seeing.\u000a

V\u000a\u000aThe evangelical adoration this film has earned is lost on me.  Like so many\u000apopular films of recent years, "Shawshank" is an obvious, cliche-riddled\u000aepic that's won fans because it plays it safe.  Characters are either\u000asaintly or satanic.  There's no room for shades of gray.  Sure its\u000asumptuously filmed.  A $50 million budget can do that.  Add the always solid\u000aMorgan Freeman, a paper-thin moral about hope, and you've got a film longing\u000ato be loved.  Obviously, plenty of people do.But compared to Freeman, Tim Robbins' vanilla performance as the\u000along-suffering innocent (dare I say Christ-like) man trapped in purgatory\u000acomes off bland.  Clancy Brown as the sadistic prison guard is the worst\u000acliche of the all.  When you toss in the obligatory prison rapes, the\u000acorrupt warden, and James Whitmore (who is very good) as the veteran inmate\u000aunprepared for life outside the institution, you've got a predictable film\u000athat only snaps to life near its plot-holed conclusion.   Worse of all, Frank Darabont directs the works at half-speed. This is a\u000apainfully overlong concoction.In time, "The Shawshank Redemption" will be regarded as a well-crafted but\u000ashallow prison film.  \u000a

V\u000a\u000aSo there I was, relaxing one Sunday evening in front of the TV.  Suddenly an\u000aadvert for "The Shawshank Redemption" appeared - it was on in an hour on\u000aChannel 4 (fourth out of five for you non-Brits).  I thought, "Hey, I\u000aremember that film.  It's number one in the IMDB ratings."  I always\u000awondered why - I remember watching it a few years ago and thinking it was\u000apretty good.  So I thought I would sit myself down and watch the thing\u000aproperly...  Thank God I did.  That film is absolutely fantastic.  I sat\u000arivetted for the full two and bit hours of it.  The sheer complexity of the\u000aplot, the twists, the character development.  The ending.  You can sort of\u000aunderstand why it got nominated for so many Oscars.  As I mentioned earlier\u000aI always wondered why this film seems to have spent most of its time at the\u000atop of the IMDB chart - not Star Wars, the Godfather, Citizen Kane even.\u000aNow I know.  I suppose most of the people who have read this far would know\u000ahow good this film is - but if not, here's my advice.  Watch this\u000afilm!\u000a

V\u000aMany folk rate Shawshank Redemption as one of the best films they have\u000aever seen. I'm not so impressed. Firstly, I agree that the absence of\u000aspecial effects is a boon in any 1990s film. Secondly, Freeman and\u000aRobbins act well and are well-directed. The storyline, though, lacks\u000asubtlety (not in the telling - this is a very well directed film - but\u000aas a story) and Dufesne comes over as a kind of everything-he-touches,\u000aincarcerated upper-middle class Forrest Gump. The film is suffused with\u000aa kind of Manichean morality which tips over too readily into\u000asentimentality (again, despite the best efforts of Freeman and Robbins)\u000aand which, ultimately, I found cloying.Perhaps, though, I'm being too harsh. Is it just that the film is a lot\u000abetter than the story from which it is taken? Rita Hayworth: eat your\u000aheart out?\u000a

V\u000aShawshank Redemption is a story of, well, Redemption. Just like any\u000afilm from Quentin Tarantino, but with an extra dose of melodrama.\u000aOrchestral music to drive you to tears, overly dramatic dialog, and\u000aplot twists that come so far out of left field even M. Night Shylamalan\u000awould cringe. You just have a hard time seeing them, because the movie\u000ais relatively laid back.Which is the best part of the film. It slows down whenever it needs to\u000atake its time. It's the story of two prisoners who bond over. One is a\u000awrongfully accused man hoping to find a way out. One is a man who has\u000agiven up all hope. And random acts of kindness help them earn their\u000aredemption.See, it's about Redemption. It's in the title. No use thinking about\u000athe theme. Morgan Freeman is perfectly cast in this film, and gives one\u000aof the best performances in his life. But every one of his lines is not\u000athe line of a prisoner, but somebody who has been paid to pretend to be\u000aa prisoner.The movie lacks any sense of reality, from the poorly supervised chain\u000agang, to the subplot of the sinister warden, and even down to the fact\u000athat a man is allowed to keep a tool made for chipping away rocks in\u000ahis cell.The film would have worked as a stage play easily. Because we expect\u000athis detachment from reality. But this film likes to pretend this is\u000areality. The film also likes to make conclusive statements, and then\u000aimmediately retract them.This movie has a heart. It spills out all over the screen while we\u000awatch the characters monologue, getting to the point of the movie over\u000aand over again. Long movies never bothered me. On the contrary, I think\u000ait's a shame four hour movies never get released these days. Still,\u000awhen it's two and a half hours plus of monologues reiterating the same\u000aplot point, it's two and a half hours too much.\u000a

Well I've\u000agot\u000anews for you, look again. The Shawshank Redemption is a very good movie,\u000ai\u000aagree but is it all it's cracked up to be? - no. At first you think "I\u000afeel\u000agreat - what a feel-good movie!" One can't help wondering that this film,\u000aon\u000acloser inspection, is actually unbelievably cheesy. Every other second i\u000awas\u000ahearing violins about how this poor guy got landed in jail for a murder\u000ahe\u000adidn't commit. It's stereotypical - and you guys who voted 10 bought it\u000ahook, line and sinker. "But what about the great twist?" O.k., the twist\u000awas\u000agood but come on...like i said before was it THAT great? Ask yourselves\u000ahonestly, was that better than The Sixth Sense's or The Usual Suspects?\u000aAlso, how come foreign films which are far superior to this get no\u000acredit?\u000aWatch Le Samurai, or La Haine or Todo Sobre Mi Madre. Far more\u000asuperior.\u000a\u000a

V\u000a\u000aI hadn't seen this film until today and I never would have rented it if I\u000ahadn't seen that it was so high up on the top 250. It wouldn't have been a\u000agreat loss. It's a pretty good movie, but a bit sappy for my taste. Gives\u000ayou lots of warm feelings inside about persistence through adversity, hope,\u000afriendship and all that good stuff. If you're into that, it is very well\u000aput\u000atogether and it features some good acting and a beautiful score. Oh, and --\u000athis could be considered a SPOILER given that it's a prison movie -- the\u000aending is so nice and so predictable and so cute and so corny, it just\u000ahurts. Art, it is not.\u000a

V\u000a\u000aThe good points of this movie have already been stated in the other posts,\u000aso I will stick to the points I feel detracted from the\u000amovie.\u000aThis movie never gripped me, I never really felt all that emotionally\u000ainvolved with the characters.  Even though 19 years passed in the story, I\u000anever got the sense of time passing as I have in other movies that have\u000astorylines that span decades.  All the characters who weren't prisoners were\u000avery one-dimensional.  Overall, it was a pretty good movie, but I don't\u000athink it belongs in the top 250.\u000a

V\u000a\u000aOk, so this isn't exactly a bad film, but it's extremely hard to see why it\u000aholds the no.2 position in the top 250 films. The acting is fine, the twist\u000ais gratifying (if a little predictable) and some of the shots are\u000afantastic.\u000aHowever, the film is let down by unrealistic dialogue, especially on the\u000apart of Freeman's character, who does not seem able to construct a sentence\u000awithout using a string of metaphors and similes.The prison warder is a one-dimensional villain with very little allure -\u000awe,\u000athe viewers, are not credited with much intelligence. Because he is a\u000avillain, it therefore follows that he must a be a Nazi, no? Cue references\u000ato book-burning etc. Furthermore, the portrayal of Tim Robbins' character\u000aas\u000aChrist is slightly offensive (check out the shot in which he is shown with\u000ahis arms thrown up to heaven).In true Hollywood style, there seems to be about five 'endings' - when we\u000athink that the excitement (or otherwise) is over, another sequence is\u000atagged\u000aonto the end. Despite some fairly violent scenes, life inside Shawshank\u000aseems actually rather appealing - a library, plenty of time outside the\u000acells. This, combined with the film's massive length, means that for my\u000amind, The Shawshank Redemption merits only a 6/10.\u000a\u000a

V\u000aDon't get me wrong - I liked this movie just fine, I just don't\u000aunderstand how it deserves the *heaps* of rapturous praise it regularly\u000areceives from IMDb members, and the fact that is has been ranked at #2\u000ain the hallowed IMDb Top 250 for the past 8 years or so just baffles\u000ame. It was certainly entertaining enough, and very well-acted, but also\u000away over-long, and filled with the usual stock characters that seem to\u000ainhabit every prison drama (if Hollywood movies are to be believed,\u000aprison wardens are mainly just nasty SOB's and the inmates are just the\u000abest bunch of guys you'd ever want to meet). I'd recommend the movie as\u000aa good renter, but I guess I can't see it as any more than that. I\u000arealize I am way in the minority on this, however.\u000a

V\u000aHow this is ranked higher than the Godfather I have no idea. I think\u000aIMDb had 90% of those votes for 10/10. THIS IS NOT THE BEST MOVIE EVER.\u000aThe Godfather changed cinema forever, with incredible actors from both\u000amale and female. Its great story, its memorable quotes, to a even\u000abetter ending for both of them. Written by Stephen King, this is not\u000ahis best movie based story, films like "The Shining" with Jack\u000aNicolson. "The Green Mile" with Tom Hanks. If you want to see a Stephen\u000aKing movie, those two would be definite titles. "The Green Mile" tops\u000a"The Shawshank Redemption" by a long shot. I'm a huge movie fan and I\u000adon't see anything in this film that would want for me to give it any\u000ahigher ranking than 3.\u000a

V\u000a\u000aThis movie is a mystery to me. I couldn't find anything exceptional on it.\u000aIt's another HBO stuff, without any aesthetic achievement and It's\u000aabsolutely conformist. But there is a fact: people love it. I want to be\u000afair: the movie is OK, but people put it in the same place than The\u000aGodfather! Maybe I'm wrong, but it's not the best picture of all the\u000atimes,\u000anot even the best prison picture of all the times. Now I'm remembering\u000a"Cool\u000aHand Luke" or "American Me", they are stronger and wiser. But..people has\u000athe last word.\u000a

V\u000a\u000aHave watched the thing twice and frankly I still don't have a clue what\u000athe\u000afuss is all about. There's hardly anything special about the movie, let\u000aalone breathtaking, intriguing or groundbreaking. The beginning is\u000asomewhat\u000apromising, but pretty soon it all gets painfully predictable right down to\u000athe moment the credits start rolling. The narrative is way too often\u000aoverdrawn and phoney, the music - heavily pretentious and irritating. The\u000aperformances are not bad, but let's face it - the script is far from\u000ademanding. The storytelling is overwhelmingly fairytale-ish and even the\u000adrastic bits seem oddly out of the place, as if thrown in to make the\u000athing\u000afeel more dramatic. Words keep flowing in abundance, soothingly creating\u000athe\u000aimpression of a nap story told by a lit fireplace. Having recently watched\u000athe ingenious "The Straight Story" I was astonished to see how much damage\u000amay be done to a picture by putting in too much talk.All that is not to say the movie is appaling. However, an inch above\u000aaverage\u000ais as good as it gets. Both "Midnight Express" and "Escape From Alcatraz"\u000abeat the weepy Shawshank experience hands down. 6/10.\u000a\u000a

V\u000a\u000aOriginally, I wrote a very long review of Shawshank Redemption,\u000abut i've decided not to post it.  Instead i'd just like to say that i\u000awould\u000acompare the movie to a poem that i wrote in 5th grade.  i'm not\u000agoing to write the poem out because i don't have it with me right\u000anow, but it had to do with rainbows and waterfalls and following\u000ayour dreams.\u000aIn other words, it was complete b.s. I just wrote what i\u000athought were some typical poetic themes and threw them together,\u000ahoping people would like it.  My plan succeeded, the teacher\u000athought it was the best in the class, and it got published in the\u000aschool newspaper.\u000aSeems like the director of The Shawshank Redemption,\u000aFrank Darabont, and the writer of the book, Stephen King, did the\u000asame thing.  The movie is technically well made and does\u000asucceed at telling the story.  I admit that I got caught up in the\u000aending.  But no matter how much you try to defend it, it's still pure\u000aHollywood.  Cliche here and there.  I recognize this for what it is:  a\u000adirector's attempt to manipulate people's emotions, which, due to\u000aa large amount of naivite in the world, succeeds.  He did the same\u000athing with The Green Mile with more success.  Now, with The\u000aMajestic, I am glad to see that it seems that most reviewers and\u000amany moviegoers have recognized this, and given it generally\u000alower reviews than his first two films.  Finally!  Now I only hope\u000apeople will start to give Shawshank lower ratings and get it down\u000afrom the heights of the top 250 list.\u000a

V\u000a\u000aI quite like this film but it wouldn't make my top 100. The idea it's the\u000agreatest film in history is laughable.Of course the acting's terrific. Morgan Freeman and Tim Robbins are solid\u000aas\u000aever, even if Bob Gunton and Clancy Brown (the Baddies) chew the scenery.\u000aAnd that's the problem - everything is so terribly black and white, with\u000aevery character springing straight out of a three word summary. Our hero\u000ais\u000aGood But Flawed, Red is Good And Noble, the Warden is Just Plain Bad and\u000ahis\u000ahenchman is Reminiscent Of Another Film (okay, four words).I've never been inside a prison, but I can't believe all the prisoners\u000awould\u000abe so damn nice. There's the "sisters" - a bunch of horrid rapists, of\u000acourse, but they're nothing a small plot contrivance can't eliminate. The\u000a"sisters" aside, there's nary a cross word from a prisoner in the whole\u000afilm.Racism is also curiously absent. American prisons today are notorious\u000ahot-beds of racism. Martin Luther King's dream is bizarrely alive and well\u000ain Shawshank, where colour doesn't get a mention in twenty years of\u000a"history".This total lack of realism means it's not really a film about prison at\u000aall.\u000aAnd\u000awhat kind of "character" film can be centred around someone who seems\u000aentirely flawless (other than perhaps in his choice of\u000aattorney).I can whinge about the mechanics of the film as well. Voiceover narration\u000ais\u000airritating enough - but Red narrating events at which he was not present?\u000aPur-lease. And that final scene - talk about a director who didn't know\u000awhen\u000ato shout "cut". It didn't need much self control to stop at the point Red\u000aheads towards Mexico - films for grown-ups shouldn't need endings that\u000aresolve any uncertainty.Speaking of the director, isn't it odd how the maker of the "Greatest film\u000ain the world ever" is also credited for The Fan, Eraser, The Blob and The\u000aFly II? It's as if Orson Welles directed "Plan 9 from Outer Space", or\u000aFrancis Ford Copolla helmed "Megaforce".I don't mean to make this out to be a bad film - it's far from that. But\u000aanyone who rates it the greatest ever should try "Godfather",\u000a"Goodfellas",\u000a"Citizen Kane", "Casablanca" - something, anything that's not so *worthy*.\u000a\u000a

V\u000a\u000aThat this film ranks as No2 in the 'all time' list on IMDB says a lot for\u000ahow folks don't watch films from any era before the 90s anymore, for how\u000aelse could it genuinely sit atop that list? I suppose in an age where\u000aeverything on amazon gets at least four stars, good subjective criticism\u000ais\u000aproving harder and harder to find...but really...is this film better than\u000aChinatown? Better than Casablanca? The Third Man? Mean Streets? Withnail\u000aand\u000aI? Better than Adam's Rib, Singin' in the Rain, Rear Window, Day for\u000aNight,\u000aBande a Part, Taxi Driver, West Side Story, Les Quatre Cent Coups, Some\u000aLike\u000ait Hot, Seven Samurai?I've seen this film twice, once at the cinema and once on TV as I lie\u000astuffed with Xmas dinner. The first time was mildly enjoyable, the second\u000apretty turgid. Despite the presence of the ever excellent Robbins (though\u000aMorgan Freeman phones in the same performance he's given in every film\u000aever\u000asince), this film never transcends the humble source of its story - a\u000aStephen King short - and whilst it's a 'nice' tale with a reasonable twist\u000aat the end, can anyone else explain to me why such praise has been heaped\u000aon\u000athis utterly average experience?And it's not just IMDB. A recent UK Channel Four poll found Shawshank\u000aright\u000aup there. Perhaps it's the combination of pseudo-harsh prison story and a\u000abuddy tale along with the lashings of on the nose humanism that appeals\u000aacross genders and other boundaries. I don't know. But believe me, if this\u000awere the 2nd best film ever made in the world ever, let's just say cinema\u000awouldn't be the popular influence it is today.Go out there, people. Find the true 'classics', find the films this piece\u000aof\u000asentimentalia stole its every beat, every note, every word of dialogue\u000afrom.\u000aAnd then come back and tell me this is anything other than a hotch potch,\u000aa\u000a50s throwback with a 90s sentiment.\u000a\u000a

V\u000a\u000a(slight spoilers, nothing crucial) This is a competent movie, but its presence in the rankings completely\u000abaffles me -- it might as well be 'The Pelican Brief'. Its scenes are schematics into which emotion might be put (for example, the\u000aschematic of the despairing ex-prisoner Red), but they lack the ragged\u000arichness of real feeling.  Where 'Kiss of the Spider Woman' overwhelms us,\u000athis shows us a series of events.\u000a\u000a

V\u000a\u000aI found this movie to be rather trivial and predictable.  It was, in many\u000aways, a Forrest Gump version of a prison movie.  It had a manipulative and\u000asuperficial plotline, and the leading character was too good to be true.\u000aIt\u000anever dealt deeply with any issue at all.  Basically, you liked the leading\u000acharacter because he was perfect, and cheered him on and hoped for his\u000asuccess, just like Forrest Gump.  However, unlike Forrest Gump, I could\u000anever see the true emotion of the Tim Robbins character.  He didn't like\u000abeing sexually assaulted, but we never saw how that affected him; he didn't\u000adrink but got beers for his friends.  He finds pleasure out of the simple\u000athings and doesn't like unpleasurable things.  He turned out to be a\u000aperfect\u000acharacter with no negative qualities at all.  Maybe he's this way for a\u000areason; people can relate to him because they like to think of themselves\u000abeing completely perfect and think they would make every right decision if\u000athey were in a situation like this.In many senses, this was just a morality play, with Andy Dufresne being\u000aentirely good and all the prison officials being completely bad.  I think\u000athe only reason why people enjoy this movie so much is that it has the\u000amessage "Good things come to those that try and do good with their lives."\u000aHowever, I didn't think the movie had enough substance to offer any deeper\u000ameaning or insight.  The best thing about this movie was it made me realize\u000ahow great of a movie Forrest Gump is and how great of an actor Tom Hanks\u000ais.\u000aHe made the Forrest Gump character seem to have a fully round personality\u000aand allowed us to understand who he was.  He seemed possible.  Andy seems\u000aunlikely and not relatable because we never see any reasoning behind his\u000apersonality.This movie moves people because it is a heroic fable.  It's not a worthless\u000amovie experience, but it should have done more with what it already had.\u000aTo the people that think this is the greatest movie ever made...spare me.\u000aMy rating 4/10.\u000a

V\u000a\u000aLittle more than average drama for popular tastes.\u000aPredictable,  overly sentimental, and excessively long.It's a mystery to me that such a mediocre piece of cinematic art is\u000aat number 2 in the all time chart! However, predictably it's not in the\u000atop 100 more serious 'Sight and Sound'  critics and directors polls\u000athat are held every  ten years. Frank Darabont later proved to be no\u000amaster with his two following films, the second rate 'The Green\u000aMile' and the truly appalling 'The Majestic'. The fact that this\u000apedestrian movie is, in this chart, ahead of the works of  real\u000amasters such as Kubrick, Welles, Kurosawa, Fellini and Hitchcock\u000acauses consternation.\u000a

V\u000a\u000a!!Spoilers to this movie, as well as to Sixth Sense and Citizen Kane just\u000afor spite!!Shawshank Redemption is one of those movies that oozes with "give me an\u000aOscar pleeeeeease" all over it. You know the type  - like "Dances with\u000aWolves." Oversentimental and overlong. It's surprising that this movie has\u000asuch a high imdb ranking considering it's such a very black and white\u000a(prisoners=good, prison-keepers=evil) movie rehashing what's been hashed\u000aand\u000ahashed many times.The story concerns an apparently-wrongly-convicted banker Andy Dufresne\u000a(Tim\u000aRobbins) who is sentenced to life at Shawshank Prison in that creepiest of\u000astates, Maine, for murdering his wife and her lover. His main 'friend' at\u000aShawshank is wily old-time-prisoner named Red (Morgan Freeman). Nobody can\u000adeny that Morgan Freeman is one of the greatest actors ever, and I'm not\u000agoing to. Tim Robbins also gives a performance that one wouldn't guess he\u000ahad in him by watching, say, "Nothing to Lose" (which nevertheless is a\u000abetter movie). And the supporting cast is all excellent in roles that are\u000aincredibly one-dimensional. Okay, that's it for the good. Here comes the\u000abad, and the ugly.Early on in the film, Red, who doubles as the narrator, tells us that\u000aalthough he'd like to tell us Andy wasn't gang-raped by some of the fellow\u000ainmates (the only bad inmates in there, by the way, and then they get sent\u000aaway, so that leaves only good ones) but he can't, cause "that'd be a\u000afairytale.  And there are no fairytales here at Shawshank." How wrong he\u000ais!\u000aThe whole movie is a fairytale (albeit without any of the excitement and\u000afast-pace of one).We get characters who are so completely good as to be Saints for our two\u000amain prisoners (and most of the other ones) and the Prison guards and\u000awarden\u000awho all seem to be variations on the evil stepmother from Cinderella and\u000athe\u000aevil stepmother from Snow White (heck, they're so evil, their intramural\u000abaseball team's name is the Marauders. Gee, I wonder if you people get the\u000ahidden message?).The story itself is about two-and-a-half hours of sadism (very slow-paced\u000asadism, mind you),\u000aan hour of philosophical jabbering that, frankly, is far inferior to a\u000aphilosophy class at the college if you're into that sort of thing (Hope is\u000aGood? Oh my God! What a revelation! Tell me more! Honestly, I've heard\u000asongs\u000awhich have more depth than this movie!)\u000aAnd half an hour of the ending.It's hard to talk about the faults of the movie without giving away the\u000aending, because, the ending itself is one of the main ones. All good movies\u000ahave an ending that makes you think (or at least are somewhat open to\u000ainterpretation, and/or sequels). But not this one. Although I counted at\u000aleast five or six points where the movie could have ended with leaving some\u000aroom for thought, it follows through to the bitter predictable end. It's as\u000aif it's saying "you know what, you viewers are all idiots, we better not\u000alet\u000ayou think about anything at all." Even if that was true, it's quite\u000ainsulting.  What's more is the ending is incredibly predictable. How could\u000ait not be, if it's told to you in the title of the movie? I mean, imagine\u000aif\u000athe Sixth Sense was called "The Dead Psychologist" or Citizen Kane was\u000acalled "The Sled" (sorry, imdb censorship guys, I know this makes your job\u000aharder, but I just can't think of a way to explain it otherwise).And I haven't even mentioned the worst part. This movie is incredibly long\u000aand boring. It's not a movie that is "slow" or "moves at its own pace" -\u000athose are alright by me. No, this movie, something is always happening, but\u000anot a single thing of interest. And like that for hours and hours and hours\u000aand hours and hours. Okay, that's a bit of an exaggeration. But\u000astill.Another thing is this movie's already-mentioned assumed self-importance.\u000aIt's irritating at the least. It's a long, boring, unoriginal version of\u000awhat Cinderella would be if somebody traded in all the women characters for\u000aswearing, rape and police brutality. I mean, frankly, Charles Perrot beat\u000ayou to it by four centuries, that's close to an all time record for\u000aunoriginality!\u000a

V\u000a\u000aI've been content to lurk and learn on this web site for months, but after\u000areading the reams of glowing critiques of this film, I felt obligated to\u000aget\u000aan IMDB account and print a contrary point of view.The Shawshank Redemption is an obvious, thinly characterized, visually\u000auncompelling film.  Whether it's the good guy/bad guy cliche or the  white\u000aguy/black guy cliche, it's still the same old Hollywood.This is not a film which discovers life through enigmas, dilemmas, and\u000areflections.  It is a film which wears its rather plain message on its\u000asleeve.3 out of 10.   For prison flicks try Dancer in the Dark.  Someone else\u000arecommended alternative prison flicks Kiss of the Spider Woman and Cool\u000aHand\u000aLuke.  I heartily agree with those choices.\u000a

V\u000a\u000aWhat's going on here? At the moment I am writing these words The Shawshank\u000aRedemption is 3rd in IMDb's all-time top250. I don't think the movie is\u000aparticularly bad, but to rank it even in the Top50 is a crime against a lot\u000aof brilliant film makers further down the Top250 and even more people whose\u000aworks don't even appear on the list!So now I ask if anybody can please explain to me:\u000a1) Why is this movie's average rating over 9? Does it appeal to some basic\u000aAmerican sense of justice and love of happy endings?\u000a2) Why did more than 65.000 people rate it? I'm pretty sure it wasn't\u000anearly\u000aas commercially succesful as The Lord of the Rings or the Godfather with\u000aabout 50000 votes. Did it do well on video in the US?And if you REALLY feel like watching movies about people behind bars why\u000anot\u000agive Cool Hand Luke or the 1974 classic(!) Caged Heat a\u000atry?I don't mean to demean The Shawshank Redemtion or anything, but I just\u000adon't\u000aget it's massive rating. Is this one of the most overrated movies of all\u000atime? Well, according to the statistics of this, the odds are that you do\u000anot think so. But would you then please be so kind as to explain it to me.\u000aFeel free to email me.\u000a\u000a

V\u000a\u000aThis movie is annoying in several ways.  The criminals are all\u000agoodhearted,\u000athoughtful, sensitive guys while the guards and warden are the REAL bad\u000aguys.  gimme a break.  What is this?  Dukes of Hazard? (which was far\u000abetter\u000athan this).  Further, the plot is so, so, so predicable.  Good guy\u000aoutsmarts\u000athe bad guys and real justice is served. spare me.  I know, a lot of\u000apeople\u000alove this flick, but in my humble opinion it is a big waste of\u000atime.\u000a

V\u000a\u000aSure it was a good prison movie, and much better than many other movies\u000aI've\u000aseen.  But this does NOT beat Godfather, Star Wars, or Casablanca in any\u000away.  Watch this if you enjoy good performances and good plot, but don't\u000aexpect a present-day classic ala Forrest Gump.  \u000a

V\u000aI watched this movie when I'm in college,it should be 9 years ago.\u000aThere's not so much fun in college,so when weekends come,some student\u000awill rent a movie CD and broadcast in classroom. One day my roommate\u000aand I are passing a classroom,find there's a movie on,we went in. In\u000athe beginning,we found it boring,but with the story moving on,we forgot\u000ato go back and obsessed by the story.After it ended,we asked the student who broadcast this CD which movie\u000ais it,and then came the name...The story is so encouragement\uff0cfull of positive,it teaches me that don't\u000agive up on what you want,and insist,try your best.You have to work hard for what you really want,and should never be\u000adefeated\u3002\u000a

V\u000aIt was a movie. I saw it.An actor is in it. He is a good actor.There are many scenes of dialogue, which I found confusing.Sometimes there is running and jumping. The jumping is good.Some people say it has a twist ending, but I thought it made perfect\u000asense.It reminded me a lot of another movie, but I don't know which one.When you watch the whole thing, you will know what happens.A lot of people say this movie made them cry, but I thought it was\u000ahappy.I kind of had to go to the bathroom when I watched this, I hope that\u000adoesn't spoil my opinion.\u000a

V\u000aI don't know about the other viewers but I personally think this is one\u000aof the greatest movies ever made.I usually don't have a great taste in\u000amovies and I really enjoy watching chick flicks and I get bored of\u000awatching some movies that actually have very good ratings on this\u000asite,but I think that if,me,a person with the worst taste in movies\u000aever liked this,then its a very great movie.I enjoyed it a lot and I\u000adidn't get bored at all...for the first time ever. I think everyone\u000ashould watch this movie. But am I the only one here who thinks that the\u000arating for this movie on this site is kinda low?I think it should be a\u000alittle higher...just saying. Anyways bottom line if you haven't watched\u000athis movie yet, you are wasting your life.So buy it and watch it.\u000aThat's all folks ;)\u000a

V\u000aDon't get me wrong, Shawshank is a good movie and should be on the top\u000a250 list, however be warned that this movie is way over-hyped and\u000ashould not be in the top 50 much less be number one. Yes the acting is\u000afantastic, Morgan Freeman is never anything less and Tim Robins\u000adelivers perfectly as well. Personally I think Freeman should have won\u000aan Oscar for his role over Tom Hanks in 1994. However his performance\u000ais the only truly great thing about this movie. The directing is OK and\u000athe script is good but not great. The actors aside from Freeman and\u000aGunton range from pretty good to "meh." Overall the movie does an\u000aalright job of getting me where it wants me emotionally. I was never\u000aoverflowing with passion for the characters but I did feel what I was\u000asupposed to feel about them. The movie however fails to really separate\u000aitself from other prison movies other than through some very strong\u000aperformances. For people to list a movie as the greatest of all time I\u000aexpect a lot more emotional connection to be brought forward, I expect\u000anearly flawless writing, great directing, and, probably most\u000aimportantly, something new. This movie brings none of this. Its good,\u000abut its not nearly THAT good.\u000a

V\u000aThis the most overrated movie I have seen, how this movie is number 1\u000aon IMDb is beyond me. Now this movie isn't bad it's just that the movie\u000ais so over rated that there are movies not in the top 250(Jurassic\u000aPark) that I'd rather watch than this. And that are more ground\u000abreaking than this movie was. Now the best part of this movie in my\u000aopinion is Morgan Freeman he is just SUCH a talented actor in the\u000aposition he plays in this movie. He is the main reason I watched this\u000amovie. This is not Morgan's best movie but certainly not his worst. The\u000areason I gave this a 7 is how over rated it is. I'm not saying I hate\u000athis movie, which I don't, I'm just shocked at the fact that its number\u000a1?! There are a lot more movies out there that deserve more credit than\u000athis film.\u000a

V\u000aI rated this movie a 6 mainly because not only is this based on a\u000aStephen King novel, but it is also IMDb's No.1 rated movie! I had very\u000ahigh expectations and presented this movie to watch with friends during\u000aour "movie night". I have to be honest, my high expectations did lead\u000ato a slight disappointment.I feel the movie was quite slow paced, it is about 2 and a quarter\u000ahours long and I felt a few parts could have been cut. The acting was\u000adefinitely excellent, Morgan Freeman delivers his best all the time and\u000athe storyline and plot were very clear. One main thing though is that I\u000adon't understand how almost everyone is rating this a 10/10 when I feel\u000athere are many more movies probably more deserving? Could be classified\u000aas a good movie, a really good movie but certainly not a great movie.\u000a

V\u000aThe Shawshank Redemption is an academy-award nominated 1994 film\u000astarring Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman.It was based on a short novella\u000aby Stephen King entitled "Rita Hayworth and Shawshank Redemption",\u000awhich was featured in the collection entitled "Different Seasons".This\u000anovella collection also includes the novellas which were later made\u000ainto the movies "Apt Pupil" and "Stand By Me".Stephen King is actually\u000amy favorite author and I really enjoyed the novella.Now for the movie.I\u000awatched it a few months ago and I found that it was very good.The\u000aacting is superb, Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman are great, the\u000astoryline, characters etc were all great.It is a great movie.However it\u000adefinitely does not deserve to be #1 on IMDb's Top 250 movie list or\u000aany top movie list for that matter.I liked the novella a bit more\u000athough there were some changes in the film that I liked better.The film\u000ais directed by Frank Darabont who would later make the amazing and\u000asuperior(in my opinion) "The Green Mile".Overall, Shawshank is\u000adefinitely one of the best prison movies of all time, though it is a\u000atad overrated.\u000a

V\u000aThought to be one of the greatest movies of all time and ranked 2nd on\u000aIMDb's list of top 250 movies ever created. When i first heard of this\u000afilm and its general plot i wasn't too enthusiastic about watching it.\u000aI mean, lets get serious... yet another prison movie where someone is\u000asupposedly wrongly accused for a crime he did not commit... we've seen\u000athem all. However, i can honestly and proudly admit that i was beyond\u000athe shadow of a doubt, completely and utterly wrong. This is truly an\u000aamazing movie. With its own charisma to it, it leaves the audience on\u000athe edge of their seats, wanting to find out more and waiting for the\u000aplot to unravel further. It captures your mind and truly speaks to you.\u000aOf course, a great deal of respect must be given to Morgan Freeman and\u000aTim Robin for their outstanding performances. This movie deserves to\u000ahave its own genre. A MUST see movie and a personal favorite.\u000a

V\u000aOne of my personal best films of all time, Directed by Frank Darabont\u000a(Screenplay for The Green Mile and The Blob) and wrote by Stephen King\u000a(Misery/The Shining). Morgan Freeman (Along Came A Spider/Se7en) plays\u000aan amazing roll alongside Tim Robbins (War of the Worlds/mystic river),\u000aas 2 inmates both serving life sentences at Shawshank Prison set in the\u000a1940s. I love the film from beginning to end. It has tension and\u000asuspense all the way through which builds up to one of the best endings\u000awhich you could possibly imagine,it has everything a decent film should\u000ahave. Bob Gunton (Broken Arrow/Demolition Man) plays a tough prison\u000awarden alongside Clancy Brown (Starship Troopers/The Hurricane). I have\u000anot added anything to this review which may spoil the film in any way,\u000ait is merely a review of my own, personal opinion, but i can tell you\u000athat you will not be disappointed with the film. thanks for reading,\u000ahope you enjoy the film has much as i did.\u000a

V\u000aTHE SHAWSHANK REDEMPTION has been hyped about for as long as since it\u000acame out. I was aware it was a great movie but to experience it is\u000aanother, great experience.Andy Dufresne, a young New England banker has been accused of the\u000amurder of his wife and her lover, Mr. Quentin. He is given two life\u000asentences to serve at Shawshank State Prison. Andy learns how to get\u000aabout his new life and serves through some tough experiences like being\u000athe sexual delight of a homosexual inmate. Despite this, he meets Ellis\u000aor also known as Red. Their friendship goes beyond simple friends.\u000aTheir insecurities and their desire for hope is what is what makes the\u000agreat, great ending to the story. It's inspiring and also extremely\u000aentertaining.The movie, although a modern masterpiece, may not be suitable for\u000achildren who aren't in their teens due to some prison elements. Around\u000a12 with parental guidance should be fine. Parents, once your kids are\u000athis age or older, this movie will have them talking about the values\u000aof life for a long time.\u000a

V\u000aI just saw this movie for the first time. My daughter watched it first\u000awhen she was 12 when it first came out. She went on and on about it\u000asaying how great it was then in about 1995. She also loved "Trading\u000aPlaces". I guess the moral of both of these stories is that the good\u000aguys win in the end. I now know what she was talking about. It is a\u000agreat movie, and I can see why it appeals to women.The movie is set in a prison, with the time old tradition of a close\u000afriendship over many years of an innocent young man as the hero and an\u000a"old lag" who knows all the ropes, in this case Tim Robbins and Morgan\u000aFreeman. This is the same formula earlier used in the films "The Count\u000aof Monte Cristo" and "An Innocent Man", both films which are highly\u000arecommended, if you liked this one.The film, although made in 1994, goes back to a time when good wins out\u000aover evil. unfortunately the fashion for a long time in the nineties\u000amovies was for bad to win out, as in "the Terminator" and other movies.\u000aThe bad guys are as usual the prison boss, The Warder and his Second in\u000aCommand, the Uniformed Chief Officer. There is a highly unusual twist\u000aat the end of the movie, in which the good guys win out. This is a\u000ahighly improbable situation, but fantasy is allowable in movies. One\u000acharacter of note is that of an old man, played by James Whitmore, who\u000arescues a tiny bird, and nurtures it for years. Thank goodness it\u000adoesn't get killed by some other evil person, as usually happens. The\u000aold man has to cope with pressures in the outside after he is released.The overarching theme of the movie is one of hope. No matter how bad\u000athings get, there is always hope that thing will get better. It also\u000ashows that it is possible to have a friendship between black and white\u000apeople, as the older man, the main character's friend, is a black man.\u000aThe thing that this movie gave me, is that I can see how wise my\u000adaughter already was at 12 years of age, and more importantly, it gives\u000ahope and a good philosophy for the rest of my life. I'm sure that it\u000awill do the same for those of you who see this movie too.I am unsure as to whether it deserves to be rated the best movie of all\u000atime. However movies with hope and goodness as their main themes are\u000agenerally up there, take "Gone With the Wind", "Schindler's List" and\u000a"Lord of the Rings" as examples of this.\u000a

V\u000aBack in high school, I had an English class where we read the short\u000astory by Stephen King and then watched the movie. The short story is\u000awonderfully to read by itself. However, the movie manages to both\u000aperfectly capture the whole feel and atmosphere of the original story,\u000aand improve upon it. It is rare for a movie to be better than the book,\u000ayet everyone agreed it was so. In the movie, many of the characters are\u000amore developed, and the warden is made much more crooked. Much of the\u000anarration is directly from the short story, but the parts that are not\u000ablend perfectly. It is a long movie, with little action and no special\u000aeffects, yet it is always mesmerizing and beautiful, a movie about\u000ahope, with an incredible surprise ending. I still feel cheated because\u000aI read the story first and knew the ending before I ever saw the movie.\u000a

V\u000aThe Shawshank Redemption is based on a story by Stephen King, but if\u000ayou know what King usually writes about, you will be totally surprised\u000aby this film. There are no monsters or creepy crawlies at all. No,\u000ainstead we are given a story about prison life that involves our two\u000acentral characters, Andy Dufresne (Tim Robbins) and Ellis Boyd "Red"\u000aRedding (Morgan Freeman), both of whom are convicted of multiple life\u000asentences in Shawshank Prison.Andy is a banker whose life is turned upside down when he is convicted\u000aof murdering both his wife and her lover. Sentenced to 2 life prisons,\u000aAndy does his best to survive by using his skills as a banker and\u000aaccountant to move up in the prison world. He soon gains respect from\u000ahis fellow inmates, especially Red, and not long after both he and Red\u000abecome good friends. I was never sure what Red was imprisoned for, and\u000athough the story is mainly about Andy, Red's role is just as important.\u000aKudos to Morgan Freeman, who gives one of his best performances ever.The movie is well over two hours long, but I was never bored. Frank\u000aDarabont, the director and writer of the screenplay, keeps things\u000ainteresting throughout. The pacing is perfect, and the actors, all of\u000athem, kept me engaged in the story. The movie also has some twists and\u000aturns which when finally revealed are perfect and add to the film's\u000aexcitement.The dialog is one of the most important aspects of the film and one of\u000athe films strongest points. We may have never learned much about the\u000aprison guards or the warden, but we got enough of an idea about them to\u000abe satisfied because of the dialog and because of the actors who played\u000athose parts. Also dialog is vital in Andy and Red's friendship. Without\u000ait, and the great work by the two actors, the film wouldn't have been\u000aquite as strong.The only flaw I could find in the story would be in the prison terms\u000afor both men. If they are both imprisoned for multiple life sentences,\u000ahow come they never seem to age over the years? It is a small problem,\u000abut it takes away some of the reality of the movie, and so I can't\u000aquite give it the perfect rating. Other than that, this is still and\u000aincredible movie going experience.Note: I see that Shawshank Redemption is sitting pretty at #2 on IMDb's\u000atop 250. I'm not sure it deserves to be that high, but that doesn't\u000astop it from still being superior to many other films on that list.\u000a

V\u000aThe Shawshank Redemption is by far the best movie I've seen in my life.\u000aIt has it all. The acting is superb and that is not just a complement\u000aevery single actor that appears in this movie gave probably the best\u000aacting that they could give. The story is very rough and hard, being\u000alife in prison and all, and yet it's touching, you see the leading\u000acharacter, Andy, never giving up, sticking to his story even when the\u000aworld seems to turn its back on him. Inside He finds that hope is the\u000aonly thing that's gonna make him go on, wake up everyday. Very nice\u000amessage that the movie gives you. Also the way the friendships works,\u000athe commitment, the way they stick together and help each other, very\u000abeautiful, very beautiful. So great directing, great story, great\u000aacting, EXCELLENT MOVIE! Make yourselves a favor and go rent this\u000amovie, I promise it won't let you down.\u000a

V\u000aI guess not many people will ever read this, but I just feel obliged to\u000apraise this work of art. I am an aspiring Neuropsychology student and\u000aobviously an extreme positivist. Man IS A MACHINE. Yet, The Shawshank\u000aRedemption DEFINES what BEING A HUMAN is! That is the reason why it is\u000athe best film ever made. It inspires hope, meaning, aspiration...\u000awhatever you would like to call it.I wouldn't say that it inspired me to be less scientific in my view of\u000alife, it's just that it made me feel better about life. I am still very\u000amuch in the physiological pure hard scientific corner of psychology.\u000aWhat I guess I'm trying to say is that this movie MUST put things into\u000aa rather mature perspective, even to the most rebellious and\u000aunreasonable nihilist on the face of this planet.This movie is simplistic, the story isn't intricate, it is subtle and\u000avery very very easy to follow. Yet, it resides in that category of\u000amovies that include the likes of Schindler's list, Pulp Fiction and\u000aForest Gump; it actually sits on the throne there. The essence of this\u000amovie is bigger than the discovery of Special Relativity, in that it\u000agives an answer to the question that you are faced with when hearing\u000athe short line of sweet dialog: "I guess it comes down to a simple\u000achoice really: get busy liven or get busy die'n". "What is the meaning\u000aof life?"\u000a

V\u000aTop 250 material - YES #1 movie of all time - not a chance in Hell.I saw this movie when I was like 14 or 15 and thought it was the\u000agreatest film ever made. Great acting, great story, great subplots,\u000abest Stephen King adaptation ever, Morgan Freeman. The things that bother me most now are the one-dimensional characters\u000aof the warden and guards. If we could see what turned them from human\u000abeings into what they are now, that would have been helpful to the\u000aemotional atmosphere of the film. The warden was definitely one of the\u000acentral characters and I didn't quite get a sense of who he was.Still a fantastic film, but I can think of 100 better ones.\u000a

V\u000aThis is in my opinion, tied with Goodfellas for the greatest ever made.\u000aMasterfully conceived and directed by Frank Darabont, a powerfully\u000aadapted story from Stephen King's short story, amazing acting, and one\u000aof the best musical scores ever written made this movie one of the\u000ahandful of masterpieces that will never die. Along with Goodfellas\u000alosing Best Picture, choosing Forest Gump(a great movie) over the\u000aShawshank Redemption was the biggest mistake they ever made. The movie\u000athat makes many references to redemption and hope is like Jesus\u000ahimself. The film did poorly in the box office but has enjoyed one of\u000athe greatest afterlives in the history of cinema.Plot: The story is taken from Stephen King's short story "Rita Hayworth\u000aand the Shawshank Redemption" and Frank Darabont made one of the only\u000amovies better than the source material. Masterfully crafted to start\u000awith a depressing image of everything the film goes to make one of the\u000amost uplifting, happy, and powerful endings in the history of film.Acting: Narrating is Morgan Freeman who gives an Oscar-Worthy\u000aperformance as Red a lifer for murder in The Shawshank State Prison.\u000aTim Robbins likewise gives a powerful performance as the sympathetic\u000aAndy Dufresne a lifer for murder as well. Playing the cold and ruthless\u000aMr. Norton the Warden is Bob Gunton who creates one of the greatest\u000avillains I've ever seen on screen.Quality: This film is one of the greatest ever. One of the things that\u000areally made this film was probably one of the best, most uplifting and\u000apowerful musical scores I've ever heard which also deserved an Oscar.\u000aThe camera work was also fantastic opening with a sky-view of the\u000aprison.This is one of the few movies where if you don't see the genius of it I\u000awill have to question if you really seen the entire film or any of the\u000afilm. This is along with Goodfellas the greatest movies ever. There are\u000aonly a handful of masterpieces in history and this is one of them. Even\u000aless is the amount of films that will never die and will always stand\u000athe test of time. This is one of them. This is a film that you should\u000ajust buy.11/10\u000a

V\u000aWhen the musical score alone is enough to broadcast the emotion of the\u000amovie, you know its a good film. Add to that outstanding performances\u000aand one of the best screen plays ever written and I promise you wont be\u000adisappointed.Many people are surprised to learn that this film is based on a Stephen\u000aKing novel, but they should not be. The dialog between characters is\u000aoutstanding, and required a literary genius to construct. No one says\u000ato much or to little; it's just perfect. Best line: Andy: "Why do they call you Red?" Red: "I think it's cause I'm Irish"Red: "These walls are funny. First you hate 'em, then you get used to\u000a'em. Enough time passes, you get so you depend on them. That's\u000ainstitutionalized."Red: Rehabilitated? Well, Now let me see. You know, I don't have the\u000aslightest idea what that means. parole board: Well, it means that\u000ayou're ready to rejoin society. Red: I know what you think it means,\u000asonny. To me it's just a made up word. A politician's word, so young\u000afellas like yourself can wear a suit and a tie, and have a job. What do\u000ayou really want to know? Am I sorry for what I did?\u000a

V\u000aThe Shawshank Redemption was released in a very good year for movies\u000a(1994) and although it could very well be argued that, at the time, it\u000adid not get the credit it deserved-- being overshadowed by movies like\u000aPulp Fiction and Forrest Gump, it now may get more credit than it is\u000adue. Time and time again I have heard the phrase, "They don't make them\u000alike this anymore," when The Shawshank Redemption is spoke of. However,\u000ait should be noted that Shawshank was not the first movie of its kind\u000aand owes much credit to its predecessors (taking elements and ideas\u000afrom movies like Dead Man Walking, It's a Wonderful Life, etc.) Well\u000apaced and often times very moving, The Shawshank Redemption provides us\u000awith what is initially a very realistic situation: middle aged man Andy\u000aDufresne (Tim Robbins) is put on trial wrongfully (as far as we know)\u000afor murder. Found guilty, he is put in jail for a life sentence. As the\u000amovie progresses , in part from beautiful cinematography, and in part\u000afrom lightly tugging at the audiences heart strings, we are able to\u000asympathize with the inmates, and almost pity them. The concept of\u000ahaving a home and not knowing what to do when not in your comfort zone\u000ais something that the Shawshank Redemption uses to make a simple idea\u000ainto a very good full length movie. However, it is ranked #2 on IMDb's\u000atop 250 (with a rating of 9.2 it is actually higher than The Godfather,\u000athus should be ranked #1) and this, I believe at least, is an\u000aundeserving spot for The Shawshank Redemption. While it is very good,\u000ait is certainly not among the ranks of Citizen Kane, The Godfather and\u000aothers on that level. Providing us with little or no historical or\u000acultural relevance, the movie likely earns its ranking because people\u000acan identify with it, so they end up enjoying it, and end up giving it\u000aa 10 out of 10 because they enjoy it so much. Though it pains me to say\u000ait, just because a movie is highly enjoyable, it does not make it great\u000aby any means. Andy Dufresne acts as a metaphor for the rest of the\u000ahuman race, and shows, how sometimes, we are all wrongfully accused of\u000asomething or other. However, the movie pertains only to itself, not\u000ataking on anything bigger-- so it stays a very good movie rather than\u000aan excellent one.\u000a

V\u000aI am totally puzzled as to why this film is so highly rated. It is\u000areasonably well made, has a very good cast, and it held my interest.\u000aHowever, it has nothing new in it. It wasn't fun. It wasn't life\u000achanging. It didn't make me want to be a better person. None of the\u000acharacters in the film were particularly appealing. The protagonist's\u000amethod for escaping from prison was obviously not new, since he flashed\u000ahis copy of "The Count of Monte Christo." There was an unusual\u000adirectness in confronting gay rape in prison, but I find it to be not\u000athat compelling a subject. I guess that leaves redemption. To me, he\u000apaid way too high a price for thinking about, but not actually, killing\u000ahis wife. After she cheated on him. Perhaps the point was that he felt\u000aso guilty about her death, he wanted to be punished. By spending twenty\u000ayears getting raped in prison? That's not punishment, it's just sick.\u000a

V\u000aThis film really got me. As soon as Morgan Freeman got into the movie,\u000aI started to get interested and the film ended up to be a crowd cheer\u000aand a tearjerker. The story is so well done. This movie is based on\u000aStephen Kings short novel "Rita Hayworth and Shawshank Redemption."Vice president of the Portland bank Andy Dufrane (Tim Robbins) goes to\u000ajail for two life sentences he did not commit. When he goes to jail,\u000athe first step onto the prison ground will change his life. When he's\u000abeen beaten around by the queer bull Diamond brothers, he decides to\u000await a few years to escape. Before these years he decides to meet the\u000ainstitutionalized prisoner Red (Morgan Freeman) who can get Andy or\u000aother prisoners whatever they wanted. He can get you packs of\u000acigarettes, jack hammers, naked lady cards, and posters of Rita\u000aHayworth, Marilyn Monroe etc. Andy wanted a jack hammer to crack his\u000awall. Red promised Andy that if the guards find his hammer, they will\u000anever do business again. Andy never got caught and Red and him both\u000abecame friends for a long time. Andy became a big hit for the prisoners\u000aand the guards when he helped them with their tax problems. In exchange\u000ahe got the prisoners beers. After he got the prison library to expand.\u000aThat is most of what I can say about 'The Shawshank Redemption.'Why did this film not win any academy awards? I felt this film was a\u000alot better than the brutally charged 'Pulp Fiction' than Tom Hanks life\u000aachievements as 'Forrest Gump.' This picture sees life more beautifully\u000aand more possible. This is a great luminous character study of\u000afortitude and friendship behind bars at its finest.\u000a

V\u000aI was very impressed by this movie. At first I wasn't sure if I should\u000arent it or not but I gave it a try and it is the best movie I've ever\u000aseen. The acting is very good, the plot very good, and just the right\u000aamount of drama, comedy, and sadness is included. The movie doesn't\u000aleave you wanting more like some OK movies, It finishes just how it\u000ashould. After seeing this I guarantee you'll think the money was worth\u000ait. I would would definitely give this a 10 out of 10 hands down and\u000ajudging by its excellent rating on this site, others share the same\u000aopinion. I personally wish I could see it again for the first time as\u000ait is just great! Enjoy!\u000a

V\u000aI have to say that Shawshank is THE best film i have ever seen, it was\u000arecommended to me by a friend and i have been recommending it to all\u000aand sundry ever since. You simply haven't lived until you have seen\u000athis movie and although i loved every character in this movie, Morgan\u000afreeman definitely did it for me. It leaves you realising that after a\u000along time in prison, it must be extremely intimidating to be set free\u000ain what is a crazy world and leaving a hard but familiar life behind. I\u000ahave never been to prison and never want to but its quite an insight\u000aI'm sure to how you develop a routine and a life in there. If you only\u000aever want to see one movie in your time then make this the one, if i\u000awas doing desert island discs, then this would be the movie i take with\u000ame without a doubt. And as for which movie actor i would take with me,\u000awell thats easy.....that has to be Morgan Freeman (Red) Cheers Sarah\u000a

V\u000a***SPOILERS***This is a great movie that shows us that hope is a great thing. The\u000astory tells us about Andy Dufrense, a man who is falsely accused for\u000akilling his wife and her lover and who gets sent to Maines strongest\u000aprison. Shawshank. In Shawshank Andy gets new friends, as well as\u000aenemies. Being the wise man that he is, he begins to inject wisdom in\u000apeople. Helping them. He also meets Ellis Boyd "Red" Redding. A man\u000aalso accused for murder, but on true accusations. They become great\u000afriends and together they give themselves hope. This is a wonderful movie that leaves you happy and shaken. Its an must\u000asee.\u000a

V\u000aWords can't explain how good Shawshank is. This is the only movie where\u000ai have felt emotionally attached to the characters. Frank Darabont\u000aneeds to get some work. He did an amazing job directing Shawshank.\u000aAlong with Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman perfectly cast as the main\u000acharacters, this movie just gets everything right. IT'S PERFECT. NO\u000aOTHER MOVIE WILL EVER SURPASS THE GREATNESS OF "THE SHAWSHANK\u000aREDEMPTION". (I know i can get a little dramatic). I don't understand\u000awhy it's behind the Godfather. Don't get me wrong; the Godfather is a\u000agreat film, but it doesn't compare to Shawshank. I was really surprised\u000awhen I found out that Shawshank was a box office failure. I guess\u000apeople would rather fork over their 8.50 to see garbage. I get annoyed\u000awhen people say Shawshank is a cult classic. It's not a cult classic.\u000aEven though it failed at the box office, it's appreciated by many\u000atoday, and stands on many peoples list as the greatest film of all\u000atime. It would be a crime to miss "The Shawshank Redemption". Instead\u000aof wasting your money to see garbage like "White Chicks" or whatever,\u000ayou should go and pick up a copy of Shawshank. I guarantee that you\u000awill not regret it. To me, "The Shawshank Redemption" is the greatest\u000acinematic experience of all time. Not because of flashy special\u000aeffects, but great story-telling, acting, writing, directing. This film\u000agets everything right. To sum it up in one word, this film is a\u000aMASTERPIECE.\u000a

V\u000aI'm an action movie buff and watching a drama... ohh! that's way out of\u000amy league. I avoided watching this movie for years; one, it was a drama\u000aand two, the movie title was so weird, I almost took it for some\u000adocumentary preaching about salvation. And then there was this one day\u000awhen I didn't have anything else to watch but this movie.... and the\u000arest I'll say is history. The movie just moved me. The narration by\u000aMorgan Freeman was so powerful that his voice still rings bell in my\u000ahead. Tim Robbins acted great, but so did everyone else in the movie.\u000aThe way the director has shown the events in various persons life are\u000ajust too great; special mention for the characters of Andy Dufresne,\u000aRed and Brooks Hatlen (the librarian).To sum it all, this is the best movie I have watched, way better than\u000aany of the action movies I have spent my life watching.- "Viks was here."\u000a

V\u000aThe Shawshank Redemption. Somehow for Americans it was a difficult name\u000afor a movie to get used to. From the first time I saw it, I have never\u000aforgotten it. A story of hope, friendship, perseverance. Shawshank\u000aimmediately struck a chord deep within me. I think many people that\u000ahave seen it and rate it very highly, will share this feeling. I have\u000aalways been a big movie-fan and to the question "which is the best\u000amovie ever", I could never give an answer without summing up some 3-4\u000adifferent ones. But over the years my answer has become formed and now\u000awhenever I get asked that question I can honestly say "The Shawshank\u000aRedemption".\u000a

V\u000aI don't know how many times I've seen this film, and it still is as\u000aentertaining as it's ever been. The directing is excellent. Tim Robbins\u000aand Morgan Freeman are the best choices for their respective rolls, and\u000athe story makes you wonder why Steven King ever wrote a horror novel to\u000abegin with. Even the trailer to this movie is probably one of the best\u000aI've ever seen.This is one of those movies that I've unwittingly been recruited as a\u000asalesperson for. In other words, I feel I need to show this movie to\u000aall my friends and family who haven't seen it, and I'm more than\u000awilling to watch it again. If you love this movie as much as I do, then\u000adon't forget to watch the younger brother of this film, The Green Mile.\u000aWritten and directed by the same crew. It's a great film, but has a lot\u000ato live up to.\u000a

V\u000aI read this novella in Stephen Kings "Four Seasons" while i was doing\u000amy GCSE exams. i remember then what a profound effect the story had on\u000ame. A story of hope through extreme adversity and the power of\u000afriendship that i thought could not be found between two men. The sheer\u000aanticipation of this film being released was almost heart stopping, but\u000acoupled with the fear it would not live up to my expectations. i also\u000aremember thinking that i did not want to see it for fear of it\u000ashattering my own perceptions of the two main characters, ANDY and RED.\u000ai need not have feared a thing.....the screenplay and adaptation was\u000adone with nothing short of pure brilliance. the camera work and choice\u000aof location could not have been more suitable. perhaps it is a symbol\u000aof how well Mr King writes that, it seems, everyones picture of\u000aeverything is the same!!! Thus is was quite easy to choose sets,\u000alocations and of course actors. In the book, RED is a white, Irish\u000aman......against all odds, i cannot imagine ANYONE else delivering such\u000aa captivating, believable and utterly brilliant performance as Morgan\u000aFreeman. This man deserves 20 Oscars his acting together with the small\u000astabs of narration are mind blowing who else could have done this?!!\u000aNO-ONE!! Tim Robbins IS ANDY!....his whole movement and attitude were\u000aexactly what King had written, this was encompassed in Robbins'\u000aportrayal perfectly. together the chemistry they had was beautiful, you\u000acould see that these characters were good friends, as well as the\u000aactors that played them. The visionary pieces of the film that will\u000aalways linger? well the whole film lingers, such was the effect it had\u000aon me, but the two specific points in the film? Firstly, Andy described\u000ato RED where he could find a box, near a tree in a field, under some\u000arocks to be exact. Now this bit is in the book (obviously!!) but i\u000aremember when i read it, the picture of that tree, in that field, next\u000ato that wall. In the film it was as if they had asked ME to choose the\u000alocation, a chill went down my spine and it nearly brought me to\u000atears!!! and i am NOT KIDDING!!!!. The second bit, well its right at\u000athe end, its the smile on RED's face when he sees ANDY again. This is\u000anot a feeble lip turning grin.....NO this is a full , both sets of\u000ateeth, cheek aching smile!!!! it IS the biggest and most emotional\u000asmile i have ever seen in any film. i could go on for pages about this\u000afilm, i have been a film fan ever since i can remember, sitting with my\u000afather on a Sunday afternoon (before the times of VCR's or satellite,\u000awhen you watched what was on that day or tough!!!) we watched films\u000alike "The African Queen", "Bridge on the River Kwai", "Citizen Kane",\u000a"The Rear Window", etc and from then i always liked a good film with a\u000agood story, The Shawshank Redemption was already a good story, it took\u000agenius to make it a GREAT film. to date i have seen it over 100 times.\u000athis has taken me through 3 copies on Video before the DVD came out, i\u000aam now on my 2nd DVD. if i have to buy another 100 DVD's it will always\u000aalways alway be my number one favourite film of all time. It is a film\u000ayou can watch at any time, when you are in any mood and it is still as\u000acompelling as the first time i saw it, or indeed the first time i read\u000athe story. 20 out of 10........\u000a

V\u000aDirector Frank Darabont's attention to detail and respect of each\u000asingle sub-plot is crucial to the way in which the story is unravelled.\u000aThrough a series of not quite complete shots and narration by Ellis\u000aBoyd 'Red' Redding (Morgan Freeman) a compassionate, compelling tale of\u000awoe is retold and lifted from the pages where it was first written down\u000aby Stephen King. At the beginning of the film Darabont illustrates the trapped feeling\u000aof the new prisoners particularly well in a upwards vertical shot of\u000astone walls encrusted with windows, cast in an eerie blue light as they\u000aappear to be closing in on the prisoner who happens to be passing\u000athrough the doorway. There seems to be no escape now. A feeling of indifference upon Andy's part is created at the beginning\u000aalso, using shots of many prisoners through a wire mesh fence, taunting\u000aand jeering at Andy, combined with wide shots to represent Andy's calm\u000aoverview are shown, the fact that they are shot through the fence\u000arepresenting that Andy does not belong there. However a later shot, in\u000awhich a close up on Andy zooms out to show hundreds of other prisoners,\u000aillustrates the fact that Andy has blended in and is now just another\u000acrook at Shawshank. However there remains to be something special about this crook, as is\u000aillustrated during many shots, an example of which is when Andy is\u000astanding in the dark foreground, with a group of convicts in the\u000abackground, it shows that he is separate, in his own world, a world of\u000aimagination, freedom. justice and hope. The feelings of freedom and\u000ahope are particularly well shown, using symbolism, music and voice over\u000anarration\u000a

V\u000aI've been meaning to see this movie for several years now, having heard\u000aall the hype and comments rating this as one of the best films of all\u000atime. It certainly wasn't disappointing- despite the relatively slow\u000apace compared to most brainless blockbusters of today and tendency\u000atowards sentimentality that crept up from time to time. It certainly\u000awasn't one of the greatest of all films, in my opinion, either; simply\u000aan intriguing story, with something to teach us, perhaps, very well\u000atold and very well acted. It's probably a movie I'd watch again, though\u000anot straight away, as it is quite slow paced, and, just towards the\u000aend, I felt it was getting a little too drawn out. But it's very good\u000ato look at, there are some great performances, a nice musical score\u000afrom Thomas Newman, and a great plot, with a wonderful twist at the\u000aend. So, overall this is a very good movie and one I would recommend.8/10\u000a

V\u000aThe Shawshank Redemption is without a doubt one of the most brilliant\u000amovies I have ever seen. I was moved for long time and realized that I\u000ahardly lost my hope as the prisoner. I almost have no hope, just play\u000aand give in the life, as Red. I admired to Andy. Why? When Red lost\u000acigarettes for him. You will start to get the answer. Andy was clam and\u000aclever. He was suffered from any unfair things. Although he did not\u000aspeak to others at beginning, but walk here and there, and play stone.\u000aIt was seen that he had no interesting in life in everyones' mind. In\u000afact, he always plan to escaping from the beginning. And if you noticed\u000ahe was a banker and interested in geography. You may understand why he\u000abought the hammer and work hard for the governor of prison. Grub a\u000asubway to escape the prison. As Red said, it take about 600 years to\u000atake a subway with hummer. It is impossible. Why the other can not\u000aimage but Andy done. Because he was the only person who have hope in\u000aheart and to got the life what he want. Hope is good thing, may be the\u000abest of things, and no good thing ever dies. But to others prisoner\u000ahope is danger. It means die for them. Life is what? Get busy living or\u000aget busy dying. The hopeless persons just wait for dying. But Andy was\u000aget busy living. At last, he was successful. Even make the governor of\u000aprison be punished.\u000a

V\u000a\u000aI was inspired to see Shawshank Redemption because of its ranking as second\u000abest movie of all time on this site, and a lot of people told me it was a\u000abrilliant film.I have to say I was a bit baffled after viewing this movie.It\u000ais certainly a good, entertaining, well-cast and acted film, but it is not\u000aanything special. I have seen quite a few prison drama movies like it. The\u000abrilliant performances and well paced story do set it apart from other\u000asimilar works but still this does not explain how on earth Shawshank\u000aRedemption can be classified as one of the all time best cinematic\u000aachievements.So I just want to caution anyone who thinks they will see something\u000aincredibly unique and magnificent. Without a doubt this art piece is very\u000atouching, however I found myself having forgotten about it a couple of hours\u000aafter I had seen it. Not a sign of a masterpiece...See the godfather, casablanca, american beauty, donnie darko, memento,\u000amoulin rouge for a truly breathtaking experience.See Shawshank Redemption if you want to see a quality film.Definitely not a\u000awaste of a couple of hours!\u000a

V\u000a\u000aFew movies can grab the soul like this one. \u000aFor me, every time I watch The Shawshank \u000aRedemption, I remember the music. I remember \u000athe framing, how each scene is perfectly \u000aconstructed and put together, displaying the \u000alives of the criminals. Every oily moment with \u000athe warden, every frightening vision with the \u000a`Sisters,' and of course, every point of \u000apontification by the venerable Andy Dufresne. \u000aWhile I do not consider this the greatest \u000amovie ever, it is awfully close o the top. The performances by the likes of Tim Robbins, \u000aMorgan Freeman, Clancy Brown (who was \u000adoing Dr. Pepper commercials at the time) \u000aand Bob Gunton as Warden Norton were all \u000aexceptional. One thing that always keeps \u000ame coming back is the score by Thomas \u000aNewman. While he has based his entire \u000astyle off this memorable score (listen to \u000aThe Road to Perdition and Shawshank \u000aback to back, and you'll see), the subtle \u000amovements and piano keys turn this into \u000aone of the best films of all time.\u000a

V\u000a\u000aThe Shawshank Redemption is different from any other movie in one most\u000aobvious way...there is nothing wrong with it.  Tim Robbins is fantastic as\u000athe reserved and to some extent mysterious Andy Dufresne, and Morgan\u000aFreeman's portrayal of 'Red' is just as good.  Stephen King shows he is\u000amore\u000athan a horror guru by teaming up with Frank Darabont to produce one of the\u000agreatest movies of all time.  There's humour, there's sadness, there's\u000aaction, there's drama.  This film has it all.  10/10.  Shawshank is a\u000afabulous tale and it is a shame that it won none of the Academy Awards it\u000awas nominated for.  If you haven't experienced The Shawshank Redemption,\u000astop what you doing, leave your house/office and go and either rent or buy\u000athis video.  An absolute classic.  The best.\u000aDarabont's work has been limited since this film but his last directing\u000asensation was The Green Mile.  Starring Tom Hanks, this too is a fabulous\u000afilm and both feature in my Top 5 of all time.  Watch them\u000aboth.\u000a

V\u000a\u000aI'm way too astonished to find THE SHAWSHANK REDEMPTION at the top of the\u000arankings list. Maybe it's because TITANIC got your tongues!This is a very satisfying tale about prison life that develops friendships\u000aand painful moments, with solid performances by Morgan Freeman and Tim\u000aRobbins. It's disturbing to mention a couple of major flaws I've noticed in\u000aspending 2-1/2 hours of silver screen magic. Lengthy time is just one of\u000athem. Another is that certain scenes quickly lose your interest, while\u000aothers are so interesting that you can't help but sit back and enjoy them\u000awith the pleasure of comfort. Just draw a line graph inside your head and\u000anotice how the levels get screwed as time progresses. Same thing with those\u000amachines that measure waves of earthquake intensities. I'm not being too\u000acomplex, but I think this is a good comparison to what the movie\u000aaccomplished in general. So much for the harsh part...With good intentions, THE SHAWSHANK REDEMPTION gets better and better at the\u000aconclusion, which is by far the most impressive I've witnessed. We must\u000athink of this film, as a whole, a true part of escaping society's problems,\u000athe definite basis of what it really means. Freeman's narration contributes\u000ato the story with thought, and Robbins does exceptionally well as a con who\u000aawaits the splendor of freedom. Stephen King did an adequate enough job in\u000awriting a book that escapes horror. Prison flicks usually are\u000astraightforward, but there is higher emphasis on its ideal writing, a\u000acrucially vital element in good filmmaking standards.So while THE SHAWSHANK REDEMPTION has some pros and cons, it is a natural\u000aand redeeming look at the pains and friendships that any living soul can\u000aaccept or caress. It isn't THE greatest movie ever filmed, but stands out as\u000aa Hollywood classic that will see future years for the whole world to\u000acrave.Then again, I did not say TITANIC "is" the greatest... \u000a

V\u000a\u000aThe Shawshank Redemption is a wonderful film.  It is flawless fundamentally\u000abecause of its deep love of storytelling, and because underneath each layer\u000aof the film lies a whole world of meaning.  It has universal appeal and can\u000ateach everyone something about the power of hope and the inviolability of\u000athe human spirit.I love this truly inspiring film because of its boldness to persuade people\u000ato never give up hope, even in the direst of circumstances.  Its audacity\u000acan be seen in its choice of setting: in a prison, where hope is fragile and\u000acan easily become a casualty.  But this situation is readily adaptable to\u000aany other.  People, habitually, are trapped.  Trapped by relationships,\u000afear, responsibilities and their own inadequacies.  The prison metaphor just\u000aserves to give shape and direction to this feeling of entrapment.We identify with Red (Morgan Freeman), because Andy (Tim Robbins), for quite\u000aa substantial amount of the film, remains an enigmatic and aloof character.\u000aBut we know that Andy's state of mind and hope is such that it has the\u000apotential to transcend prison walls.  Metaphorically.  Literally.  This is\u000aexplored in the scene where Andy, after spending a fortnight in solitary\u000aconfinement for sending operatic music resounding through the prison, says\u000athe time was easy because he had the music in his head and heart.  He notes:\u000a`here's where it makes the most sense.  You need it so you don't forget\u000athere's something inside that they can't get to, they can't touch, it's\u000ayours  hope'.  Indeed his mental well being is akin to an ideal state, and\u000aas such the average audience cannot identify with him.  At this stage\u000aneither can Red.  When Andy gives him the harmonica, a symbol of hope, Red\u000ais still not ready to accept it as a means to salvation. However, in the\u000abook Red acknowledges that `Andy was the part of me they could never lock\u000aup, the part of me that will rejoice when the gates finally open for me and\u000aI walk out.'But Andy is after all only human, and the trials he undergoes makes us\u000adeeply sympathetic to his situation.  The possibilities that had previously\u000agiven him hope rapidly erode as the harsh realities of prison life bear down\u000aon him.  Before he had noted facetiously that a `convicted murderer who\u000aprovides sound financial planning' was a `wonderful pet to have', but now\u000arealizes that the warden and the guards simply and fundamentally, don't care\u000awhether he lives or dies, as long as it's on their terms.  He acknowledges\u000ahis only choice left, deceptively elementary but truly universal in scope:\u000a`Get busy living or get busy dying'.This choice is evinced through the character of Brooks.  When his parole\u000acomes through he sadly frees his bird Jake who flies away, instinct taking\u000aover his initial domestication.  Brooks is also in a sense a bird, but of a\u000adifferent feather  a `jail bird', who is `institutionalised', or\u000adomesticated and thus cannot cope with the immensity and the possibilities\u000aof mental and spiritual freedom.  Walls bind his world, and as such, he\u000acannot bear to live in a world without boundaries.  As depicted in this\u000afilm, prison restrains physical freedom, but ironically enough, its lasting\u000aeffects restrain the spirit.  As Red bitterly notes: `They send you here for\u000alife, and that's exactly what they take.  The parts that count\u000aanyway.'A wonderful shot of Red near the end sees him narrate that on the outside he\u000afeels as scared as Brooks did, and frequently entertains the idea of\u000abreaking his parole so he can return to prison, `where things make sense'.\u000aThe fact that he repeats a lot of Brooks' dialogue shows how close Red came\u000ato succumbing, and the strength of Andy's friendship with him.  The camera\u000asweeps over a selection of guns, but an array of compasses step into view.\u000aRed fingers one and remembers the promise he made to Andy.  This signifies\u000aan immutable truth: that hope and direction combined can see a man achieve\u000agrandeur.The audience's collective spirit soars with Red who takes Andy's advice, and\u000alets the possibilities of freedom penetrate his self, which is his ultimate\u000aredemption.  An element of the film surpasses the novella  that of the\u000aphrase Warden Norton utters to Andy: `Salvation lies within.'   This is\u000ashown to be wholly accurate on both a metaphorical and literal\u000alevel.The film judiciously avoids trying to make the audience sympathise with the\u000aother prisoners who are collectively rapists, murderers and deviants.  As\u000asuch, their reason for imprisonment is either humorously blamed on\u000aincompetent lawyers or not touched upon at all.  This prevents the\u000asympathetic focus straying from Andy and Red; Andy who is innocent and Red\u000awho describes himself as the `only guilty man in Shawshank'.Morgan Freeman is characteristically excellent as he has the ability to\u000aeffortlessly inject integrity and a noble presence into each of his roles.\u000aHe should have won the Best Supporting Actor Oscar in 1995.  Tim Robbins is\u000asublime, though to a lesser degree than Freeman.  Supporting cast is\u000awonderful: James Whitmore's poignant representation of Brooks, Bob Gunton's\u000aanal-retentive Warden Norton, Gil Bellows' cocky but well-intentioned Tommy\u000aWilliams.  William Sadler and Clancy Brown are also strong.One tagline of the film descriptive of Andy is `It takes a strong man to\u000asave himself, and a great man to save another.'  In King's novella Red\u000adescribes Andy through bird imagery, repeating the motif associated with\u000aBrooks: `We're glad he's gone, but a little sad too.  Some birds are not\u000ameant to be caged, that's all.  Their feathers are too bright, their songs\u000atoo sweet and wild.  So you let them go  And the part of you that knows it\u000awas wrong to imprison them in the first place rejoices, but still, the place\u000awhere you live is that much more drab and empty for their departure.'  Not\u000aso for Red, however.  His last words  `I hope.' are testament to\u000athis. \u000a\u000a

V\u000a\u000aAs I write these, the IMDB poll has this listed as the top film of their top\u000a250 films of all time.  I'm a little surprised by this, as you can imagine.\u000aOn the one hand, it's always nice to see a list that's willing to throw a\u000acurve, instead of automatically putting CITIZEN KANE at the top, and this\u000achoice certainly qualifies.  And don't get me wrong, I think this is a very\u000agood film.  The relationship between the characters played by Tim Robbins\u000aand Morgan Freeman is well played out (and both actors are excellent), the\u000astory is well-adapted from the Stephen King novella, and Frank Darabont\u000adeserves credit for keeping it simple without making it simplistic.On the other hand, the greatest film of all time?  It didn't even make my\u000atop 10 for 1994 (they were, btw, PULP FICTION, QUIZ SHOW, HOOP DREAMS, THREE COLORS: RED, THE BOYS OF ST. VINCENT, THE LAST SEDUCTION, NOBODY'S FOOL, BURNT BY THE SUN, SIRENS, and ED WOOD).  It\u000adid indulge in a few cliches, like the caged bird kept by James Whitmore's character, and the "sisters", that prevented it from being a 5-star movie(that's my highest rating). Nevertheless, it is\u000aa very good movie, 9/10, and I'm glad to see so many people have caught up to it after it didn't do so well during its theatrical release.\u000a

V\u000ais an impressive, engrossing piece of film-making from\u000adirector/screenwriter Frank Darabont who adapted horror master Stephen\u000aKing's 1982 novella Rita Hayworth and Shawshank Redemption (first\u000apublished in Different Seasons) for his first feature film. The\u000ainspirational, life-affirming and uplifting, old-fashioned style\u000aHollywood product (resembling The Birdman of Alcatraz (1962) and Cool\u000aHand Luke (1967)) is a combination prison/dramatic film and character\u000astudy. The popular film is abetted by the golden cinematography of\u000aRoger Deakins, a touching score by Thomas Newman, and a third imposing\u000acharacter - Maine's oppressive Shawshank State Prison (actually the\u000atransformed, condemned Mansfield Ohio Correctional Institution or State\u000aReformatory).Posters for the film illustrate the liberating, redemptive power of\u000ahope and the religious themes of freedom and resurrection, with the\u000awords: "Fear can hold you prisoner, Hope can set you free." Darabont's\u000afilm is a patiently-told, allegorical tale (unfolding like a\u000along-played, sometimes painstaking, persistent chess game) of\u000afriendship, patience, hope, survival, emancipation, and ultimate\u000aredemption and salvation by the time of the film's finale.It was nominated for seven Academy Awards, including Best Picture, Best\u000aActor (Morgan Freeman), Best Adapted Screenplay, Best Cinematography,\u000aBest Editing, Best Original Score, and Best Sound - but it failed to\u000awin a single Oscar. And the film's director failed to receive a\u000anomination for himself! In the same year as Forrest Gump, Pulp Fiction,\u000aand Speed, they received all of the attention. Only through positive\u000aword-of-mouth (following cable TV and broadcast airings, and then video\u000areleases) did the film do well - although its original reception at the\u000abox-office was lukewarm. The film was the precursor for another\u000ainspirational and popular film (and a similar adaptation of a Stephen\u000aKing story by writer/director Frank Darabont) - The Green Mile (1999)\u000a

V\u000aWritten and directed by Frank Darabont in 1994, The Shawshank\u000aRedemption is a film about a banker named Andy Dufresne (Tim Robbins)\u000awho is wrongly accused of and sent to prison for the murder of his\u000acheating wife and her lover. During his stay in prison he becomes a\u000afinancial adviser to the guards and the warden. The warden is involved\u000ain taking bribes and enlists Andy to hide this illegal money. Andy\u000abefriends Red (Morgan Freeman) the guy in the joint that can get things\u000aon the inside and they become close friends throughout the movie. This\u000ais a well written story and seemed to be a good escape from everyday\u000alife, but does not qualify as one of my all time favorite movies. I\u000athought that filming most of the movie in a prison was kind of boring\u000aand the lack of action or any type of visual effects made it a little\u000adull. This is not a movie I would watch again and again. The pace is\u000ajust so slow.\u000a

V\u000aThe Shawshank Redemption is a simple story elegantly, cleverly told,\u000anot to mention expertly acted. The story is about a banker (Tim\u000aRobbins), wrongly convicted of killing his wife and her lover, who\u000afinds the strength to deal with the brutality of prison, thanks to a\u000amurderer serving a life term.The film is a tense drama of injustice and male dignity, brilliantly\u000aadapted from Stephen King's story, with Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman\u000aat their peak. A satisfying, audience-pleasing film. It has enjoyed a\u000acurious after-life. On its release in 1994, The Shawshank Redemption\u000ahad mixed reviews and grossed just $28 million in the US; it did not\u000amake the list of Top 50 films at the box-office for that year. Yet in\u000a2001, Channel 4 TV viewers voted it their third favourite film of all\u000atime, behind only the Star Wars and Godfather films. Readers of Time\u000aOut and Empire magazines also named it among their very favourites.\u000a

V\u000aOK OK OK Shawshank's a very good film. Not in MY top 25, or even top\u000a50, but it's a good film. Robbins and Freeman certainly work magic and\u000athe story is quite entertaining, if a tad predictable, especially the\u000aHollywood happy ending. However, this film is FAR from being the "#2"\u000abest movie in the IMDb top 250. In fact, Shawshank Redemption as the #\u000a2 film is the most overrated anything I've ever come across. Maybe\u000asomebody will rank Paulie Shore as the # 2 greatest actor, but until\u000athat time this one wins most overrated, hands down. I really don't\u000athink this film deserves a 3 rating, heck I might give it a 5, but if\u000athere's folks blowing this thing way out of proportion with 10's then\u000asomebody's got to slip an underrating in there just to weed out the\u000aShawshank homers....\u000a

V\u000a\u000aIs Shawshank a good film? Yes. Is it the second greatest film of all time\u000aas\u000athis website suggests? Definitely not! I continually fail to see how\u000apeople\u000arank it so high. I don't even believe it was the best film of its given\u000ayear. Pulp Fiction was a much more inventive film that changed the way\u000afilms\u000awere made afterwards. Shawshank is a good film but I doubt it changed the\u000acinematic landscape or it can be looked at as a work of an auteur. I am\u000aguessing the same people who regard it so high are the same people who\u000ahave\u000anever seen a foreign film or consider black and white films hard to\u000awatch.I hate to be so critical of a film that I enjoy. But at the same time, I\u000afeel I have to show my discontent with movie goers. I also don't consider\u000athe Lord of the Rings the 5th best film or Memento the 10th best film of\u000aall\u000atime. There were films made prior to 1990.\u000aPeople are free to have their opinions and I am allowed to have mine as\u000awell. My opinion is that the general public are the ones who encourage\u000aHollywood to put out recycled formulas year after year.***1/2 out of ****\u000a

V\u000a\u000aIt's a lovely story with nice guys (you'd love to make friends with) and bad\u000aguys (you'd love to hate). OK. Let's say it's the kind of entertaining stuff\u000athat makes you feel good... provided you are lenient enough to find it deep,\u000agenuinely humane, etc.So you think it's a wonderful movie? Welly welly well. Maybe I need to tell\u000ayou something about cinema. [Don't take it as a lesson from an infatuated\u000aFrenchman but simply as the point of view of a cinema lover.]\u000aCinema is about images made emotions. Hence astoundingly good movies are way\u000aabove the usual recipe: (good story + good story-telling) + (good characters\u000a+ good actors) = good movie.As long as it was, never did I felt emotions through images in The Shawshank\u000aRedemption. The good characters/actors/story-telling... had already killed\u000aevery single spark of emotion. Especially the deadpan voice-over\u000anarration.Bottom line: Shawshank Redemption is beautifully bundled, not beautifully\u000acrafted. Guess why Tim Robbins directed Dead Man Walking the year\u000aafter.\u000a

It was really great and I am sorry it did not win any Oscars, because\u000ait deserved to win more than "Forrest Gump", in my opinion.  Tim Robbins\u000aactually played a likable guy and Morgan Freeman was perfection.SPOILER ALERT!!!I cried when "Red" was given parole! I also should have known what was going\u000ato happen to Tommy Williams, but that caught me by surprise.I do have one problem with the movie, but I got over it right away and did\u000anot diminish from the entire experience.  If Andy's cell was on an upper\u000alevel, and in between other cells, where was this tunnel he built actually\u000asupposed to be? The ending was very cathartic, thank God.  After the brutality and injustice\u000aportrayed in the movie, we needed that. And the ending was very beautiful\u000atoo. \u000a

V\u000aAfter seeing how high it was on 'best film' lists I thought it must be\u000asomething great, unfortunately it didn't live up to my expectations.\u000aSure, it was a touching story, great actors and of course a great\u000aending, but I couldn't help feeling disappointed. Shawshank Redemption\u000awas visually boring and seemed to drag on for hours and hours without\u000areaching any type of plot until three quarters into the film, and the\u000aplot itself was pretty unrealistic, sorry but what are the chances of\u000ahim meeting a man, who knows the man who really killed his wife?\u000a...unlikely. I must admit, its not a bad film and i'd watch it again\u000ajust for the ending, which I didn't see coming at all.

V\u000aThis is supposed to be better than every movie but The Godfather? Well,\u000amaybe I could think more positively about it without such ridiculous\u000acomparisons, but this is an average movie at best. I guess my biggest\u000aproblem with it is that it is so completely far-fetched. You have a few\u000acharacters supplied solely to provide the "sad" moments, and everything\u000aelse is just built up to provide a fulfilling and completely happy\u000aending. Now I'm no prison warden, but I would look behind my tenant's\u000aposters (more in case they've tunneled into each other's rooms for a\u000alittle lights-out action).Anyway, as I thought about it more, the movie started to remind me of\u000aanother classic prison flick, Cool Hand Luke. Unfortunately for\u000aShawshank, Tim Robbins is no Paul Newman, and whatever stiff played the\u000awarden is no Struther Martin. Perhaps more importantly, though, is the\u000away in which Cool Hand Luke presents a much more believable series of\u000aevents, with no fairy tale ending. Luke's omission of the whole\u000aprison-love thing is even forgivable thanks to the inclusion of a\u000aclassic car wash scene. One does not need a prisoner who happened to be\u000aroommates with a prisoner who happened to kill the wife of a man who\u000ahappens to be a prisoner to create drama. It's a truth Shawshank dearly\u000aneeds to learn.\u000a

V\u000aLet me start by saying that I always enjoy watching this film. It is\u000aperhaps one of the ultimate Hollywood feel-good movies. However, to\u000acall a film one of the greatest of all time, you need to compare it\u000awith many films of all types, and from many sources. This film is above\u000aaverage Hollywood fayre, and does indeed look very good compared to\u000amost of the over-hyped brain-disengaged tosh Hollywood produces.I am suspicious of most film top 100's, 10's etc etc in any case. They\u000aare as much a reflection of the average age and experience of those\u000avoting than any intrinsic value of the film.Withouit wanting to be disrespectful, anyone who feels this film\u000auniquely opens their eyes to certain fundamental truths about the human\u000acondition, would do better watching Sondeburgh's highly accessible, but\u000amore profound exploration on love, loss, faith, hope and redemption\u000a"Solaris". The adventurous might also check out Tarkovsky's 1972\u000aRussian version!\u000a

How else to explain the\u000aNo. 2 ranking of a film that probably does not belong in the Top 2000?\u000aIt is an entertaining prison yarn but there are at least twenty prison\u000amovies that are superior to this and the filmmakers had the good sense\u000ato borrow from these (I Am a Fugitive from a Chain Gang, The Great\u000aEscape, Cool Hand Luke, etc.).

This is not to say that I enjoyed those scenes - I didn't -\u000abut it appeared that it was Frank Darabont's sophomoric attempt at\u000ainstilling some sense of prison reality into an otherwise boring story about\u000amale bounding.

V\u000a\u000aMostly what can been said has been said. This really isn't anywhere\u000anear he greatest movie ever made. For heaven's sake, it's a competent\u000agenre flick that runs a little too long but contains a couple of\u000awell-turned performances from the leads. Tim Robbins, incidentally, is\u000away better in Mystic River. Down by Law and Birdman of Alcatraz are both significantly more\u000ainteresting and original prison movies than this one. Cool Hand Luke is\u000aobviously the greatest prison film of all time. Shawshank is so-so.\u000aThink about it, was there a moment, a second, a single plot turn in\u000athat film you didn't know was coming? When the young guy goes out for\u000ahis little conference with the warden, did you not think 'come on, guy,\u000ahaven't you seen any movies?' Predictability is satisfying I suppose,\u000ain its way, but give me originality and genuine passion every time.\u000aShawshank has neither of those attributes.

V\u000aWatching this film made me think about the genre of "prison"-movies and\u000awhat the theme really is in these stories. All of them seem to have\u000asome common elements; the warden is a psychopath, there is almost\u000aalways some inmate that is out to get the protagonist in some way,\u000athere is the companionship and last but not least the portrayal of the\u000ahuman spirit that will not be broken in the direst of circumstances.\u000aAnd maybe that is what "shawshank" wants to tell us; that the strong\u000aindividual can beat an unfair and cruel system by different means. In\u000athis story we have Andy Dufresne who is clever but also able to endure\u000avisits in "the hole" many times without developing psychiatric\u000aphenomena. In this sense I will claim that this movie is just as much a\u000apiece of fiction as lets say "starwars" is. It is simply not possible\u000ato stay sane if you are repeatably treated in a degrading manner and if\u000ayou live in constant fear. The movie is highly entertaining but should\u000anot be seen as a serious attempt to explore human reactions in a prison\u000aenvironment where inmates are treated as garbage. Don't fool yourself\u000aon this account. Luke Skywalker is just as real as the character of\u000aAndy Dufresne is.Regards Simon\u000a

V\u000aThe Shawshank Redemption is reasonably well written, directed, acted,\u000aand filmed. Yet in my judgment it is a below-average movie. It lacks a\u000areal plot, and, while the title promises redemption, nobody and nothing\u000ais redeemed. The characters lack depth, and many events are\u000aimplausible.No doubt, wardens and prison guards can be wicked people. But those\u000aportrayed in this film are so completely perverse that they become\u000auninteresting. Their function is to represent "the establishment" and\u000a"authority." The audience is meant to identify with Andy Dufresne, the\u000amain character. While innocent of the murders of which he is convicted,\u000ahe's hardly an admirable character, and he becomes worse during his\u000aimprisonment. He's a clever manipulator who eagerly cooperates in the\u000awarden's criminal activities in the hope of profiting from doing\u000aso--which he eventually does. The prison also has has a contingent of\u000ahomosexual rapists, who are called "not human" so as to avoid admitting\u000athat their behavior is all too human, and very much in need of\u000aredemption.Thus, the film's popularity: it appeals to our tendency to rationalize\u000aour own wickedness by comparing ourselves with moral monsters.\u000aUnfortunately, serving that function does not make a mediocre film\u000agreat any more than serving sound moralism does.\u000a

When the\u000apayoff at the end finally arrived, it just wasn't grand enough to\u000aovercome the feeling i'd just crawled through the sewer.And for this to be the #1 film on IMDb (actually second, but same score\u000aas #1 and with more votes) among far superior films like "The\u000aGodfather", "Schindler's List", "Lord of the Rings", and "Casablanca",\u000ais ludicrous.

The characters are believable, with the storyline also being\u000afairly solid.My favorite scene is the tar/roof top scene. Very well done. Very real\u000alife.I'd like to get the BlueRay version of this and watch the special items\u000afor this movie. I'd like to see the making of it and the behind the\u000ascenes.The only real weak part of the movie is the ending. It almost feels\u000alike it is being pushed a little too quickly and I thought their should\u000ahave been some dialog at the end.Acting 1 Storyline 1 Continuity 0 Plot Twists 1 Realism 1 Directing 15 of 6\u000a

V\u000aI consider a technically well made movie, good story with great actors,\u000abut nothing more. Use the melodic drama injustice, but not quite\u000aspectacular, as a masterpiece of cinema. I think a great movie for\u000aafternoon session, but not the level of movies that have the best score\u000aof all time. This I consider an injustice. This film has to have\u000asomething else to be an excellent movie. I respect the majority opinion\u000ahere, but I put my sincere considerations, here is a democratic space\u000ato put our feelings and emotions. Film is a passion, and I'm sure we'll\u000abe together to honest debate with many other films. I liked this movie,\u000abut without much enthusiasm, as in the comments here. For me, a movie\u000aonly average ...\u000a

V\u000aI heard about this movie very much some use to say "this is the\u000agreatest ever movie" but after watching it I started saying "what a\u000amovie(I mean awful)?There is nothing great about this movie its a\u000aboring 2 hours crap.The story is about a guy called Andy(Tim Robbins)\u000ais convicted with crime which he has not committed.The whole movie\u000adescribes Andy life in prison and finally how he escapes from the\u000aprison which takes almost 20 years for him to escape.If anyone has a\u000avery high expectations about this film then please erase it.Its just a\u000aordinary movie there is nothing in this movie.If someone want to kill a\u000atime then watch it.I m going with 6/10 for this movie.Not so good,Not\u000aso bad.\u000a

V\u000aI don't get how this movie could be the best rated in the IMDb. Sure\u000ait's good, maybe great, but come on, there are so many movies more\u000ameaningful, more groundbreaking, more shaking... That's a clever story\u000awith an amazing end. Actually, it's probably one of the happiest movie\u000aend. Maybe that's why people like it so much. Sure there is some\u000amessage about justice, perseverance and courage, but all in all very\u000aclassic and easy, not to say shallow. So I rated it 7 as an efficient\u000aentertaining movie. Nothing really special in the photography, nor in\u000athe acting, nor in the staging, nor politically. No complexity in the\u000afeelings nor in the characters. Really, it does deserve good critics,\u000abut certainly not being ranked best movie ever. I suppose the shawshank\u000afanatics would also give the litterature nobel prize to Stephen King?\u000a

A very thoughtful outlook.\u000aAfter a while, what some on the outside "looking in" may consider\u000aoutrageously profound comes to be the only reality worth acceptance to\u000athe one stuck on the inside of it all.

V\u000aDon't miss it.The depiction of brutal injustice and hopelessness in this movie is\u000autterly convincing. I was totally taken in, and by 80% of the way\u000athrough was dreading the end: on the one hand, I knew that stagnation,\u000ainstitutionalization and hopelessness are the fates to be expected in\u000athe U. S. prison system, and would not be disappointed or surprised to\u000asee an end similar to the beginning in those regards; on the other\u000ahand, I hoped for some kind of positive uplift at the end.\u000aUnfortunately I was disappointed in both expectations. The Hollywood\u000aending was too contrived and unbelievable to maintain the high level of\u000arealism of the first part of the movie.1. You cannot tunnel through 15 feet of concrete with a rock hammer,\u000aeven in 20 years. 2. A Portland newspaper cannot banner-headline a\u000aprison corruption story, ever. 3. The Warden could have notified all\u000athe banks to expect an escapee masquerading as a customer before\u000aDufresne could have withdrawn funds from 10 banks. Have you tried to\u000aclose a bank account recently? 4. Dufresne could not have kept his suit\u000aand papers intact crawling through 500 yards of sewer pipe.Etc., etc. No ending is better than a contrived feel-good ending. Were\u000athe producers concerned that we might be too inspired to advocate\u000aprison reform unless they gave us a shot of feel-good at the end?\u000aFortunately the power and artistic perfection of the first part of the\u000amovie dominates. Very disturbing and powerful. I am grateful for the conversation it\u000ainspired between my stepdaughter, my girlfriend and myself this\u000amorning. We ranged over the Massachusetts Geoghan case, the death\u000apenalty, criminal justice in the U. s. vs. China, and the thousands of\u000amovies that do NOT have Hollywood endings.\u000a

V\u000ai don't even know what to write about this movie. while i was leaving\u000athe theatre, i already knew it became my favorite movie. its degrading\u000ato this film to even call it a movie, its a masterpiece. a one of a\u000akind portrait which can't be duplicated. every scene is perfectly\u000acrafted; perfectly filmed. the pace is perfect; there is never a dull,\u000aor too fast moment during the film. the music is beyond words, how the\u000adirector was able to incorporate such feeling with the music he used is\u000abeyond my comprehensibility. the acting is phenomenal (obviously, how\u000acan Morgan freeman be bad in anything?), Tim Robbins ain't to shabby\u000aeither. the writing is the true work of art, though. the script is\u000acompletely magnificent; its a gem.still to this day its by far my favorite movie, and let me tell you\u000aI've probably seen more movies than you've even heard of. its unique\u000aand thats the only thing that one movie has to stand out from all the\u000aother movies created in this business. and let me tell you, oh how this\u000amovie stands out.\u000a

V\u000aNow this is why we go to movies. I'm surprised at how this film flopped\u000awhen it was first released in 1994 and yet 11 years later, it's\u000aconsidered one of the greatest movies of all time. I think it's the\u000agreatest movie of all time (sorry, to all of those who think that title\u000agoes to "The Godfather"). Yet, here is a movie that in all instances\u000ashould have failed. Maybe it was because of the plot, which shared too\u000amany likenesses to every cliché prison drama we've ever seen. But I\u000aassure you, that's not what goes on here. Directed by Frank Darabont,\u000awho wrote the film's script, which is an adaptation of the Stephen King\u000ashort story "Rita Hayworth and the Shawshank Redemption," "The\u000aShawshank Redemption" is filled with a strong sense of self-worth and\u000apurpose. Yes, in the beginning a man named Andy Dufresne (Tim Robbins)\u000ais convicted for a murder he did not commit. Behind the walls of\u000aShawshank penitentiary, Andy finds himself the victim (a "fish" -\u000aprison slang for a new arrival) of violent acts by other hardcore\u000aconvicts. He begins a tentative friendship with a fellow lifer, Red\u000a(Morgan Freeman, in an Oscar-nominated role), and Andy finds himself\u000adoing the taxes of the warden (Bob Gunton). In all of this, we know\u000athat a man, like Andy, is not meant to be locked up, whether he\u000acommitted a heinous crime or not because simply, the human spirit is\u000anot meant to kept down by mortal circumstances. This lends a great\u000aamount of weight and structure to the film's most powerful image, which\u000ahas ingrained itself indelibly into our minds. This movie carefully\u000aavoids clichés, and it's the better for it. Tim Robbins is a revelation\u000ain this movie, as is Morgan Freeman and the rest of the supporting\u000aplayers. "The Shawshank Redemption" is a film about hope in even the\u000amost bleak of places, which could be considered prison. It's a movie\u000athat has rightfully earned a place in cinematic history as a legend and\u000aa masterpiece of film. It's no wonder why.10/10\u000a

V\u000aA friend of mine once asked "why is The Shawshank Redemption so good?".So let me tell you.Visually I find the movie excellent. Now I can't say I am an expert in\u000amovies, but in my opinion the acting is very good. The parts for Andy\u000aand Red aren't extremely difficult or anything, but they are carried\u000aout truly well. Also the supporting actors were good, though I don't\u000athink they match the leading actors' performances.Some shots in the movie are awesome. Just tiny little details and\u000aangles make them special. I could pull out many examples, but you\u000ashould watch the movie yourself and see those little things that I\u000abelieve make it excellent.Now what I have mentioned above, won't make the movie one of the best\u000aever. But then there's the story. Oh yes the story. Written by Stephen\u000aKing, it's basically very simple at the start and gets more complex and\u000aspreads out like a cobweb. In the middle, we have interesting twists\u000aand then near the end, the ultimate climax. Now another thing I found\u000ainteresting about the plot, was that the actual "high-point" of the\u000amovie was not as near to the end as usual. The movie kind of lets you\u000acool down before the very end. I found that great.That was The Shawshank Redemption technically, now people find like a\u000anew dimension in it emotionally. It's a movie about hope and\u000afriendship. It touches almost everyone who watches it. It evokes strong\u000afeelings. It's what makes it the best movie ever.\u000a

V\u000aMany of the most powerful stories are the soulful ones that teach us\u000anot to despair, not to be swamped by sorrow. They remind us that ¡°\u000ahope¡± is a precious and buoyant emotion that can give our lives\u000asubstance and meaning.Most people who see this movie for the first time are not going to\u000aappreciate it completely, I feel that it is quite possible the best\u000amovie ever made. Some may be more entertaining, like say Indian Jones\u000aand the last Crusade, but none as compelling. The movie shows a world\u000aof different emotions, mainly through its two main characters, Red and\u000aAndy. The acting is incredible. The message is stronger than that of\u000amost any movie, and is stated very clearly. ¡° Hope¡± is a good thing,\u000amaybe the best of things, and no good thing ever does.¡± After being\u000adrained by the sad events that occur in the movie, the ending uplifts,\u000aand thoroughly fulfills the gap that it could leave you with.I believe that one reason that this movie is under appreciated is that\u000apeople have not seen it multiple times. At first viewing it is the\u000astory of Andy and his struggle to maintain hope despite his\u000acircumstances. However, this is really a movie about Red and his\u000astruggle to find meaning and purpose. The final segment of the movie\u000atestifies to the fact that the final resolution of the story comes\u000aabout only when Red is faced with the same fearful situation as Brooks.\u000aBecause of Andy, Red can find different path of freedom that is lit by\u000ahope.No matter what circumstances you live in, do not forget that hope is\u000athe best thing in the world. And you will have courage to struggle, to\u000aforward, and to live better in the world.\u000a

V\u000a\u000aI figured prison life to be much harsher, as seen in other films.  This is\u000athe films only weak point, but then the story would suffer if the film was\u000alike Fight club.  This is a story about a man who loses everything but still\u000asurvives.  He uses his intelligence to outwit his attackers, and function in\u000aprison.  No matter what happens he still kept his dreams alive.  What is a\u000aman without dreams?  The word institutionalized is used in this film to\u000adescribe what the prison does to the individual. Tim Robbins will not have\u000athe inner freedom of who he is change to what the prison dictates.  There\u000aare many interesting subplots that keeps the viewer's attention.  These\u000asubplots culminate into a unforgettable conclusion.\u000a

V\u000a\u000aEvery single scene in The Shawshank Redemption, every bit of dialogue,\u000aeverything that happens all beautifully serves the purpose of intensifying\u000athe impact of the story itself. The muted colors and the relaxed\u000acinematography do a spectacular job of taking us back in time, and the\u000amessage of the film is inspiring, to say the least. What you have in the Shawshank Redemption is a film that is extremely well\u000athought-out and put together in such a way that it is able to hold your\u000aattention even for well over two hours. The movie is about holding on to\u000ahope in even the worst circumstances, even under tremendous stress, and even\u000awhen you are in that situation unjustly. However, even though Andy Dufresne\u000ais clearly the protagonist, Red is actually a more important person as far\u000aas the message of the film. He seems to embody the lessons learned in the\u000afilm, and this is shown in the way that his life is transformed by his\u000afriendship with Andy.However, there were a few things about this film that I didn't like that I\u000athink took a lot away from it. For example, even though I admit that it\u000adidn't reduce the potency of the film itself, everything worked out a little\u000atoo perfectly for Andy in prison. Sure, he got beaten up and sexually\u000aassaulted, but look at the aftermath of those attacks. When the "Sisters"\u000abeat him within an inch of his life, did he get his nose broken? Was he left\u000awith any scars? Were any of his limbs casted? Did he even develop a limp?\u000aNo, what happened was he spent a month in the infirmary and got out with his\u000ahair messed up. That's a pretty small price to pay for almost being beaten\u000ato death. I also find it hard to believe that every single guard in the prison,\u000aincluding the warden, would allow a prisoner to do their taxes. Sure, he's\u000agot expertise in the banking field, but he's also been convicted of murder.\u000aI would think that the warden in particular, with all of his, ahem,\u000aactivities, would want to kind of keep to himself as far as his finances.\u000aAnother problem was the timeline. We see events that take place over long\u000aperiods of time, but we are largely left to speculate about what goes on in\u000athe years that are skipped over. The film comes together as a great story,\u000abut you have to keep in mind that in between scenes that seem to run\u000atogether, YEARS have gone by. The aging process wasn't done very well\u000aeither. All of the characters involved looked almost exactly the same at the\u000abeginning of the movie as they did at the end. When that many years have\u000apassed, something needs to be done to try to make the actors look at least a\u000alittle bit older.Aside from these minor deficiencies, as well as a confusing title, The\u000aShawshank Redemption is an absolutely incredible film. The setbacks can be\u000aoverlooked because of the fact that the film as a whole communicates such an\u000aimportant and powerful message, and the film is not boring even for a\u000asecond. It's intense, it's beautifully made, and it will not soon be\u000aforgotten.\u000a

V\u000aI'm utterly mystified at the cult of idolatry that has developed around\u000athis solid but not overly memorable prison film based on a Stephen King\u000ashort story."The Shawshank Redemption" came out of nowhere in 1994 to be nominated\u000afor 7 Academy Awards, and I have to believe that it's the film's\u000aunderdog story that has helped it to develop such a following over the\u000ayears as much as it is the quality of the film itself. There's nothing\u000aegregiously wrong with it, but it's overly-sentimental and obvious\u000afilm-making from a director who has done nothing but make too serious\u000afilm adaptations of Stephen King novels. I think it's become apparent over the years that Morgan Freeman is a\u000aone-trick pony when it comes to acting, but at the time he wasn't quite\u000aas well known, so the wise sage role he plays here seemed good enough\u000ato get him an Oscar nomination. However, it's Tim Robbins who really\u000adeserves the most praise as the man wrongly imprisoned. The less said\u000aabout the actors who play the various prison personnel, the better --\u000athey're all played as horrorshow goons.The original Stephen King story was an entertaining bit of pulp, but\u000aFrank Darabont tries to turn it into something that the story just\u000aisn't -- namely, an epic story about one man's struggle to free his\u000asoul. As a result, where the story felt sleek and satisfying, the film\u000afeels sanctimonious and bloated.Grade: B\u000a

But to think that people\u000aconsider this better than... just for a few examples... all the\u000awonderful Hitchcock, Kurosawa, Fellini, Bergman, Leone and Welles films\u000ais shocking. The fact that "The Dark Knight" is higher on this list\u000athan "The Shawshank Redemption" is equally shocking. "The Shawshank\u000aRedemption" is ranked higher than "The Godfather," for Christ's sake!!!\u000aOf course, this is a list based on popular taste... not "high culture."\u000aI have plenty of problems with high culture, myself. But I have even\u000amore problems calling this one of the greatest films ever made. Frank\u000aDarabont isn't even a GOOD director. He's turned out three solid\u000afilms... and then a bunch of crap. His "solid films" are pretty\u000ahamfisted and corny. But then people continue to like crap like "Gone\u000awith the Wind" to this very day.It's amazing to think people like this film better than... say... "Taxi\u000aDriver." It tells you something. Anyway, I could go on and on like\u000athis. If you enjoyed "The Shawshank Redemption," it would be\u000ahypocritical for me to fault you that. After all, I liked it, too.I don't mean this comment to be helpful to those considering watching\u000athe film. I mean it to be thought-provoking for those who appreciate\u000athe history of great cinema.\u000a

V\u000aSTAR RATING:*****Unmissable****Very Good***Okay**You Could Go Out For A\u000aMeal Instead*Avoid At All CostsIn 1947,banking boss Andy Dufresne (Tim Robbins) is convicted of the\u000amurder of his wife and her lover and given two life sentences in the\u000anotorious Shawshank State Prison.Keeping himself to himself and giving\u000aoff a slightly aloof vibe,Andy finds it hard to settle in at first,but\u000athen he develops a friendship with prison fixer Red (Morgan Freeman)\u000awhich comes to stand the test of time between life within the confines\u000aof Shawshank...and even outside it.Stephen King adaptations are things that generally seem to have trouble\u000aeven becoming watchable things on the big screen,let alone\u000aspell-bindingly brilliant pieces of work.So,it is credit to director\u000aFrank Darabont,who would later go on to helm another SK adaptation,the\u000aonly slightly inferior Green Mile,that he has managed to do just that.Of all the Stephen King books and short stories that I've read,I've\u000anever actually come across Rita Hayworth and the Shawshank\u000aRedemption,yet I was still able to appreciate this films on all the\u000alevels it deserves to be appreciated on.Everything just comes together and works like magic.On the performances\u000afront,as the narrator and co-star,Freeman adds solid,engaging and\u000amemorable support,but it has to be said he's been in better roles\u000aand,for all he's worth,he's outshone in the leading role by Robbins,who\u000arightfully earned the Oscar nomination,and was only cheated in not\u000agetting it.He delivers a powerful,intensely focused portrayal of a man\u000awho appears in complete acceptance of all the events that have\u000atranspired around him and is fighting his own personal demons to adapt\u000ato the changes that are happening all around him.I don't think I can\u000aremember him delivering a more entertaining performance in any other\u000afilm I've seen him in.Other great support comes from Bob Gunton as the\u000abible-preaching yet corrupt warden and Clancy Brown as his sadistic\u000aright hand man/guard,but,in fairness to them all,they all take a back\u000aseat to Robbins.Despite it's grim themes,the film somehow also manages to be a\u000abeautiful one of hope."Get busy living...or get busy dying" says\u000aAndy,high-lighting how from the direst of situations,what one makes of\u000ait can ultimately deaden despair and bring...well,hope.The topic of how\u000aincarceration can bring about institutionalization is also brought\u000aup,and how,for those serving life sentences,the ultimate\u000apunishment,having spent most of their life in jail,is to be freed at\u000aall,to a world that will have passed them by and an age they will\u000astruggle to come to terms with."When they send you to Shawshank State\u000aPrison,that's exactly what they take...your life",another line from the\u000afilm that captures perfectly what it's trying to say.Some would appear detracted that the film has a presentation that is\u000amore fitting to a TV movie than a major Hollywood production.But\u000aconsidering it could be put in the same league as all the\u000aeffects-reliant blockbusters,the further the film could do to distance\u000aitself from those kinds of film,in my opinion,the better.In it's tenth anniversary year,this is a film that everyone who would\u000alike to call themselves a film connoisseur owes it to themselves to\u000asee.Considering all the rubbish that gets released nowadays,it's good\u000aand refreshing to know that as comparatively recently as ten years\u000aago,it was still possible to see quality stuff like this emerge out the\u000awoodwork every so often.I consider it to be one of the greatest films\u000aever made (thoroughly deserving of it's position at No.3 on the IMDb\u000aTop 100 list!) and easily on a par only with Stand By Me as the\u000agreatest King novel to make it to the big screen.It truly is a film of\u000amajestic quality and brilliance.*****\u000a

V\u000a\u000aI'd heard so much about this film, everyone who told me about it, sang its\u000apraises. My ex boyfriend said he'd cried at the end. It's even ranked #2 in\u000aimdb's top 250 movies. So you can imagine that as I settled down to watch\u000athis film, I was expecting something out of the ordinary. Unfortunately for me, it was *very* ordinary. Ok sure, there's some great\u000atwists and some parts keep you on the edge of your seat. But the pace was\u000aslow and dragged in parts, *SPOILER* just like Andy's possesions when he\u000aescapes. A few rare films I've watched, American Beauty for example, have\u000amade me go "wow" afterwards and stayed with me long after the film has\u000afinished. Due to all the hype, I was expecting to feel the same after\u000awatching "Shawshank" but all I feel is that most of the film is instantly\u000aforgettable and cheesy. I suspect that most of the people who have rated this film a 9 or 10\u000ahaven't had the opportunity to see many films that haven't had the\u000a"Hollywood" conveyor belt behind them. My advice to them is to give smaller,\u000alow budget films a watch. You may be pleasantly surprised.\u000a

V\u000a\u000aWhile the acting is rather good, not all performances are flawless, nor\u000amatched with each other as well as they could be\u000a(see Godfather 1 and 2, Goodfella's, even Pulp Fiction for near flawless\u000aensemble acting in films).The film works but is a multi-derivative film, borrowing similar characters\u000afrom several films and fashioning a film of fairly corny and unbelievable\u000amelodramatic moments to ultimately preach a message of\u000ahope.While it's an entertaining film, it's not a very good film at all.  It's\u000astrongest moments are borrowed from prison films as\u000afar back as 1930's Up the River which starred Spencer Tracy\u000aand\u000aHumphrey Bogart (in his second role).   While Shawshank is superior overall\u000athan some of the film it borrows from, it does not go any place other films\u000ahave not already been before.  While at times it borders on being brutal, it\u000astill is completely done with a rose colored glasses sensibility.  Were it\u000ato more accurately portray any semblance of what the situation would be like\u000ait would be at times very difficult to watch and emotionally\u000aexhausting--which this film is not.I am rather surprised it has received such high praise from so many.  I\u000asuppose if voters would see films such as Attica, Breaker Morant, Brubaker,\u000aCool Hand Luke, Cry Danger, The Glass House, Papillon, Pressure Point\u000a(1962), Riot in Cellblock 11,\u000aShort Eyes, and Yol for starters (films which concern men who are\u000aprisoners), they would realize how much of this film is borrowed from prior\u000afilms.\u000a

V\u000aA fair number of the movies that rank high on this site's top 250 all\u000atime list also share a parallel 'life' as literature, so let's start\u000athere.The book "Rita Hayworth, etc..." is the best of the 'Different Seasons'\u000atetralogy. King adhered to the first person perspective, which is a\u000achallenge: the narrator can only know what comes into his range of\u000aperception. You as the reader have to decide if you trust him, and so\u000aon. King wrote this in the early hand-to-mouth period of his existence\u000a-- and what do we have? A prisoner who persistently writes to his\u000abenefactors for 'more funding'.Darabont didn't have the skill necessary to really offer anything of\u000aartistic value here. We're stuck with borrowings: parts of "Convict\u000a99", "Gilda", "Brubaker", "Birdman of Alcatraz"; musically, the\u000a"Marriage of Figaro" aria -- it's actually not a bad bit of\u000aself-reference. It's the only good visual part here, and even that is\u000asmothered by the narration; literarily, Dumas' "...Monte Cristo"...The book does a good job of playing with the readers' expectations and\u000ausing irony. There's no preaching. And it ends far more intelligently\u000athan this does; the denouement here seems to belong in a different\u000amovie altogether.This isn't a bad movie; considering the obscene amount of money\u000ainvested in these things, it's hard to find a truly bad movie any more\u000a-- one with no cinematic value at all -- that wasn't the case 20 - 30\u000ayears ago. But there's no way I can love it. It just isn't the sort of movie that\u000aresonates with *me*, because the story is just 'there' with no life of\u000aits own.\u000a

V\u000aI did not see a "goof" submission area, so I feel compelled to comment\u000aon this movie's fatal flaws.Andy's cell was consistently laid out even right up to the night of his\u000aescape as he sat on his bed staring at the Rachel Welch poster. There\u000ain lies the flaw. If Andy crawled through his snug tunnel as depicted,\u000awith his clothes in tow, how did he get that poster to lay so flat to\u000awhere it even appeared to be glued to the wall? It was so flat that\u000aeven the Warden's commotion (rock throwing) in an open-air cell never\u000amoved that poster once. Given that, what about the sanitation pipe area\u000athat was equally open and subject to drafts and air movements, which\u000awould have easily moved the poster. Nailing, tacking, Velcro, and\u000ataping are out too. Even if he had tried to exit feet first he would\u000ahave had to move some furniture, given the height of the tunnel's\u000aaccess off the ground. The guard found nothing unusual in the cell, as\u000aif Andy had vanished into thin air!The sanitary pipe leaves a lot to be desired as well. A thick-walled\u000apipe of that diameter would need to be saw-cut in two places and have\u000athe section removed in order to allow enough room for Andy's body to\u000afit. Armed with only a rock it would have taken Andy another year to\u000aget through the pipe. The director would have been better off\u000ainstalling a manhole access.Last but not least, the wool suit Andy wears in the bank looks\u000aspectacular for being crumpled up in a plastic bag only hours before\u000athe bank opened. Given the location of his rain soaked prison clothes\u000aand the time of day after a 500 yard crawl, Andy would have hastily\u000achanged in the rain and that suit would have been ruined. Unless he was\u000apacking a London Fog topcoat with him he would have had to make a visit\u000ato a dry cleaner and had a two-day wait on his clothes at best. I wish\u000ahe would pack for me on my trips!"Redemption" is a good movie, but not a great one.\u000a

V\u000a\u000aSatisfying, good movie, but the only great part of this movie is the\u000amagnificent performance by Morgan Freeman. An apparently inspired Tim\u000aRobbins rises above his very mediocre talent and delivers an adequate\u000aperformance. Ham-handed attempts at profundity in every scene get tiring as\u000ais the use of every prison movie device, character, and cliche in the\u000ahistory of hollywood. \u000a

V\u000aWell, after all the glory this film has had, I decided to watch it. And\u000afor my opinion, it wasn't that great. Was it the hype, I don't know..I\u000ajust didn't like that much to esteem the movie as #2 in IMDb top 250\u000alist. It was just as boring as Stephen King's book are. Afer all,\u000aacting was great, I have no bad things say about that, it's only a bad\u000ascript, for my opinion. Nowadays, when there's such realistic prison\u000adescriptions, as OZ and Prison break, this one doesn't give the spark.\u000aFor a good prison movie I reckon the following: If you wanna see a good\u000aprison movie, you should watch ' Blood In Blood Out ', If you haven't\u000ahad a chance already. Now, there's a reality check and a great movie,\u000awhich haven't lost it's best-before date, like this one has.\u000a

V\u000a\u000aLast week, I had seen "The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King" and I\u000afeel it is one of the best movies ever made, especially in these hard to\u000aentertain folks at the movies for $10 a seat times. I couldn't understand\u000ahow some, as minority as their voices were, could not like that\u000afilm.That was until I decided to sit down and write how I feel about this film.In the 9 years since it has come out, I have attempted to watch it 12 times.\u000aThree of those times, I slept through it. I finally took some extra caffine\u000aCoke and gave it a twirl -- twice. Sorry, I just didn't warm up to this\u000afilm. Robbins and Freeman's acting was good, but I guess the story wasn't\u000aoriginal -- or surprising to me. I just didn't care about these guys, nor\u000aanyone else. It's prison. The guilty as well as the innocent are there -- I\u000aget that concept. Sometimes you're released after serving time, sometimes\u000ayou're not. You make friends...fine. I dunno, kinda reminds me of 4 years of\u000aHigh School or college I guess. I just don't care about those folks no\u000amatter what we all did together once I got out, which is why I just didn't\u000acare about these and wondered why they should. Move on. Thanks for sharing.\u000aSnooze.First I thought, I might not be a big "prison" entertainment fan, but then I\u000aremembered one of my favorite films is "Birdman of Alcatraz" (which I\u000athought much from this film owes homage to), I really fell in love with "The\u000aGreen Mile" (which was more on King's level than this) and I actually sat\u000athrough a few seasons of HBO's "Oz" which was gritty and scary, to say the\u000aleast. I give everything a chance, in fact -- several chances. But sometimes\u000anot all things appeal to all people. For me, this was one of them. (If\u000ayou're wondering, "Reservoir Dogs" is another.)The point is...as I was going to write awful things to those few folks who\u000adidn't like "The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King", I find myself\u000ahere at "The Shawshank Redemption", and now I am able to stand where they\u000awere -- for a moment -- in the minority.All things are not wonderful to all people.And that's....a good thing.\u000a

V\u000a\u000aThis movie is absurdly overrated by people who think soppy affirmative\u000amoviemaking accompanied by a lush score is synonymous with aesthetic\u000abrilliance.    The direction is nothing to write home about, the cinematography is,\u000afrankly, standard.  The script has Steven King written all over it - a\u000amelodramatic plot involving the woes of an educated bloke told in\u000aoverwrought dialogue full of clumsy metaphors.  (A good example: the moment\u000awhen the scriptwriter decided that the prisoner's interest in geology had to\u000abe spelled out for the dumber members of the audience "It's all about TIME\u000aand PRESSURE..." just in case anyone managed to miss the connection). \u000aMorgan Freeman is, as usual, superb but Tim Robbins is inconsistent as a man\u000awho goes from being the gaol newcomer to an old hand.  While the film's\u000asympathetic liberal political stance can be commended, it's certainly not a\u000agreat work of art.\u000a

V\u000aIn 1946, a banker named Andy Dufresne (Tim Robbins) is convicted of a\u000adouble murder, even though he stubbornly proclaims his innocence. He's\u000asentenced to a life term at the Shawshank State Prison in Maine, where\u000aanother lifer, Ellis "Red" Redding (Morgan Freeman), picks him as the\u000anew recruit most likely to crack under the pressure. The ugly realities\u000aof prison life are quickly introduced to Andy: a corrupt warden (Bob\u000aGunton), sadistic guards led by Capt. Byron Hadley (Clancy Brown), and\u000ainmates who are little better than animals, willing to use rape or\u000abeatings to insure their dominance. But Andy does not crack: he has the\u000ahope of the truly innocent, which (together with his smarts) allow him\u000ato prevail behind bars. He uses his banking skills to win favor with\u000athe warden and the guards, doing the books for Norton's illegal\u000abusiness schemes and keeping an eye on the investments of most of the\u000aprison staff. In exchange, he is able to improve the prison library and\u000abring some dignity and respect back to many of the inmates, including\u000aRed. Based on a story by Stephen King, The Shawshank Redemption was the\u000adirectorial debut of screenwriter Frank Darabont. ~ Mark Deming, Rovi\u000a

V\u000aThis film is no. 1 on the top 250. I would have to disagree with that.\u000aThe reason why I don't think it deserves to be 1 or even 25 for that\u000amanner is...Tim Robbins acting and this might be coming from a biased\u000apoint of view because I have never liked Tim Robbins in any one of his\u000afilms. I have never liked him because of his slow delivery that makes\u000ahim sound a little bit like Robert De Niro in Awakenings. Also another\u000areason I don't think it deserves to be no. 1 is because of it's plot.\u000aThis plot is completely unoriginal. I mean wow an African-American man\u000aand a white man become friends in pre civil-rights movement America.\u000aOne of the few things I did enjoy was the whole middle part (i'll try\u000anot to give too much away.) The middle part consists of Morgan Freeman\u000agetting out of jail and searching for Andy Dufrane (Tim Robbins). Also\u000aone of the few things that is fantastic about this film is the\u000asupporting acting and the Directing of this film. Overall I would put\u000a"Shawshank" at about 35 on this list.\u000a

V\u000aI can see why this movie is loved because it is moving and a great\u000aemotional experience, however #2 on the IMDb 250. Is this madness? It\u000adoesn't deserve to be mentioned in the same sentence as the Godfather.\u000aIn comparison to the Godfather lets see:1. Is it better directed than the Godfather? Not even nearly close come\u000aon this movie didn't even get a nomination while Coppola has directed a\u000amasterpiece for all time.2. Is it better Acted than the Godfather? Please Morgan Freedman vs.\u000aBrando No question and the Godfather has better supporting actors all\u000aaround.3. Better Screenplay? That is a joke, Mario Puzo owns it4. Better Music? Forget about the Godfather music is famous.5. So is it all around? not a chanceAs for the movie overall, I did like it but it is good not GREAT. I\u000afound it moving and a good film for the triumph of human spirit (its\u000anot better than a flew over the cuckoo's nest either) and I found it to\u000abe a good movie. On AFI's top 100 list, it was at 72 which is a more\u000aappropriate for it. I only compared to the Godfather because the\u000aGodfather and Shawshank are in the battle for #1 when its no contest.\u000aThe ending was a fairy tale too. Yeah sure people always break out of\u000ajail with a rock chipper and then move to Mexico with their pal that\u000athey met in the joint. Please.\u000a

V\u000aStephen King is a talentless, third-rate writer, so comparing him to\u000aEdgar Allen Poe is like comparing excrement to ripe peaches. Let's\u000aforget about King's ineptness as a writer for a moment, shall we? This\u000aguy goes to prison and every prison personnel is rotten to the core\u000awhile our convicted heroes are innocent, philosophical gurus. Only in a\u000adeluded, fantastical, distorted mind can a thing like that be\u000aconcocted. Grandpa god (Morgan Freeman) recounts the hammy story of an\u000ainnocent, hopeful, freedom-craving banker. I am already getting\u000adiarrhea thinking about this stupid plot, so let me recommend a couple\u000aof good films about corruption in prison: The Glass House (1972) and\u000aBrubaker (1980).\u000a

V\u000aThe condition of the human soul. Many movies have done it better. The\u000areviews embrace only what they know...why don't they know more? Tom\u000aHanks is OK. Everything about this movie is OK...but only OK. IMDb herd\u000amentality. Internet clickings etc...Learn something about truth. Shaw s\u000ahank is missing something. There are much better social justice movies.\u000aThe ridiculously high rating on the net only shows the net isn't all\u000athat its cracked up to be. There is no one in this cast that would put\u000athis movie ahead of TO KILL A MOCKINGBIRD...so why do you? The internet\u000ais filled with fools with keyboards. If you believe that this movie is\u000asuperior to TKAM ...it only speaks to your access to a\u000acomputer...nothing more. The internet is dead. Reality killed the\u000ainternet star. Ooops.

V\u000aFirst of all I am by no means a Shawshank hater nor I'm I here to troll\u000athe film or its fans for it being ranked this high on the IMDb top 250.\u000aShawshank I must say is a rather enjoyable watch with a decent\u000aperformance from Tim Robbins, a particular good one from Morgan\u000aFreeman, a decent storyline and a nice ending. However that said I\u000awould not put it anywhere near my top 50 movies list and I'm pretty\u000asure I could name at least 30 films, twenty of which are not even\u000aranked in the 250 that are IMO way better than Shawshank in their use\u000aof story telling and making you study them in your head even after\u000ayou've watched them many times. It would perhaps be safe to say that\u000awhat ever it does for many other people it just didn't do for me. The\u000astory was fairly predictable from start to finish and although I did\u000aappreciate its ending I found it to be too much your typical Hollywood\u000asort of ending where every things happy and all loose ends have been\u000atied up etc. I've now seen this movie four times and I must say I still\u000afind it to be very overrated, when I see it voted number two of all\u000atime then I think of how there are so many other movies out there not\u000aeven in the 250. Oh well I guess popularity polls can never be just the\u000away one would like them to be. Overall I give The Shawshank Redemption\u000a6/10 stars I would have given it a seven or a eight only with the\u000aamount of high votes and rankings its got over the years on this site,\u000aI just felt it wasn't in need of such charity. As stated above a very\u000aenjoyable prison drama but just nowhere near in the same league as The\u000aGodfather, Star Wars and The Lord of the Rings trilogies. But hey thats\u000aonly my opinion and thats what makes us all different isn't it?\u000a

V\u000aWhen i first saw this I came away thinking it was an entertaining piece\u000aof movie making but nothing particularly special. I simply cannot\u000aunderstand why it features so highly in many top movie listings. Yes\u000athe story is good and has a nice happy ending. Andy is a character who\u000ais easy to identify with against the nefarious, sadistic warden. This\u000aunchallenging hackneyed dichotomy is helped by Andy's buddies vs the\u000anasty gang who's leader is intent on a slightly different kind of\u000arelationship with Andy.The actors all shine and it's well photographed but is simply nothing\u000aspecial, it certainly doesn't warrant it's apparent stellar position in\u000afilm history. I think it is the most overrated film of all time, no\u000aquestion. It isn't even a standout in it's own genre and is way way too\u000along in it's telling of a tale that is unoriginal and intellectually\u000aundemanding .\u000a

V\u000aI still cannot understand this films continued high regard. Yes, it's a\u000agood drama and the acting is pretty solid if unspectacular. But it is\u000athe most sickly saccharine and clichéd movie I have ever scene, which\u000aoften throws logic straight out of the window.The depiction of prison life is pretty ridiculous. Different races all\u000agetting on fine, apart from the small group of 'bad guys'. The ending\u000ais absolutely awful. If it had ended with red getting released it would\u000ahave been marginally better. However, to do the typical Hollywood thing\u000aof explaining exactly what happens is just rubbish. Note to Hollywood,\u000awe can use our brains! I think this film is 2nd in the IMDb Top 250,\u000acan someone please explain why? It's a very average film and be warned\u000ait will make you sick with its cheesiness!\u000a

V\u000aIt's predictable from the first to the last minute. I can't believe\u000ait's second in worldwide history. Well... first is other predictable\u000amovie (The Nerd of the Ring). This situation reminds me of Brave New\u000aWorld. One of the future citizens in there goes to a theater to see a\u000amovie with "the savage". The future and civilized man (or woman, I\u000adon't remember) is fascinated with it. But the Savage tries to make him\u000anotice that the plot was a truly rubbish, truly predictable and truly\u000auntruly. Now, what's the problem? ALL THE MOVIES ARE EQUALS. So, the\u000afuture one can't distingue and decide in a correct way. He has NO\u000aOPTION. That's what is going on here. And not only in movies...\u000a

V\u000aWhen I first saw this movie in 1994, before the hype, I thought it was\u000aa passable flick; nothing special and certainly in keeping with the\u000ausual schmaltz expected from any non-horror Stephen King work. In fact,\u000awith the exception of Morgan Freeman's excellent performance, I found\u000ait imminently forgettable. Then, lo, came the Academy Awards with a\u000asurprising nomination for Best Picture. Then, even worse, came the\u000abelated hype from its legion of fans. I could not understand this\u000aadoration of a movie that was as sugar-coated as that other saccharine\u000amovie of 94, Forrest Gump. Worse than Gump's unpalatable cuteness,\u000ahowever, was Shawshank's genre clichés: the rape scene, the prisoner's\u000apet, etc. Had no-one seen Escape From Alcatraz or Birdman of Alcatraz?\u000aFor me, Shawshank is possibly the most overrated film ever made, a fact\u000aemphasised by its place at No. 2 in the IMDb top 250.\u000a

Or how about Scum or even Chopper.I have to admit I felt the same way about The Green Mile, maybe it's just\u000aStephen King's view of prison I don't like.  As if he has a\u000aclue!I think he should just stick with the coming of age stuff (loved Stand By\u000aMe) and the isolated looneys (The Shining), things he can obviously relate\u000ato.

V\u000aThis film is nicely told, ably acted, and neatly directed. It is an\u000aeminently watchable movie. But what on Earth is it doing listed as the\u000ahighest rated film on IMDb? Yes, this film is better than average, but\u000anot much, much better.There is an interesting twist to the way that this film approaches its\u000astory. Its narrative building blocks are those of the familiar all-male\u000aprison tale, but the script operates like an old-fashioned Hollywood\u000awomen's picture. This allows the movie to explore a series of\u000amelodramatic situations, but to people these situations with just men.\u000aAs a result, even as the movie acts tough, it relentlessly explores its\u000acharacters' unsatisfied emotional needs. Lots of opportunities for\u000arestrained male tears ensue, often to good effect.I know that my next comment is going to anger a lot of readers, but\u000athis film's exceedingly high rating on IMDb explains why cultural\u000aelites, and not the masses, end up determining which works of art have\u000alasting value. When everyone's voice is equal, non-offensive, but\u000amerely better-than-average movies such as this one rocket to to the top\u000aof the list. It's like when every judge's third choice ends up winning\u000abecause each judge's first and second choices were daring works that\u000aended up being at least one other judge's last choice. Rating films by\u000acommittee clearly does not work.Again, this is not a bad movie, but it is most certainly not the best\u000afilm ever made.\u000a

V\u000aThis film is much overrated. it is a typical Hollywood film. there is\u000anot at one time any surprise in the whole plot. everything happens as\u000ayou expect it. everybody loves this guy, everybody wants to help him.\u000ahe of course is shy and always nice. the sound makes the film more\u000aawful than great. too sentimental. too cheap. the film is like a fairy\u000atale. and yes, there are enough good films about prisons. like Brubaker\u000awith Robert Redford, sleepers, or even the worse film with Sylvester\u000aStallone, in which a prisoner gets a chance to drive a car for the\u000afirst time in his life in the midst of the prison. wow, super\u000asentimental. not a good story though. this is nothing new. and the\u000adialogs or monologues of Morgan Freeman are nice, i admit. but, well,\u000acant compete with texts of good books. so, not the best quality. the\u000aplot also is very simple. the guards are very bad guys, the director is\u000acorrupt. every time the same story. nothing original. so i think that\u000a9,1 points is very too much. there are enough films with a better\u000amessage and plot, and whatever. the actors also aren't so superior.\u000ait's a typical Hollywood film, like i said. with a hero, with a lot of\u000asentimental music, and other things which the average person likes in\u000aHollywood movies. not a classic.\u000a

V\u000a\u000aIs there anyone who does not like this film?  If there is, I've never met\u000athem.  "The Shawshank Redemption" is a film that doesn't sound too\u000ainteresting when you first hear about it.  A banker who protests his\u000ainnocence after his wife and her lover are killed befriends a group of\u000aprisoners and changes everyone's life for the better.  It does not sound\u000athat great to most people, but when you see this film you will honestly come\u000aaway loving every frame of it.  Tim Robbins is great, Morgan Freeman is\u000agreater, and the supporting cast are all perfect.  William Sadler, Bob\u000aGunton, Clancy Brown, and Gil Bellows stand out as well.  James Whitmore,\u000awho has been in acting since the 1940s, gives his best performance as Brooks\u000aand should have at least received an Oscar nod.  If you haven't seen this\u000afilm go and see it.  I can't think of any movie I'd rather watch on a rainy\u000aafternoon, or at anytime for that matter.  Frank Darabont, who had been\u000ainvolved in horror films before this, became a big-time name after this\u000afilm.  Unfortunately, "The Green Mile" is nowhere close to comparing to this\u000afilm which will be remembered forever.  A great achievement.  5 stars out of\u000a5.   \u000a

V\u000a\u000aIn the long and storied history of cinema, there have always been those\u000afilms, which are undoubtly overrated.  However, none before and none since\u000ahave been more overrated then The Shawshank Redemption.  While the Shawshank\u000aRedemption is not a waste of your viewing times by any means, it is not the\u000apinnacle of film making.  The performances are good, especially Freeman, but\u000aI'm not too high on the way the plot works out.  It doesn't really break any\u000anew ground, a man is wrongfully convicted of a crime he didn't commit(Wow,\u000athat's new!!), and learns to cope with his new circumstances, while\u000abefriending the prison veterans.  While the audience learns a valuable\u000alesson about the determination and courage of the human spirit!  I don't\u000aknow about you all, but when Robbins escapes from prison during a dramatic\u000athunderstorm, there were more then a few tears coming down my face.  When I\u000asee something like this rated in the top 10 films of the 1990s let alone of\u000aall time, I have to wonder about people's taste in general.  The message of\u000athe movie isn't incredibly powerful nor is the plot.  How can anyone\u000aconsciously say this movie was the best ever?  It boggles my mind, but I\u000ahave a few theories.  First this movie is recent enough and shown on TNT\u000aenough (like 5 times a month), that alot of people have seen it more then\u000aonce.  Younger people (I'm talking teens and twenties), who haven't seen\u000amany Dramas let alone the real "great" movies, will say this is the best.\u000aIf you ask this same demographic what is the best comedy of all time, they\u000aare likely to say something like Happy Gilmore (which Caddyshack blows out\u000aof the water for best golf comedy).  These are the kinds of people giving\u000aShawshank it's highest praise, these people are sadly my generation.\u000a

V\u000aIt seems that every time a movie comes out with an exceedingly positive\u000aand uplifting message or story, the average moviegoer is blind to any\u000aother problems or shortcomings the film might have. Every moment of\u000athis film feels phony and hollow. The character of Red (Morgan Freeman)\u000ais just a vehicle to keep the plot moving and doesn't seem to even\u000aexist as a whole person. His narration is embarrassing with its phony\u000aregional dialect and forced folksiness. The prison life depicted, while\u000abrutal and violent in a few scenes, is overromanticized by the\u000apicturesque cinematography and florid music. The plot is fairly clever\u000abut, like bad American television, everything that happens is in\u000aservice of the plot. There's no behavior from the characters that\u000adoesn't help bring you to the film's stunningly maudlin final scene.\u000aAnd there are logistical problems, like the fact that you can't make a\u000ahole in a thick metal sewer pipe by hitting it with a rock three times.\u000aThey could have solved this problem by just showing a shot of a clock\u000amoving forward. The best character is a relatively brief and peripheral\u000aone, Brooks (James Whitmore). Whitmore doesn't seem to know he's in\u000asuch a shallow, contrived movie and gives the character a realism and\u000athree-dimensionality the other characters don't have in his short time\u000aon screen. In the montage-type scene in which he's trying to cope with\u000alife out of prison, however, he suddenly seems less intelligent and\u000amore of a stereotype of a befuddled old man. Tim Robbins as Andy\u000aDufresne is somewhere between good and mediocre, seeming to force weird\u000aexpressions onto his face like he just read the character description\u000ain the script for the first time. Bob Gunton as Warden Norton is\u000aover-the-top and seemingly one-dimensional, but it works because\u000aBible-thumpers are often over-the-top and seemingly one-dimensional.\u000aHe's actually believable and interesting to watch. The prison guard\u000aHadley (Clancy Brown) is realistically sadistic, but his type of\u000acomically crude sexual language sounds too contemporary for the time.\u000aThe final scene is just so unrealistically over-the-top happy and sunny\u000ait's an insult to the viewer's intelligence and, I think, ruins much of\u000athe film. This film obviously has developed a huge following over the\u000ayears, but I think that's largely just because of it's sentiment of\u000ahopefulness and positivity, and that doesn't necessarily indicate a\u000awell-written, well-executed, well-acted film. Some of the worst crap in\u000atheatres and on television has a hopeful, inspiring, uplifting message.\u000aOf course a film doesn't have to depict a realistic world. In fact, I\u000alike surrealism in movies. But it should at least show an interesting\u000aversion of a world, and to keep any intelligent viewer's attention the\u000acharacters have to be fully realized, seemingly existing in a world\u000aoutside of the film's plot.\u000a

V\u000aI enjoyed this movie, but I still regard it as one of the most vastly\u000aover-rated films of all time. The villains in the film were\u000a2-dimensional caricatures. There were no shades of gray in this film\u000awhatsoever. I can accept such villains when some element of the fairy\u000atale, some element of the supernatural is introduced. For instance, it\u000awas okay for Chigurh to be cartoonish in No Country For Old Men because\u000ahe was clearly supposed to be a symbol, a force of nature. The warden\u000ain Shawshank Redemption, on the other hand, isn't a force of nature,\u000amerely a poorly-written character. Honestly, the Shawshank Redemption was absorbing, but it wasn't a\u000a"great film" (in the capital-letters sense) by any stretch of the\u000aimagination.\u000a

I enjoyed many other movies on the top 250 more than this\u000afilm. If you want a great movie on the list check out The incredibles\u000aor the wrestler or toy story.

V\u000aJust having registered with IMDb, I thought a good movie to start my\u000areviewing with would be the one which users have rated the best of the\u000abest. This is one of my favorite films & over the years I have watched\u000ait or portions of it whenever it happening to be playing on TV,\u000aprobably mustering up a good 20-30 viewings to the point that I thought\u000aI could nearly recite the films dialogue word for word. That anyone\u000acould rate any film 10 out of 10 I figure is more a function of the\u000amind of the viewer, and its penchant for exaggeration after watching a\u000afilm which happens to induce some powerful emotions in him, rather than\u000aany inherent perfection in the piece. Whatever the truth may be I offer\u000ahere some reasons why this particular film, although moving and well\u000amade in it's own right, cannot be the best film made by the hands of\u000aman.#6: It seemed to me that the evidence for convicting Andy at the\u000abeginning was badly inadequate. There was no murder weapon found & no\u000aprints of his found inside the building the murders took place. His\u000astory was consistent, and though he had motive for getting wasted and\u000adriving around, its a big step to murder, and what guilty man freely\u000aadmits he had a gun and planned on using it to scare the adulterers,\u000awhen on trial for his life? An upright, honest man with faith and trust\u000ain the judicial system, thats who. Small wonder he was so shocked to\u000ahere the judge give his sentence. And who was Andy's lawyer, Lionel\u000aHutz?, did they not dust the murder scene for prints to give an idea of\u000aa possible involvement from another party etc?#5: The night he decides to escape just happens to be a stormy one with\u000aloud peals of thunder perfectly disguising his rocking the sewage line?\u000ac'mon!#4: The guy has been in the same cell for 19 years. All the time an\u000aenormous poster has been draped over the subway tunnel like hole to\u000afreedom he has been digging away at each night. No guard in that span\u000afelt he might have a curious peek-a-boo under the poster during the\u000acell checks?#3: I was a little incredulous at the good faith the warden seemed to\u000ashow Andy after he had completed his 2nd warden ordered ordeal in the\u000ahole. "Its good to have you back Andy, place has'nt been the same\u000awithout you" Did the warden remember putting Andy in the hole in the\u000a1st place, for pleading and proving his innocence to him, remember\u000ahaving the man shot who could have restored Andy's life, I thought a\u000aman smart enough to contrive all of the fraudulent operations that were\u000amaking the warden rich would at least merit a small deal of suspicion\u000afrom the warden. "what else might this man be capable of?"#2: Andy's job on the outside was as a banker not a priest, the movie\u000acontinues to show how clever he is and flexible at making the most of\u000ahis limited resources in the joint, but when and how did he find time\u000ato memorize that enormous book that is the bible? passage for passage,\u000aline for line? his mastery of this difficult book is shown in giving\u000athe exact chapter and line reference after the warden quotes him a\u000asegment of the book. Perhaps that is why his wife wanted to leave him,\u000aafter work he was up all night till 4am memorizing segments of the\u000abible, but more likely not.#1: Finally and I thought most implausibly, the new guy Andy taught to\u000aread and write just happened to have the information on the "real\u000akiller" For this to happen I thought the following chance happenings\u000awould have to conspire: 1: he happens to share a cell with the killer\u000aat some other prison 2: the killer chooses to tell him that he killed a\u000acouple & a banker got the blame for it 3: he finds himself in another\u000aprison where Andy resides 4: of the many convicts, he happens to form a\u000afriendship with red and Andy and their small crew 5: red happens to\u000aspill the beans about Andy's crime to him I thought all this was a\u000alittle unlikelyIn summary, great movie, great dialogue, excellent performances, and\u000agreat vindication of the power of hope, the rewards of perseverance and\u000athe importance of sticking to ones core values regardless of external\u000acircumstances, not the best of the best, but what is? 7 out of 10\u000a

I'd give it a 7-8/10 (Freeman & Co. do not\u000adisappoint), but someone needs to bring down this bloated rating. The\u000afilm is little more than a rehashing of conventional sentimentalism\u000apainted in prison stripes and sold in bulk to a (apparently) gullible\u000aaudience.

Then you may watch it again because you remember enjoying it the\u000afirst time. On the third viewing you are beginning to tire of it and\u000athe characters seem more contrived and you begin to see how the script\u000ahas some flaws. Still - all and all - its better than most. A great\u000amovie (and there are many) is a movie that no matter how many times you\u000awatch it you marvel at the script - the performances - the music - all\u000athe things we love about the movies. The Shawshank Redemption doesn't\u000acome close. Well made, good performances, but not great and not\u000adeserving of being on ANY top ten movie list of all time.\u000a

V\u000aTim Robbins and Morgan Freeman to very good actors star in this movie\u000aabout Tim wrongfully accused and sent to prison where he befriends\u000aMorgan Freeman. I mean it was a good movie and a i liked it, it just\u000adidn't blow me away and I guess thats how I rate a movie from Good or\u000aGreat, I like it don't get me wrong, its just i didn't get the same\u000afeeling i get from other great movies, it didn't have me thinking about\u000athe character, whats happening next, it wasn't riveting, it was kinda\u000aslow I guess just dragging from scene to scene. To be perfectly honest\u000aI would personally rank this movie at like an 8.1 - 8.2, I guess I just\u000akinda figured that he would get out, and a movie like that where you\u000acan pretty much guess whats going to happen there is much to stay and\u000awatch, I didn't feel they would leave the movie with him in prison and\u000athats pretty much what did it for me.I mean this is purely my opinion,\u000aI know some people who love this movie and they bring up their valid\u000apoints, but right now I am sharing my point of view with everyone about\u000athis movie.\u000a

V\u000aLet me start by stating that this is one of the most sad, poignant and\u000abeautiful films I've seen since Paranormal Entity. I feet that Tom\u000aHanks' portrayal of a bored police officer was cutting edge at the time\u000aand has yet to be surpassed by any actor in any film since, excluding\u000aShane Van Dyke's potentially career defining performance in Shane Van\u000aDyke's Paranormal Entity (written by Shane Van Dyke). Michael Clarke\u000aDuncan's interpretation of the character John Cofey was banal to say\u000athe least, but I was more than compensated for this error in judgement\u000awith two deliciously witty comedy set pieces. One was where a rat got\u000aknocked out and one was where he forgot to put a sponge on his head. As\u000aan aside, I enjoyed the skit in which Michael Clarke Duncan refused to\u000agive Moon's Sam Rockwell a slice of bread and the bit where Tom Hanks\u000acouldn't take a wazz.In conclusion, I award this film 2 golden skulls. Half a star for the\u000ascene where the rat dies, and one star for Tim Robins crawling through\u000aa crapper. I am also awarding the film two golden skulls for the scene\u000ain which Tom Hanks bangs his wife after John Cofey heals him.Overall - 3 golden skulls (Paranormal Entity earned 9 golden skulls)\u000acheers\u000a

V\u000aLet me start out by stating the fact that I am a HUGE Morgan Freeman\u000afan. I absolutely adore most of his work, however, The Shawshank\u000aRedemption is the only exception as to just how far my love of Morgan\u000aFreeman will go. First of all, in the opening scene, when Morgan is\u000agetting rubbed down by two husky white men in the shower, the hot water\u000ahandle should be facing the LEFT, unless this film was shot in Canada\u000aor Utah, I see no reason for this subtle inaccuracy. Second, why did\u000aBruce Willis decide to concentrate his fire strictly on the escapees of\u000athe prison?! Why not on the inmates that were tucked safely in their\u000acells?! Finally, the third and final problem that I had with this\u000amovie, is this: Hadley is arrested for murder, crying like a little\u000agirl as he is taken away, while the Warden decides to shoot his brains\u000aout.While the others would talk about Andy's exploits, Red just\u000alistens. One day he receives a blank postcard from the Border, knowing\u000athat his friend made it there in one piece.Red manages to pass the next\u000aparole hearing with an angry honesty that was missing from his past\u000ameetings, and is sent to the halfway house used by Brooks. He is lost\u000aon the outside and would like to return to Shawshank, but instead he\u000afulfills his promise to Andy, and follows his friend's plan to find the\u000atree he mentioned, and a black box containing a wad of money and a\u000aletter.Red breaks the law to violate his parole, and takes the bus down\u000ato the border. At the end, on the beaches of Zihuatanejo, we see Andy\u000aworking on a boat, about to be joined by another free man, Red.\u000aHonestly, if you're even considering watching this movie, please spend\u000ayour time elsewhere. It's terrible.\u000a

V\u000a\u000aThis film is probably the best life-in-prison film ever made.

But he isn't alone; he is joined by fellow inmate (who is the only\u000aguilty person in Shawshank) Red played also very well by Morgan Freeman. \u000aFreeman narrates the life in The Shawshank prison all the way up until the\u000aend (not to mention some very memorable escape scenes).  Very memorable,\u000ashowing what movies are made of.  Based on Stephen King's novel (one of his\u000abest) and adapted for the screen and directed by Frank Darabont, who 5 years\u000alater would write and direct the Green Mile, another good (but can't be\u000amatched to this one) prison movie.

V\u000aFear can hold you prisoner. Hope can set you free. A good tagline for a\u000agreat prison drama from writer/director Frank Darabont (The Green\u000aMile), based on the book by Stephen King. Basically Andy Dufresne (Tim\u000aRobbins) is the lawyer convicted for the murder of his wife, sent to\u000aShawshank prison, headed by the nasty Warden Samuel Norton (Bob\u000aGunton). While he is there he is quiet for a while, but eventually he\u000aforms a friendship with black Irish marketeer Ellis Boyd 'Red' Redding\u000a(Oscar and Golden Globe nominated Morgan Freeman, and the character was\u000aoriginally a white red haired Irishman), retains hope and gains respect\u000aof fellow inmates. After a while, he gets to do a lot of personal work\u000afor the Warden sorting documents, founding a new library and improving\u000aa lot of other things, with his law and mathematical skills. One day\u000athough, he seems strange towards Red when he asks him to find a\u000aspecific tree somewhere he knows, and the next morning, he has escaped\u000a(scraping through the soft wall with a chisel). Andy and Red do\u000aeventually find each other again in the happy emotional ending, well,\u000amany moments in the film are emotional. It was a flop in the cinemas,\u000aand since release to video and DVD it has become a favourite with many\u000afilm goers. Also starring William Sadler as Heywood, Clancy Brown as\u000aCaptain Byron T. Hadley, Gil Bellows as Tommy and James Whitmore as\u000aBrooks Hatlen. It was nominated the Oscars for Best Cinematography,\u000aBest Film Editing, Best Music for Thomas Newman, Best Sound, Best\u000aWriting, Screenplay Based on Material from Another Medium and Best\u000aPicture, and it was nominated the Golden Globe for Best Screenplay.\u000aMorgan Freeman was number 27 on The 100 Greatest Movie Stars, the film\u000awas number 7 on The 100 Greatest Tearjerkers for the scene where\u000aclassical operatic music plays in the prison, it was number 23 on 100\u000aYears, 100 Cheers, it was number 13 on Film 4's 50 Films To See Before\u000aYou Die, and it was number 3 on The 100 Greatest Films.

V\u000aAt the time of this review, 'The Shawshank Redemption' is the number\u000aone movie on IMDb. Why? If anything, it is probably the most clichéd\u000afilm I have ever seen with my own two eyes, and yet it is rated as the\u000atop film of all time? It blows my mind every time I visit this website.This 'film' was adapted from a novel by the renowned author Steven\u000aKing. I have not read the book, as I have already been spoiled by the\u000amovie, but apparently the writing is quite exquisite. However, Frank\u000aDarabont must have missed the entire point of Steven's works, which is\u000ato have engaging characters that you are able to sympathize with.The characters are so bland, I might as well be staring at glue dry.\u000aTim Robbins and Morgan Freeman's bromance literally develops right out\u000aof the blue after they have one conversation. Pacing? What's that?\u000aLater, you meet an old fart named Brooks, who might as well have his\u000aname changed to "I'm going to die later so feel sad-larry", and the\u000amost he contributes to the film is increasing the runtime with his\u000asub-plot about being outside after being locked in for so long. One\u000acannot forget the oh-so-memorable (sarcasm) warden who channels the\u000aspirits of every Disney villain without the accompanying song. You can\u000afind more interesting characters in a Tyler Perry movie.The worst part of the movie is definitely the passage of time. The\u000astory takes place over twenty years or so and yet the only one to\u000aactually age is the warden. Tim and Morgan stay in some special cells\u000awhere they magically do not get older and therefore nobody notices on\u000aIMDb. While a competent director would have noticed this as soon as\u000athey glanced at the script, Darabont was off in the broom closet\u000ashagging the catering chick or something.If you enjoy modern shooters then you are in for a treat. Most of this\u000amovie is full of grays, browns, mixes between, and it even has a sewer\u000asection just for the hell of it. Just when you thought the movie might\u000aget interesting when out of the prison, prepare to be disappointed.\u000aHonestly, the best shot of the movie is when Tim is crawling through\u000ash*t, as it reflects on my feelings towards the film.Music can make - or break - a movie. Here, the 'original' score only\u000aseems to try and make you cry at the most inappropriate times. The\u000amusic is too overplayed in films like this, where it takes away from\u000athe already terrible experience.This movie is as lame as they come. If you like this, fine. As the\u000aphrase says, "ignorance is bliss".\u000a

V\u000aI would just like to begin by saying the Shawshank redemption is one of\u000athe worst movies I have ever seen despite it being number 2 in the IMDb\u000atop 250 list. As I went through the movie, it was so painful, boring\u000aand everything else which makes a boring movie, unbelievably slow\u000amovie. I am aware of the fact that most people had voted this movie as\u000aan ace movie but in my opinion it was the single worst movie i have\u000aever encountered with. Although I admire the 1 actor in the movie I am\u000asad to say that for me this movie is a waste of time. I regret ever\u000awatching it. However I would not be able to say "do not watch this\u000amovie" as the voting and the scores point otherwise. In my opinion the\u000aShawshank Redemption should not even be on the 1-10000 list of the\u000amovies. It was just someone going into prison and making a difference.\u000aI am all for inspirational movies, just not this one. I would rather\u000asit and stare into a blank spot rather than wasting my time watching\u000athis movie. No offense to the actors as they were not bad but the\u000ascript, the story, the screenplay, the time period, nothing suited each\u000aother. I am just expressing how i feel about this movie and my final\u000awords to describe this movie: "DO NOT WATCH".\u000a

V\u000aThe scene where Tim Robbins crawls through 2 football fields of shits\u000asums up what watching this movie feels like. The fact that this movie\u000ais top of the IMDb top 250 list is a sign that people on this site have\u000ano concept of good film making outside of the standard Hollywood fare.\u000aThe movie may well be enjoyable, but in the end it is no more than\u000athat, enjoyable, and that is pushing it. The director's involvement\u000awith other movies outside of this speak volumes: Green Mile is in a\u000asimilar mould,whilst The Mist shows his continued obsession with\u000aStephen King. With writing credits on over five different mutations of\u000aYoung Indiana Jones's, his incompetence is evident. At the end of the\u000aday, a Hollywood remake by M.

V\u000aThis movie was inspired by the brilliant Stir Crazy starring Gene\u000aWilder and Richard Pryor. As an essay on prison life, Shawshank\u000aRedemption fails on every level that Stir Crazy managed to succeed on.Shawshank is nowhere near as funny as Stir Crazy. There is not a\u000awoodpecker suited bank robbery to be found. There is no Grossberger, no\u000ahomosexual black man hassling the heroes, no silly mania scenes. There\u000ais nothing here that even remotely comes close to emulating its\u000apredecessor.The obvious links to the original are still there: Morgan Freeman in\u000athe Richard Pryor role and Tim Robbins as Gene Wilder. However, Robbins\u000aand Freeman are nowhere near Wilder and Pryor in the acting stakes and\u000awe end up feeling disappointed at their lack of conviction (no pun\u000aintended) in the roles.\u000a

If IMDb should be accepted as\u000athe world real Bibel for film lovers, The Shawshank Redemption can't be\u000aour top movie. A lot of other movies are far better.

V\u000aWow. I love this movie. To date I have probably watched it nearly 40\u000atimes... I am not obsessive, whenever it is on, I watch it.For most movies, at least the dramatic ones, I measure them based on\u000ahow they make me feel. This one makes me feel sad when Brooks dies,\u000aangry when Tommy dies, and happy when Red finds his friend. This movie\u000amakes me feel good. I know that is not very scientific, but it's the\u000atruth. Because of the way it plays on me, I can't help but give it a\u000a10. Here's why: First off, the acting. Tim Robbins is SO subtle that he\u000astrikes me as a person that tries to bury his innocence, because in\u000areality it does not matter. Few would argue that Morgan Freeman is\u000abrilliant, as usual. But here the supporting cast throws in with\u000aequally impressive performances.The Score. Outside the music from the records appearing in the movie,\u000athe relatively unrestrictive score just helps us confirm what our eyes\u000asee, the walls of Shawshank. We feel them, through the music, and break\u000athrough them as Andy does.And last but not least, My compliments on the cinematography. The site\u000ais perfect for the movie, and the clever camera angles and lighting\u000ainvite us into the dreary prison world.just the joke :D\u000a

V\u000aBoy, this is a very popular film, and one of the reasons Liberals love\u000ait so much - in addition to the fact that it's an interesting story and\u000awell-acted - is the anti- Christian bias in here, which is very strong.You see, the villain, as in almost all modern-day prison films, is the\u000awarden. And, they go out of their way to show you that the despised\u000ahate-filled warden is a Bible Believer, of course. It's repeated and\u000ademonstrated several times as the warden quotes Scripture. And our hero\u000a(Tim Robbins) carves out the middle the Bible to use as a place to hide\u000aa tool for him to escape. Heaven forbid, the Book would be used for him\u000ato actually read! It's no coincidence since this is written by famous\u000aauthor and Christian-basher Stephen King.Amid the bigotry is an interesting story with two likable lead\u000acharacters (the other being Morgan Freeman, whose narration in the film\u000ais superb) and a very satisfying ending. Along the way we get other\u000aclichés, such as the usual sadistic guard (Clancey Brown) who beats up\u000adefenseless nice guys. This movie is so manipulative it's laughable.....but entertaining,\u000aespecially if you're another Bible basher are another naive Lib who\u000athinks that jails are filled with intelligent, sweet-natured guys like\u000aFreeman, Robbins, et al. In the world of film-making, criminals are the\u000areal "victims "of our horrible society.\u000a

V\u000aThis movie is more of a drama than action, but that doesn't matter,\u000abecause it would fail in either case. A viewer can accept the cliché of\u000athe wrongly convicted man, but this case is deceptively against the\u000agrain. Our society already has a predisposition to acquit any man of\u000amurdering his wife, a predisposition to think it is impossible, when\u000athe statistics claim the opposite. For that reason alone, this movie is\u000adangerous propaganda, and most often a lie. The characters never become\u000abelievable, mostly because of the reason stated earlier. Also, because\u000asuch men don't wind up in prison. The wrongly convicted man always\u000acomes from a different background and class. I can't imagine someone\u000afinding this movie even remotely plausible. In fact, the viewer has no\u000aidea what the "redemption" is. Nothing makes any sense.\u000a

V\u000aBased on Stephen King's novella Rita Hayworth and Shawshank Redemption,\u000aFrank Darabont's "The Shawshank Redemption" tells the story of Andy\u000aDusfresne (Tim Robbins), a gentle banker wrongly convicted for the\u000adouble murders of his wife and her lover. The story goes on to send a\u000apowerful message of friendship and hope through even the darkest times\u000aimaginable."Andy Dusfresne  who crawled through a river of s*t, and came out\u000aclean on the other side", remarks Red, narrator and man-who-knows-how-\u000ato-get-things, effortlessly played by the iconic father of narration\u000aMorgan Freeman. When we meet Red, he's 20 years into a life sentence\u000awith a jaded view of the world and initially thinks little of\u000aDusfresne. However as the months turn into years we watch them form a\u000abeautiful friendship and observe two people who truly care for each\u000aother, a rarity in many modern movies and arguably life today.This is testament to the wonderful acting from Robbins and Freeman, and\u000aindeed across the board. The supporting cast is excellent, from the\u000acorrupt Warden Norton (Bob Gunton) and his viciously sadistic Captain\u000aHadley (Clancy Brown), to the kind, institutionalized librarian Brooks\u000a(James Whitmore), every character in Shawshank is well rounded and\u000abrilliantly acted. And as if all that wasn't enough, the soundtrack,\u000acomposed by Thomas Newman, is hauntingly beautiful and perfectly\u000acomplements the film throughout its 2.5 hours.The Shawshank Redemption is an emotional roller-coaster in that it\u000atruly offers everything, from devastating and disturbing lows to\u000aheart-warming highs, and even elements of comedy where appropriate.\u000aThis movie has such depth and whilst not being preachy in any way, it\u000ahas many lessons to offer through Andy's character. Andy, for me,\u000aembodies the perfect human, caught up in a hurricane of bad luck; he\u000aonly once complains about his fate, the rest of the time he seems to\u000afind goodness in most situations and spends his sentence improving the\u000alives of those around him.This is epitomized by Red's story who, despite our protagonist being\u000aAndy, is our eyes and ears, our story teller and ultimately the one\u000aredeemed. Red, the self-proclaimed "only guilty man in Shawshank" is\u000aall but institutionalized after 30 years in those walls, but it's Andy\u000awho gradually shows him the power of hope, of integrity and of not\u000aforgetting who you are. He enables him to free himself after being\u000afreed from Shawshank.It comes down to a simple choice really. Get busy living, or get busy\u000adying.\u000a

V\u000a'The Shawshank Redeption' is hands-down the most overrated film of the\u000alast thirty years. I saw it theatrically when it was first released,\u000aand caught snatches of it on TV over the years since. I used to think\u000athat it was just another so-so prison film until the AFI bumped "The\u000aThird Man" out of their top 100 films to make room for this mediocrity.\u000aNeedless to say, I was shocked (also by the percentage of "best film\u000aever" reviews on IMDb and elsewhere). A friend presented a theory that\u000a'The Shawshank Redemption' is the cinematic equivalent of 'The Oprah\u000aWinfrey Show'...a portal through which guilt-ridden white liberals can\u000afeel "hope" and (decidedly un-Christian) "spirituality" while imagining\u000awhat it would be like to have a real African-American as a best friend.\u000aIn that way, it's something of a litmus test for liberals. Personally,\u000aI don't know any leftist who doesn't love it, or any conservative (or\u000aeven libertarian) who thinks very much of the film. It would be\u000ainteresting to do a survey of voters in the last Presidential election\u000aand their top ten favorite films. I'm guessing that this one would have\u000auniversal appeal to those who were mesmerized by empty promises of\u000a"Hope" and "Change".\u000a

V\u000aThis movie (Shawshank Redemption) is a pathetic ripe off of escape from\u000aAlcatraz and some other fine movies. kign even says he based the book\u000aon movies he saw growing up. if you plagiarise more then one source its\u000astill plagiarism. I thought the movie was decent until I saw Eastwoods\u000amovie, then I new itwas pure junk.- steals the characters - steals even the pet animal - steals his job\u000ain the jail - steals the method of escapeShawshank Redemption steals everything but replaces Clint Eastwoods\u000aacting with amateurs. how Stephen King didn't get lambasted for\u000aplagiarism is beyond me. This must be something he only edited for his\u000asack. I am sure most of the filming adding in these details and it\u000adoesn't even follow the book. I do not see how such a blatant ripe off is considered to be the best\u000amovie of all time by IMDb. It really takes away all of your\u000acredibility.Both movies using a poster to cover a hole in the wall. There are just\u000afar too many similarities between the two movies for this to be\u000aaccepted. If this was a university paper I would expect an expulsion.I guess they figure they can change the old mans pet from a bird to a\u000arat and everything is OK. because that clearly changes the entire\u000astory. Lastly no one in the movie was redeemed.\u000a

V\u000aI have seen this movie and think it is very good, Tim Robbins is really\u000agood in it and Morgan Freeman as usual is great. It has a lot of\u000aoriginal ideas and is deserving of much praise, however i really feel\u000ait lacks something that The Godfathers 1 and 2 have. They are just a\u000adifferent caliber of movie no offense to it, its very good. However Al\u000aPacino in both of those films is as close to perfect of a performance\u000aas you will ever get. I really feel because it is 35 years old so many\u000apeople of todays generation has not seen it, I am 20 and own all three\u000aand can appreciate the talent by Marlon Brando and Al Pacino in the\u000afirst film and Al in the second with Francis Ford Coppola directing\u000aboth. I understand that when someone sees a movie and they would like\u000ato rate it on this site its difficult to see all the other movies on\u000athe top 250, but when you are dealing with the top 5 its not that hard,\u000asee those movies and then judge.\u000a

V\u000aI don't understand how this movie managed to get to Number one on this\u000asite. While it's a good movie with talented actors, it's just not as\u000aentertaining and solid as other movies that i believe deserve the top\u000aranking. I enjoyed watching it, and it really doesn't deserve the 1/10 rating\u000aI've given it (thats only to bring it lower on the top 250) it just\u000aisn't as good as other movies I have seen and loved such as\u000a'Trainspotting', 'Pulp Fiction' and 'Donnie Darko' for example. These movies are solid performances with a strong theme in one\u000adirection, while I feel that The Shawshank Redemption flounders around\u000awith it's, slightly lame, hope and friendship theme, thats just not as\u000aentertaining as others.\u000a

V\u000a\u000aThis movie is clearly a weak copy of "Escape from Alcatraz"(1979)\u000aThe scene where Andy drops the grit is directly and without\u000aany effort from Frank Darabont to hide the fact that he has little\u000afantasy,\u000acopied from Escape from Alcatraz.\u000aThe sphere that is created in The Shawshank Redemption is meek whereas the\u000asphere that is created in Escape from Alcatraz is thrilling and you can\u000areally feel the tension in the prison.\u000aThe closed ending of this movie is for people, like Frank Darabont, that\u000ahave little fantasy.\u000aThe sublime open ending in Escape from Alcatraz leaves room for the\u000aviewer\u000ato fantasize on what happened to the prisoners.\u000a

V\u000aI can't think of any movie more monstrously overrated than The\u000aShawshank Redemption. Giving it only one star may seem harsh but\u000aconsidering all the undeserved praise heaped on this mediocre and dull\u000amovie I think it's fair. I watched it on TV and it is good enough for\u000asome entertainment for a few hours if you're too tired to do anything\u000aelse but that's about it. It is predictable and unimaginative: innocent\u000aguy (well we never learn if he is if I remember correctly but as he is\u000asuch a nice fellow we're supposed to think so), sexually assaulted,\u000aescapes and there you have it and that's all there is to it. Of course\u000aMorgan Freeman and Tim Robbins are good actors but I can't think of\u000aanything more nice to say about this movie.\u000a

V\u000aThere is absolutely nothing redeeming about this maudlin Hollywood\u000apackage.

If it would have been about women\u000ainstead of men, it would have been dismissed as the schmaltzfest that\u000ait is. It isn't even courageous enough to admit that it is a gay love\u000astory.

Morgan Freeman was even more\u000adreadful and has been giving the same dreadful performance ever since.\u000aI don't expect much depth from Stephen King-inspired movies, but\u000a"Children of the Corn" was insightful in comparison to this dribble.\u000a

V\u000a"The Shawshank Redemption" or "Shawshank" as I'm sure it's said to\u000adeath in the film is an elongated short story that just 'lingers' from\u000aone hour to the next. There's no real 'charm' to the film except of\u000acourse 'dry wit' from Red as if it's the gospel according to Red. He\u000abasically plugs Andy the entire movie as if he's his agent. "Now Andy\u000athis" and "Andy that". Not to mention a walking brochure for\u000apenitentiaries "Shawshank this" and "Shawhank that" his gospel just\u000anever lets up.Now Tim Robbins was perfectly cast for about 5 minutes playing 'the\u000ababe in the woods' who "looks like a stiff breeze would blow him over"\u000aa "tall drink of water with a silver spoon up his ass". But once\u000anothing seems to break him, its definitely a part for Mel Gibson. Tim\u000aRobbins didn't have the 'acting chops' to bring the 'required depth' to\u000athis character. Fortunate for Robbins in post production Morgan Freeman\u000asaved his ass with extensive voice overs. Most people think this was\u000apremeditated but 'the truth' is Robbins gave such a wooden performance\u000ait was necessary.Most people think this isn't your average prison drama ether because\u000aits not about violence and melodrama. But 'the truth' is this film is\u000ano better than your TV movie of the week that features a 'prison\u000aescape'. The whole 'poster thing' couldn't be more 'implausible' if an\u000aelephant hang from a cliff by a daisy. Don't let me get started on how\u000ahe just happened to have the cell on the end ether! The music was\u000a'elevator music' at best. The only time I even took notice was when\u000athey actually featured it in the plot And even then if I'd heard it id\u000ahave personally punctured my eardrums. Why the 'sound' was nominated\u000afor an academy award is beyond me. If it weren't for packaging and\u000adistribution this film would be a made for TV movie. Which it was if\u000ayou consider its box office taking against home rental.The entire cast reeked 'cartoon'. You have your 'evil' warden with his\u000a'religion'. You have your 'mean' guards you 'grow to love'. Not to\u000amention 'the kid', 'the old guy', 'the black guy' and 'the guys'. The\u000aprison was so stereotypical it even had 'fags'. Some other failings of\u000athis 'pathetic' movie. The dialogue was 'harebrained'. If it was\u000asupposed to fascinate, well, it 'failed'. The manner in which the mini\u000astories unfolded was 'not stimulating'. His ability to get beers and do\u000ataxes in particular 'sucked'.In short this film 'sucked'. Worst film 'since', well since ever!\u000a

Anyway the only thing that\u000asaves the film of Morgan Freeman and it is only thing that even got me to\u000asee this film in the first place but it still can't stop me from giving\u000athis\u000aa poor grade.2/10  \u000a

V\u000ai had to comment, i really did, all those eulogies on what is in\u000areality a hackneyed complacent pretentious film. Nothing that this film\u000asays challenges any principle or thought- its purpose is to confirm\u000aevery conservative, sentimental, instinct in us all. And yet it has a\u000asense of its own putative profundities, and bulldozes these throughout\u000athe film. Really what the film is saying is neither profound nor\u000aoriginal, and is not to my mind worth saying in the first place at\u000aleast not at such length- ie life is hard, people suffer, but through\u000astruggle the human spirit will win through, learn to make friends and\u000aget their deserved reward - mmm. Nothing makes any of the characters\u000areal, and the actors are not helped by this terrible overloaded\u000anarration which applies a great weight on the story which cannot breath\u000aas every moment is made to seem sooo significant. It is not just that\u000athere is no lightness of touch in the direction, or that there is no\u000ahumour, it is that there is a sense that what is being described is\u000amore important than humour, or than the real nature of friendship.\u000aSuffice to say i loathe this film and recommend people watch it only as\u000aa lesson in what is bad about big budget Hollywood movies.\u000a

V\u000aOver-long, boring, tedious, over-acted and very very very very very\u000aOVER-RATED. Hell knows what goes through the minds of people to vote\u000athis the 2nd best film EVER!! I first saw the cut down version lasting\u000a1 hour 25 minutes, and it was still too long.I wouldn't mind but it's so drawn-out, fanciful and pathetic. The\u000athings that happen in that prison would never happen, just because some\u000anerdy bank manager has "hope..." Give me a break! Which soap opera did\u000athat sad line come from! No wonder it was initially ignored, and it\u000ashould be continued to be ignored. Robbins, who is accused and wrongly\u000aconvicted for the murders of his wife and her lover, never ages. At one\u000apoint he HAS TO "remind" us he's been in jail for 12 years, because it\u000aonly looks like a week.Yet did you see the way he really changed in 12 years from 1994 to\u000a2006. He looks a much older man. And of course he does, he's 12 years\u000aolder!! In the Shamshank Dedeption he never aged one day in 12 years,\u000aand his hair is even cut the same style.Even when we then go forward something like 20 years, he still looks\u000athe same, never aged at all, apart from a few bluey grey hairs at the\u000asides. And after he escapes (after 20 years of tunnelling through thick\u000aconcrete with a a small screwdriver), he meets up with his old buddy\u000aFreeman, who got out of jail legally. And get this, BOTH look younger\u000athan when they first went in.By my reckoning Tim Robbins should now be about 70, and Morgan Freeman\u000ain his early 80s, yet both after serving their time still look barely\u000a40.And what a load of talkative rubbish. The most boring over-hyped-up\u000afilm in history. Complete twaddle. God knows how on earth I watched all\u000aof it, but I did if for a bet, 'cause I cannot stand it. Wasn't worth a\u000aUK tenner anyway!! My vote, 2 out of 10 for a mediocre drama.Get a life, if this is the "best" film you've even seen. Better still,\u000aget a cinema ticket!!!! Or rent a DVD. And more than one!!\u000a

V\u000a\u000aPeople wonder why I hate this movie so much, and I have to say that its\u000ajust\u000apurely unoriginal.  I mean c'mon... how many times have you heard the\u000astory\u000aof a guy who's wrongfully accused of a crime and somehow escapes prison\u000ausing a stupid spoon? If there's one thing I look for in a movie, then\u000ait's\u000agot to be originality.  I'll let it go if its based on a novel, or a\u000amusical, but c'mon... a plot this unoriginal doesn't deserve any credit!\u000a\u000a

Please feel free to argue with me over this but come on\u000apeople step back and look at the film what is it made up of? Then look at\u000aThe Godfather look at what that is made up of - Brill cast, excellent\u000aplot,\u000adamn good script, good directing and camera work everything is perfect\u000athen\u000alook back at the Shawshank redemption its just at a completely different\u000alevel.

V\u000a\u000aThe only thing that amazes me about this movie is that it is not only\u000awithin\u000a500 top movies in IMDB but actually #2 and soon perhaps #1...I only saw Shawshank Redemption once, and have not been able to force\u000amyself\u000ato watch it in full length ever since. It was ok to see it once even\u000athough\u000aI was almost bored then, but not quite. I found it very average in every\u000arespect, and quite predictable. I guess that this is one of those movies\u000athat is so average that it does not bother anybody by invoking powerful\u000aemotions, thoughts or memories, and does not have any obviously bad\u000atechnical quality. Just sooo average. Hence the high score?\u000a\u000a

V\u000aThis drama has been widely vaunted as one of the best films ever made-\u000apersonally I just can't see the appeal. Sure it contains very good\u000aperformances by Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman- but there have been\u000aother, much better screen performances by other actors. There is very\u000alittle suspense or originality about the plot and nothing that hasn't\u000abeen seen or done on screen a hundred times before. So why the\u000apopularity? It's a formulaic feel-good movie who's happy ending is\u000anever in doubt. Knowing that Stephen King wrote the novel on which the\u000afilm was based would probably give that away anyway. As with any\u000aadaptation from book to film there are several differences between the\u000atwo, though the film does, on this occasion, improve on the book.There have been better adaptations of King novels (The Shining) and\u000abetter performances by better actors, yet for some reason this film\u000acontinues to be rated as better than it actually is.\u000a

V\u000a\u000a Obviously I missed the point of this movie.  After years of people telling\u000ame how fantastic it was and noting how high it regularly comes in opinion\u000apolls, I finally watched it recently.Somehow I seem to have come to completely the opposite conclusion to almost\u000aeveryone else.  Maybe my expectations were too high but I was very, very\u000adisappointed.  The plot was predictable and dull, the directing pretty\u000adroll.  Not much else I can say about it, other than to ask people if I have\u000amissed something key that would alter my perception of this film?Who am I to go against the vast popularity of this picture?

V\u000aThe basic story for this dreadful movie is Andy Dufresne is a young and\u000asuccessful banker whose life changes drastically when he is convicted\u000aand sentenced to life imprisonment for the murder of his wife and her\u000alover. Set in the 1940's, the film shows how Andy, with the help of his\u000afriend Red, the prison entrepreneur, turns out to be a most\u000aunconventional prisoner i think am missing something with this movie,\u000ahaving now seen it twice. Its 1 of the most predictable boring movies i\u000ahave ever seen. The bit were all the prisoners stop and listen to the\u000aopera music is just laughable. This just would not happen with hardened\u000aprisoners. This is also one of the poorest performances i have seen\u000afrom Morgan freeman, why he took this role on i will never know. Go\u000awatch the Green Mile, its much finer work from the duo of Stephen King\u000aand Frank Darabont\u000a

V\u000aSaying this is the #2 movie of all-time is like saying McDonald's makes\u000athe best hamburgers. They're both palatable, predictable, inoffensive\u000aproducts that are easy to digest. Both have happy endings-- that is, if\u000ayou find the stunning speed with which a McDonald's hamburger flushes\u000aout your digestive tract to be a "happy" occasion.All you need to know is that Shawshank has the exact same ending as\u000a"Trading Places." So why not make "Trading Places" the greatest comedy\u000aof all-time?? What the hell, why not make it #3 on IMDb? It too is\u000acompetent and utterly middle-of-the road in terms of quality and\u000aoriginality within its genre.Instead of Dan Ackroyd and Eddie Murphy laughing it up on a Caribbean\u000abeach after besting the forces of evil, we get Morgan Freeman and Tim\u000aRobbins. It's the exact same ending! Shawshank was OK when I saw it\u000awhen it came out. But count me among the backlash group that would\u000arather see it with the 6-7 rating that it deserves. Thusly, I hereby\u000acast my symbolic 1-star vote.\u000a

V\u000a\u000aThis is certainly a good movie, with universal themes of freedom and\u000aadversity etc etc, but... I've seen plenty of movies which were more\u000aartfully made than this one. There is nothing revolutionary in the\u000adirecting. The novella by Stephen King is practically tailor-made for a\u000amovie adaption, and it seems any capable director could have made a good\u000amovie from it. I think the only reason this movie is #2 on this list is\u000athe\u000asheer amount of people who have seen it and voted. The other truly great\u000amovies near the top of the list don't pack the same mass audience appeal\u000athat Shawshank Redemption does, nor are they shown on TNT 6-10 times a\u000ayear.\u000aMovies like 2001, The Seven Samurai, or Lawrence of Arabia, for example,\u000awould bore many of the people who love Shawshank Redemption, and I\u000apersonally consider those three I named and many others to be far better\u000acreations than the Shawshank Redemption. Perhaps we should take a poll of\u000aTNT viewers on the best movie of all time - I'd bet Shawshank Redemption\u000awould place first, with The Blues Brothers coming in a close\u000asecond.\u000a

There was a story in here\u000asomewhere but it got over-inflated and somewhat lost along the way.One to watch on a rainy day when there's nothing better to do.\u000a\u000a

V\u000aI would humbly suggest that before praising or damning the "Shawshank\u000aRedemption", that one take a considered look at the New York Times\u000a"Best 1000 Films Ever Made" list. Unfortunately, the guidelines of this\u000asite preclude me,oh gentle reader, from giving you the URL. One should\u000abe able to Google it, so all is not lost.The NYT was good enough to excerpt the list from Peter Nichols' The\u000a"New York Times Guide to the 1,000 Best Films Ever Made".What ? The "Shawshank Redemption" is not on this list, you say ?Perhaps, humble viewer, you haven't seen enough films of the first\u000arank. But, have no fear, this is a remediable condition. But, be a dear\u000aand do try to see some of the movies on the list,please, before voting\u000aon this site. I really hate to see so many people make the mistake of\u000avoting for the wrong sort of movies onto the top 10 of IMDb's very\u000ainteresting site. It's ever so declasse.Remember, an educated public is an informed public. Now, do your part.\u000a

V\u000a\u000aWell made prison buddy drama has no rough edges. Its so clean cut and\u000aconventional its not funny, literally. Its involving, you care for the\u000acharacters, and are interested in what happens to them. But quite frankly,\u000ait feels so literary, Morgan Freeman's voiceover sounding exactly like a\u000aStephen King narration (which it is). By the way, the way Red (Morgan\u000aFreeman) tells the story of mystery man Andy Dufresne(Tim Robbins) is as old\u000aas Watson telling of mystery man Sherlock Holmes - this formula was invented\u000aby Arthur Conan Doyle. Stephen King has a way of writing that always feels\u000alike he's appealing to the masses: always trying to sound nostalgic and\u000aprofound. Instead of just telling a story that's honest, you feel there's\u000athis constant need to say something about life, the universe and everything.\u000aCountless instances of pretensious philosophising abound in this - which\u000asound about as profound as sayings your grandfather tells you: "some birds\u000aare not meant to be caged, their feathers are too bright" or "Get busy\u000aliving, or get busy dying" or "Terrible thing, to live in fear" or "It was\u000alike some beautiful bird flapped into our drab little cage and made those\u000awalls dissolve away" or "need it so you don't forget. Forget that there are\u000aplaces in the world that aren't made out of stone" or "Hope is a good thing,\u000aand good things can never die" - if you say so, sensei!Also, King's stories always feel like someone has sat there trying to think\u000aof a good story, instead of feeling natural. So the reason most things\u000ahappen in this movie, all the little episodes, are not because it\u000anecessarily fits the character - but because it would make a good story for\u000ait to happen that way. And after a while, this gets tiring - i just can't\u000atake it seriously.Morgan Freeman sounds like grandfather telling a story - which can sometimes\u000afeel patronising, but i suppose to does work well with the period feel of\u000athis picture, which, by definition, tries to connect with the past. Problem\u000ais Stephen King never leaves anything to the imagination. He tells us\u000aeverything - if Tim Robbins organises some special event for the inmates,\u000alike playing music over the loudspeaker, Morgan Freeman's voice will come\u000aright out and suggest a few reasons why this episode is so\u000awonderful/significant, the nature of which are very similar through each\u000aepisode of the movie. And Darabont obviously likes the idea of assuming the\u000aaudience are very thick, and will not see or experience anything unless you\u000adictate to them what to experience, and has made his movie by it.Also, i'm starting to be wary of Thomas Newman as a composer doing exactly\u000awhat Darabont has done as a director: employ a formula that has worked in\u000athe past. His score for Shawshank is calculated on the same  formula of\u000ahighs, lows, and general atmosphere as in his score for Road to Perdition,\u000aAmerican Beauty, Meet Joe Black, Horse Whisperer, Scent of a Woman, and The\u000aGreen Mile, not surprisingly. If you think about all these movies, they all\u000ahave a similar feel, they all go for a similar nostalgia, haunting sadness -\u000awhich admittedly i find very appealing, but i'm starting to worry at how\u000asimilar they all are.I think encouraging this movie too much is like rewarding someone for\u000aemploying a formula very successfully - instead of taking risks and doing\u000asomething edgy that still turns out to be enjoyable and brilliant. Most\u000apeople do not evaluate movies based on their imdb ranking, but i certainly\u000awould be surprised if any major lists ranked this in their top\u000aten.That said, this is still a very good movie, with good performances, a good\u000aunity, despite its necessarily episodic nature, and it looks great. Its only\u000afor movies people insist on putting on best-ever lists that i require a\u000acertain originality, the feeling that what this movie gives you you could\u000anot get anywhere else (i believe this is why movies like Citizen Kane,\u000aVertigo, 2001, Raging Bull, Third Man, Grand Illusion, Persona and, for me,\u000aExterminating Angel, are constantly mentioned on such lists, and\u000adeservedly). What this movie gave me, i could get from reading any other\u000aStephen King story, or seeing any other movie adaptation of a King\u000astory.So my review is mainly in backlash against this movie's being regarded so\u000ahighly, but when it comes down to it, as i said, i enjoyed it, and thought\u000ait was a five star movie.\u000a

V\u000aThere are some things in this life we will never understand... How did\u000athe universe begin? What happens to our souls when we die? How did a\u000amovie as bland as The Shawshank Redemption become so overrated?In the case of certain other movies, I can at least understand the\u000areasons why they're overrated. But The Shawshank Redemption is so...\u000aaverage. And cliché-ridden. The film's moral is basically that hope is\u000aimportant, and there's nothing wrong with that in itself. Heck - I have\u000ano problem with simplicity. The problem is when you move past the\u000asimple and into the land of the simplistic. The movie treats its\u000aborrowed plot parts (Count of Monte Cristo, anyone?) and banal themes\u000aas though they were freshly minted nuggets of wisdom. (I wouldn't be\u000acomplaining if it didn't pretend to be anything more than a pleasant\u000adiversion.) However, it is with its very last shot that the movie\u000areveals its true condescending colours. If it had ended moments earlier\u000ainstead, with that poetic shot of the sea, I would have had some\u000arespect for it (that's where the superior original story ends). But no,\u000athe director had to spell things out for his audience. Frank Darabont\u000aknows how to tell a story. He just doesn't know how to tell one with\u000aany originality or depth.The movie is partially redeemed by three things. The majestic\u000acinematography, the powerful score, and most of all, Morgan Freeman,\u000aone of the very best actors working today.As for my rating, yes I'm one of those jerks who gives a movie a 1 just\u000ato lower it on the top 250. I think it's outrageous how highly it's\u000aranked here. Even the folks who made it would think it's ridiculous to\u000aconsider it one of the greatest films ever made.\u000a

V\u000a\u000aShawshank Redemption has been elevated in popular opinion to the status\u000aof masterpiece because of one irrefutable virtue. It is accessible.\u000aRegrettably, as is true in so many cases, popular opinion is an\u000ainaccurate gauge of this picture's actual quality. The reason this film\u000ahas attained its current level of acclaim is that it is impossible to\u000amisinterpret its theme or message, impossible to be offended by it,\u000aimpossible to be confused by. However, as this review should show, it\u000ais entirely possible to be unimpressed by "Shawshank."The story of Shawshank Redemption is something I might expect if I was\u000abeing pitched a script by middle schoolers. The complex coincidental\u000aframeup, the daring escape, the clear cut definitions of good and evil.\u000athe timeless friendship finally and uneventfully consummated on a\u000abeautiful shoreline. Each step more unsurprising than the last, each\u000abeat more clichéd that the last. Every time the filmmakers feel like\u000abuilding tension or revealing something about the characters, they take\u000athe most obvious road. This might be excusable if the road didn't also\u000alead to the most obvious destinations.People also praise the acting in the film. While it isn't at all bad,\u000ait's hard to be impressed when the actors are playing such simplistic\u000aroles. Stereotypes when acted well are still boring.I sincerely hope that over time, when the film has settled into history\u000aand once people are more able to set this pandering film along side its\u000aheavily plundered predecessors, it will become clear that it offers\u000anothing new, and that what it does offer it doesn't even offer all that\u000awell.\u000a\u000a

V\u000aIt bugs me that this movie is rated so high- not because it's a "bad"\u000amovie, but because it's a mediocre one. Apparently, mediocre people\u000areward mediocre cinema. This movie tanked big-time when it was\u000ainitially released, and with good reason. It wasn't until\u000apseudo-intellectuals across the country started hyping it as defacto\u000a"favorite movie" for Lowbrows world-wide that it started dominating the\u000aIMDb "best movie" list. In reality, "Shawshank" is like a sewage pump\u000afor every idiotic Prison Movie cliché ever made. Every guard is a\u000amonster. The warden is religious, therefore Evil. Not a single prisoner\u000ais actually guilty, or if they are, they're so obviously redeemed that\u000awe're supposed to feel sorry for their unfair imprisonment. Murderers\u000aand sex offenders sit around in beatific awe as Opera plays over the\u000aloudspeakers. Right. The whole movie is so fake, so smarmy, and so\u000acondescending that it's no wonder that so many Americans, (with their\u000aodd addiction to fake, smarmy, condescending things) consider it their\u000a"favorite movie". I guess thinking for yourself is a burden to great\u000afor some of us to bear.\u000a

V\u000aI've seen a lot of movies in my days.. This one was fine, but not the\u000abest. A movie should keep you entertained, not make you think - "When\u000ais this going to END?" Did not deserve to be N1 in IMDb. All that surrealism, mostly boring in\u000aparts even disturbing. Maybe few of you will enjoy it, but I think it\u000awould be better if there was more done in less time rather than the\u000aopposite. The same old stuff happens, like a soup opera. You like it in\u000athe binging, you say to your self - "This will be good, IMDb was\u000aright." but an hour later you think " Yeaah, been there done that, lets\u000aturn it off..".Think about it, was this the best you've ever seen? No?\u000a

V\u000aThis is good example of how to not to make a movie. It begins quite\u000adry. The main character doesn't seem like he quite knows how to act as\u000ahe is thrown into a poorly lit scene in what seems to be the director's\u000agarage revamped. He then goes to prison. NO SENSE WHATSOEVER! Obviously\u000athere is a huge paradigm between what the director though the film to\u000abe and the original writers.We then see all of what we normally find in prison, with a very fatal\u000aexception. NO MINING! I am a personal favorite of mining in prison. I\u000alove to see people smash rocks and burn coal for fire. We mainly find\u000adry dialog from what appears to be actors who have never left their\u000aparent's basement (no wonder the director still films at his home). I\u000ahad to leave the room a few times so that I could get some fresh air\u000awhile the movie attempted be filmed. My advice is to buy this film only if you need a DVD or VHS tape for a\u000ascrap booking project. The reflective qualities are very nice and the\u000apackaging insert can also be used to store a home video. Be sure not to\u000aallow the label to be visible, as that may cause your friends to disown\u000ayou forever.\u000a

V\u000ai pretty much hated this movie. its a prison movie, so plot is\u000abasically Tim robins gets framed than raped and eventually escapes.\u000aMorgan freeman is locked up and i don't know he just acts like a kid in\u000athis. i understand he's suppose to be locked up since he was a teen but\u000areally he's giving the same performance here as his role as god in\u000aBruce almighty. even though he's miscast he honestly carries the movie,\u000amainly because Tim robins does nothing in this movie. some other\u000asubplots include Tim teaching some idiot to read or something, some old\u000aguy hangs himself, they deck a roof,freeman sneaks in a hammer and\u000arobins makes chess pieces, i'll stop the the point i'm making is this\u000amovie is excruciatingly boring. number one on IMDb, are you kidding me?\u000aeven from a technical standpoint this movie blows. everything is just\u000adull and unimpressive, hell it looks more like a TV movie than a film.\u000ai'd describe the tone of this as Disney's take on jail movies. it's to\u000aconcerned with being safe and classy to accurately represent prison\u000alife. everyone's favorite part of this is the ending, and that sucked\u000atoo. Tim robins apparently escapes prison with a rock hammer, after\u000adigging through his cell wall for like twenty years. his hiding place\u000ais a poster? really? to make matters more hilarious he has crawls\u000athrough a tunnel of poop and emerges from a poop lake in a failed\u000aattempt to move the audience. Morgan freeman gets paroled by basically\u000ainsulting the judges, than he goes to a rock in some random place that\u000aTim told him to visit, and than goes to Mexico and finds Tim on a boat.\u000areunited and roll credits, oh yeah Morgan freeman also married his\u000astep- granddaughter. that's the dumbest ending ever written. there's so\u000amuch better stuff you could be watching instead of shawshank like porn\u000aor riki-oh.\u000a

V\u000aShawshank is by far the most grossly overrated films of all time. To\u000asay that this is better than Lawrence of Arabia, better than Alien,\u000aBetter then Saving Private Ryan, is just ridiculous. This movie is\u000aweak, as are all the characters in it. I'll never forgot the scene\u000awhere the old man hangs himself after leaving prison and the piano\u000asymphony kicks in. Why should I feel sorry for him? Try living in\u000aAfrica buddy and tell me how hard your life is. This movie is for weak\u000apeople who love to shed a tear for prisoners and overall just weak\u000apeople. Now I love the director of this and Stephen King, but im sorry,\u000athis isn't a masterpiece, it's forcing the audience into the characters\u000aemotional problems that few can relate. Go see the Green Mile instead.Rating = D-- VideoGameHollywood.com\u000a

V\u000aWhy this film is so highly rated is beyond me. First of all, where is\u000athe redemption? The characters do nothing that can be construed as\u000aredeeming (except for the one played by Gil Bellows). They simply\u000asurvive. Someone who also doesn't like the film compares it to a fairy tale\u000abecause it's unrealistic. This is an insult to fairy tales. Fairy tales\u000aare beautiful and deep, with complex motives transmitted throughout the\u000acenturies, the traditional good-bad dichotomy and a clear moral\u000aconclusion. The Shawshank Redemption is dull, with some basic and\u000acarefully explained symbolism (because apparently we're too stupid to\u000aget it otherwise) and, contrary to traditional notions of morality, the\u000ahero's sidekicks are some nice criminals. Of course, prison staff are\u000acast as the bad guys and their boss is portrayed as a hypocrite\u000aspeaking of the Bible yet acting in an un-Christian manner. Can you say\u000aanti-Christian bigotry?\u000a

V\u000aEven do I think this film is highly enjoyable I will rate it with only\u000aone star. This is due to the fact that I think its position at the IMDb\u000atop 250 is really unfair. There are many movies that surpass this one\u000ain many aspects and they should be above this title. I don't exactly\u000aknow how the system works since the only votes that count are the ones\u000afrom regular voters (when do you become one?) but I will try to lower\u000aits position rating this film with only one star even do I think it\u000adeserves 6 or 7.The performances are truly above average but I think that the\u000acharacters are not near as memorable. On the other hand I liked the\u000aphotography a lot and the story is really good but I think the movie\u000ashould have ended about 10 minutes before (Like No Country for Old\u000aMen).I wrote this comment only to encourage people to do the same thing. I\u000aam glad to see comments like mine which makes me thing that not\u000aeverybody consider this title as the best movie ever (because it is\u000anot). I know it is a matter of subjectivity but when too many people\u000agive this film 10 stars we are denying that there are better films out\u000athere.\u000a

V\u000aWhen I searched amongst the endless lists of reviews given about this\u000amovie, I had not found one that gave it less than 7 stars. In order to\u000atruly see a movie for what it is, one must look past all that makes it\u000agreat into its minor flaws and weaknesses. If you (the reader) were\u000adrawn to this review because of the low rating, well I am sorry but I\u000ahave mislead you. However, I have also led you to something greater and\u000adifferent from the rest of the reviews for this film.To get to the point, Shawshank Redemption is magnificently made and\u000adeserves incredible amounts of praise for its entertainment value and\u000aperspective on life in prison. However, the themes of the film are\u000arather shallow. The entire theme can be summarized in a short sentence:\u000aFriendship and hope can get you through almost anything. Although it is\u000aa great message, it is simply a nugget of what could have been much\u000agreater.Now I know that I have only given the film 1 star here, but that was\u000aonly to draw attention so that you may finally see that this film,\u000aalthough superb, is not perfect by any means as is suggested by the\u000avast quantity of perfect reviews. In all honesty I would give it nine\u000astars out of ten and would encourage everybody to see it.Great, not perfect, but after all, where can true perfection honestly\u000abe found?\u000a

I therefore, call for a\u000a"surge" of negative reviews to be leveled against this mediocre film so\u000athat with the help of Mark Twain and his angels we will be able to oust\u000ait from its ill-deserved spot as IMDb #1 movie of all time.

V\u000a\u000aThis film is story driven rather than character driven which means it'll\u000aalways be liked by people but will never be one of the all-time greats. I\u000ahave no problem with the plot design - it's well assembled and effectively\u000aclimaxed. Overall, a well thought out entertaining film. The dialogue and\u000acharacterisation devices however were cheesy and untrue to the world of\u000athe\u000astory.1)The new inmates line up for a speech from the warden. One inmate growls:\u000a"When do we eat?". Unrealistic and unnecessary. He might well have said:\u000a"Please hit me several times so the audience can see how brutal this\u000aprison\u000ais." The brutality of the prison is conveyed when crying fat boy gets\u000akicked\u000ato death, so this addition is pointless.2)The story had already established freemans and robbins friendship, when\u000afreeman leans over to robbins and says: "We're kinda becomin friends\u000aaren't\u000awe?" Can you ever imagine any grown adult actually saying that to\u000aanother?3)Worst scene of the film: the music scene. The film uses music to\u000asymbolise\u000athe theme of hope (robbins mind music in the hole, freemans harmonica).\u000aThis\u000ais first introduced when robbins locks himself in the office and blares\u000aloud\u000amusic all over the prison. Yeah OK, willful main character. But when the\u000awarden and guards shout for him to turn it off, what does he do? He sits\u000aback with feet up and smug grin plastered on his face. The guards bang\u000aagain\u000aand again. What does he do? He leans over to the gramaphone and turns the\u000avolume up. I mean, come on, do me a favour. His punishment is a month in\u000athe\u000ahole, and for a simple reason. If the scriptwriter had shown the guards\u000abreaking in and kicking him almost to death (which is what really would\u000ahave\u000ahappened), then the audience is left thinking: "What a fool". The scene\u000awas\u000asilly and should've been rethought.Finally, can someone please tell me how he got that poster of Racquel\u000aWelch\u000aback on the wall after he climbed frontways into that tunnel?I give it an 8 out of 10.\u000a

No great performances (a phoned-in\u000aMorgan Freeman performance akin to his "Deep Impact" presidential\u000aperformance), no graphic portrayals or stark realism of life behind\u000abars--nothing.

V\u000a\u000aShawshank Redemption is overrated.\u000aIt's a decent, above average film, but by no means a great\u000afilm.The inmates are pretty much likeable, while the warden and his pet guard are\u000amonsters. Also as Freeman's character says: "You know that everybody in\u000ahere's innocent?" As the story develops you feel like he is right, the only\u000acriminals are the ones guarding the prisoners.This is a sentimental piece made to stir the emotions, but not to stir them\u000atoo much. Just enough to make the viewer feel there is injustice in the\u000aworld but that in the end everything ends well and justice surely comes to\u000ahe who waits 20 years or so for it.The Shawshank Redemption is, as I said, a decent film, possibly among the\u000atop five films of 1994.\u000aIMO the best films of 1994 are Pulp Fiction and Léon.\u000a

V\u000ajust read the title. Tough I think it's a pretty decent movie (but not\u000aas good as the Stephen King's novel) i just can't understand why it\u000ashould deserve to be ahead of everyone else in the top 250 (with the\u000aexception of the godfather). To be honest i don't even really think it\u000ashould be in the top 250. Yeah, I know you Americans love the\u000ahappy-ending Vaseline-flavored subtly homosexual jail movies, but all\u000athis hype it's too much anyway. Come on, this can't be better than\u000aWelles, Kubrick, Kurosawa or Scorsese (or not even Carpenter and Fulci\u000ain my humble opinion) So I give it a 1/10. This is not a critical\u000avaluation of the movie. This is a political statement.\u000a

V\u000a\u000aThis film is nothing but one cliche after another. Having seen many of the\u000a100's of prison films made from the early 30's to the 50's, I was able to\u000apull almost every minute of Shawcrap from one of those\u000afilms.While it is visually well made and acted, the story has every plot point\u000aof\u000athe "standard" prison film. They have the evil warden, innocent main\u000acharacter, friendly guilty guy, thugs and one good old prisoner. Don't\u000awaste\u000ayour time on this one. Rent or buy some of the classic's of the prison\u000agenre.\u000a

V\u000aShawshank is on TNT approximately five million times a year. It is the\u000asecond-highest rated film on IMDb, and it was nominated for seven\u000aOscars. It is a movie that can make grown men cry. Morgan Freeman and\u000aTim Robbins deliver great performances. Thomas Newman's original score\u000ais beautiful. It's an engaging film about perseverance, friendship,\u000awill power, and hope.But then again, does it really belong in the same company as Godfather,\u000aGodfather II, Schindler's List, and other consensus top-ten films? Is\u000ait really one of the ten best films of all time? First off, the villain\u000aof the film, Warden Norton, is an incredibly cartoonish, two\u000adimensional bad guy. He and Cal from Titanic could have a\u000a"pure-evil-for-the-sake-of-being-pure-evil" standoff. Aside from greed,\u000awe have no idea what made him who he was. The Warden is pure evil, and\u000ais willing to kill the prisoner who can help prove Andy's innocence in\u000acold blood. And yet, even though Andy is the one man who could expose\u000ahim and all his criminal dealings, he doesn't do the simplest thing and\u000ajust kill Andy. Why not? Because Andy has to wind up hugging Red on the\u000abeach years later.Secondly, think about the scene where Andy locks himself in a room and\u000aplays classical music over the loudspeakers to the rest of the\u000aprisoners, who stop in the courtyard and stare up in awe and wonder.\u000aAre you kidding me? The scene tries to be a powerful, emotional peak in\u000athe film, but it comes off as laughably implausible, even in the\u000a1950's.Finally, the movie makes it a little too easy on the audience by giving\u000ait all the answers. Is Andy guilty? Does he really escape? Will he and\u000aRed ever meet up again? Nothing is left for the audience to wonder\u000aabout, no ambiguity  everything is spoon-fed to the audience in tasty,\u000ahappy-ending bites, right up to the final "hug on the beach" scene.\u000aWait this movie ends with happy people hugging on a beach? Yes it\u000adoes.\u000a

V\u000alet's value it entertainment: the script is more than cliché, typical prison\u000abreak/escape movie. Morgan Freeman is OK, Tim Robins is so awful, in\u000aevery scene he looks like he is crying.. production value is so so..\u000arating 3/10 social message: the message of the movie is: life is good, society is\u000afair enough,when it is unfair,don't worry, look at the down syndrome\u000alooking guy Andy,with a probably below average intelligence, easily\u000aescaped the prison, when you get caught, do the same..the world is so\u000awonderful and hopeful..and American jails have better life than many\u000aother poor countries free life.....try a little,you can do\u000aanything..the message is complete wrong. rating -5/10 objectionable things: generally, nothing serious objectionable to me,\u000abut it's a bit black supremacist. it promotes typical black saint(magic\u000aNegro) image.. tells you blacks are morally superior than other\u000apeople.. it violates my principal that people are equal.. rating 5/10 so overall rating 1/10\u000a
